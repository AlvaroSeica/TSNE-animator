[Intro: Hussein Fatal]
Yea we ain't got nothing but pain and missery
So we choose to share this shit over the mic
Either that or we going to bleed eagle all the time.
Hussein Fatal the Outlaw don
what I bring to u besided the spirit on Makaveli the Don
Thugtertaiment, get down and lay down

[Verse 1: Killa Black]
I know niggas that run around not wanting to live
That will run up in ur crib and put one in ur wig
Fuck with the kid, Ill show you what a vegtible is
You ain't die but ur folks say its best if you did
Black is toubled, my mak got strapped and mussled
Either rap or its back to the crack to bubble
Time is short, these fiens on line to snort
I caught cases and lost trial ??? court
What you know about 23 and 1 in the box
C.o searchin down ur cell for the weed and the ox
Bed check gotta get on your bunk
And them gay ass cops strip search just 2 peep at ur nuts
Lock down late night thinkin life ain't fair
Ask ur wife for a visit, yea I might be there
Fuck everybody dawg is the way you feel
U ask me what my life is like, I tell you mine is real nigga

[Chorus: Hussein Fatal](x2)
Death b4 dishonor, Ill never worry
Eyes blurried saying goodbye at the cemitery
And Im squeezing on this trigger with hate
Till Im free and all these niggas relate

[Verse 2: Hussein Fatal]
Never been a victim, these guns I bought for bangin out
Cocking back dumpin punks in the way only hanigin out
Amuzed from the grey and the haze
Disillusioned from the sprey of the gauge
Ima gangsta killa, about my squilla for realla
Not ur average drug dealla, no love, I plug niggas
And I ain't askin for sympathy for any sentence they givin me
I be poppin (Yak and Pac?)my 5 and droppin niggas in the industry
Why I write it so fast, its engraved in my head
Please go with me lord, I got a grave in my bed
Apoligies to my mama, she ain't rased me crazy
Tell the babies I ain't mad but the stage is ???
Maybe its true the weed had some of my mind freeze
Trying to raise Young D and running behind e's
You dont really wanna be infront of my blind e
Clock stoppers, killin Glock, nigga ur time will freeze

[Chorus: Hussein Fatal](x2)
Death b4 dishonor, Ill never worry
Eyes blurried saying goodbye at the cemitery
And I'm squeezing on this trigger with hate
Till I'm free and all these niggas relate

[Outro]
Death b4 dishonor, Ill never worry
Eyes blurried saying goodbye at the cemitery
And I'm squeezing on this trigger with hate
Till I'm free and all these niggas relate
