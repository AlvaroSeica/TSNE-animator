[Spice 1]
Coolin' on the corner with the cellular phone
You could tell that the East Bay was his home
More mail than the rest of the pushers
Cause he got a Tec-9 in the bushes
(*gun shots*, bushes, bushes, bushes, bushes...)
And that's how his shit was handled
First name Jack, last name Daniels
Had two boys named E and Jay
E had the Nine and Jay the A.K.
Clocked on a street called Hennessy
robbers with the motherfucker name Old E. (E, E, E)
E had a bitch and her name was Gin
Had a nigga named Juice doin' time in the pen
You couldn't tell that Gin was a bitch though
Cause she was fuckin' some nigga named Cisco
(Cisco, Cisco, Cisco, Cisco...)
E and Jay knew tonight they'd come
With two fat niggas named Bacardi and Rum
They capped Jack's hoe (*gun shot*) and the sight was scary
The bitch was all Bloody and her name was Mary
Officer Martini wiped up the body
And all fingers pointed at Rum and Bacardi
E and Jay told Jack the hoe tell
So Jack tried to bail Juice out the jail
But Old E. had the Judge on a payroll clout
So Jack shot the Judge up and broke Juice out (*gun shots*)
Now everybody's talkin' 'bout Gin and Juice (Juice, Juice...)
Juice shot Gin cause the bitch was loose
Now E is shook thinkin' they ain't gonna get me
I'll round up the posse and call up Mickey (*phone rings*)
Mickey was big, he only sold eight-balls
Had ninety-nine niggas up against the wall
E and Jay found out he made the call
So E and Jay and Jack and Juice nined them all (*gun shots*)
They were sent to the morgue and Mickey paid the bill
Got the money from the bitch went to Strawberry Hill
Jack and Juice said Mickey wouldn't survive
But Mickey was slick he had a Colt .45
And now he's wonderin' how he got the word
Ot was the neighborhood wino Thunderbird (bird, bird, bird, bird...)
You wonder how the murder rap got so much juice
It was a hundred and eighty-seven proof
Check it out!
(check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it...)

Mickey sent St. Ides after Thunderbird
Time for the Hurricane, E said word
Thunderbird in an alley-way wearin' a beanie
Tryin' to get a sip from the cop Mr. Martini
St. Ides screwed off Thunderbird's top
Spilled his drink and gave a swig to the cop
But it's too late Martini knows it all
Mickey and his boy Old D were slangin' eight balls (ball, ball, ball...)
of cocaine to the strawberries on the hill
So when he asked for Juice he got a quick fill
Mickey had his boy on Bourbon blocks
The murderous cop killer Mr. Peppermint Schnapps
Mickey had this thing about nosey cops
and it made Mr. Peppermint lose his top (top, top, top, top...)
Martini off duty waitin' for the Night Train
Didn't know his wife Champagne would ever see him again
Peppermint Schnapps creepin' with the Colt .45
Gotta peel his cap 'fore the train arrives
Gotta stay low in Broward here comes the train
All the boys said the engineers Bartles and Jaymes
There was a toot from the train and then a gun blast
Martini fell on the ground there was a big splash
Mr. Schnapps got up because the cops chased him
St. Ides and Mickey in a 'vette ready in front of the station (station, station)
But you know Jack and Juice was undercover
and Jack was mad because Mickey shot his lover
There was big shoot-out and Mickey got juiced
He couldn't hang with the one-eighty-seven proof
Juice is splattered and St. Ides had took a fall
and then Endo smoked 'em all
Check it out!
