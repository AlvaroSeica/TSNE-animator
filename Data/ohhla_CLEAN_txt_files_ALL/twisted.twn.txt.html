cuz I got a little money, can't see it for 
the likes of my eyes. (2X) 

Chorus 

1st Verse: 
Damn! Can't even get out the door good, 
she's on my line hittin' me on my hip at least 
about five to six times. Tryin' find a way to 
slide in to my busy schedule she say and what's 
up for the day but um, being the player that I 
am I keep my game face on, paper's not long 
it's mandle my hustle's strong, so it's off to 
scoopski got a G, got a homie that'll give us that 
love on the quota-P, but when the mission is 
complete the baby week and see if it's really 
all good like you say, don't play with me. Got me 
fucked with the wrong dick and the wrong clit, 
crossin' my path and no doubt will get that ass 
kicked, still on a mission therefore I gotta have it 
trick nothin' but yourself the sucka's at the store 
on the shell schemin' for the wealth that you know 
is on the way but back on up, I'm not the payer, I gets 
paid. 

Chorus 

2nd Verse: 
Back in the days it was you that wouldn't speak, 
now you breakin' your neck to see what's up for 
the week, you should have been down, that's on 
the real right from the jump, but now I got to treat you 
like a toss-up who's caught up. You got some nerve 
to be actin' like it's all good, I see your phony side as 
I slide through the neighborhood. Miss Goody-Good 
I wish you would think would get some love from this way, 
you better keep away. Man, didn't they know that they 
eyes are the window to they soul, you dirty-low-down 
ice water cold, person that I used to see, eating my 
dust as I mash, it's all about the family makin' cash. 
Non-stop for us got that business deal to work, sign 
some autographs give away a grip of shirts. 
I know it hurts to see a nigga doin' his thang, you 
shoulda' maintained the road to fame, now you get 
a X by your name. 

Chorus 

3rd Verse: 
Now, what makes you think that you can play some 
real playa's play, nights on the phone with your girl 
truth or dare? (Truth). You was gobblin' up a gang 
of shit on the down low, mister phisticated top rated 
gettin' headphones. Now it's on and I lay back 
watch'em jock, go up and down the block, 
(where the homies?) on the spot servin' berry, cuz 
Mary ever get you like high, why try when I, brutalize 
our spys. Now lately I been hangin', just thinkin' bout' 
my knot, should my hammer just go pop on them 
suckas that don't stop. Yakkin' at the mouth 
buckmouth jaw jackin', I'm seein' through the makeup 
undercover hood flatten. I'm after, the dollas and 
the cents you gon need to realize the drama that the 
twinz bring indeed. Proceed to make you jump, 
got a whole of spunk, mama didn't raise no punk gettin' 
all up in funk. (what?)
