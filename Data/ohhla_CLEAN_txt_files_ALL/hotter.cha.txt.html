[Cha Cha]
Uh-huh ooh
Uh-huh ooh, ooh
Uh-huh ooh
Uh-huh ooh, ooh
You tell me who make it hotter than this
You tell me who get you high like this
You tell me if you're not convinced
You tell me a chick as live as this
You tell me who make it hotter than this
You tell me who get you high like this
You tell me if you're not convinced
You tell me a chick as live as this

[Cha Cha]
So many wonder why they roll with this
Spend dough with this
And even more why I'm the chosen chick
Some say its either the way the Rover whip
Or woman's showmanship
Or leather fit that can grow 'em in whips
See despite I'm calling it right
She ain't the ballerness type
Me and his ex ain't at all alike
I'm the type that can perform a dribble like a height
V-V-S precise
Cop the ice no regards to the price
So entice, give it all to the wife
Small won't suffice
Now they all want advice
Once or twice, must be nice
Carats all big as life
Why these broads wanna fight?
Cause my name's Cha Cha
Get it right, get it right
So respect game
And nigga accept change
Give it all up it's the best thing
Couple five hundred when the check came
Got the Land Rover in my ex's name
Now that's game 'ccept Bling can explain
No wedding ring get things he better bang
Better change, that old saying ain't the same
What a shame cause I game from the game I claim
Gonna refrain my gang grenade
My French flame try too plain
Give me half of what he make on the grain
Double the Franks
Like thanks just get it in US's change

[Cha Cha] (Yero)
You tell me who make it hotter than this
You tell me who get you high like this
You tell me if you're not convinced
You tell me a chick as live as this
You tell me who make it hotter than this
You tell me who get you high like this
You tell me if you're not convinced
You tell me a chick as live as this
You tell me who make it hotter than this
You tell me who get you high like this
(Tell me who make it hotter than me)
You tell me if you're not convinced
You tell me a chick as live as this
(Tell me who take control like me)
You tell me who make it hotter than this
You tell me who get you high like this
(Waiting on somebody to see)
You tell me if you're not convinced
You tell me a chick as live as this
(Then let go of me and set me free)

[Cha Cha]
I make a nigga wanna lie for this
Steal and die for this
Go upstate pushing the pie for this
You might see me in the Prada fit, rocks the size of fists
Intuitions say eighty-five for this
Eighteen with an eye for this, baby an optimist
But she be claiming that she toppin' this
I'm not convinced
Pop a lot of fists just cause we opposites
And I'm cop but they trying to hear from real shh
Straight misery what a broad bring y'all, to the industry
Don't try to fight it if it was meant to be
Taking over twenty first century
Ain't none of y'all really making hits to me
So witness me speed off in the fastest choice
Soon as you broads try to take off
Blow your face off, face-off
Miss Lyrical Cash Detroit, uh-uh
Assuming that you want that
Nine code and more with the toe tack
You see the baby got a squad taking Prozac
Open you niggas wide up when the chrome clap
Know that I'm what a nigga kill for
Steal for, gotta man and they still want
For real though, better tell them they don't feel low
There's a new broad in the dough and I feel for them

[Cha Cha] (Yero)
You tell me who make it hotter than this

You tell me who make it hotter than this

You tell me if you're not convinced
You tell me a chick as live as this
You tell me who make it hotter than this
You tell me who get you high like this
(Tell me who make it hotter than me)
You tell me if you're not convinced
You tell me a chick as live as this
(Tell me who take control like me)
You tell me who make it hotter than this
You tell me who get you high like this
(Waiting on somebody to see)
You tell me if you're not convinced
You tell me a chick as live as this
(Then let go of me and set me free)

[Cha Cha]
Only you and you
Determine what you can do
But if it's you to choose to make a nigga lose his cool
Would you do it? Would you do it? Would you do it?
Only you and you
Determine what you can do
But if it's you to choose to make a nigga lose his cool
Would you do it? Would you do it? Would you do it?
