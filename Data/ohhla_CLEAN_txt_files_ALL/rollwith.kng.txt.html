Song:   Roll With a Strap
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: Big Swiisha]
Why must I be like that
Why must I roll with a strap
Nothin' but the thug in me
Nothin' but the thug in me

[Verse 1]
Its the muthafucken hood life
You don't know
But I'm a show you
What the hood's like
It's the muthafucken royal blue
L.a. dodger cap
Got pride
Like eazy-e's compton hat
Everybody bow down
Like dr. dre's back
In the alley with my homies
Listening to payback
In the south side
All my homies post outside
This my hood
And I'm a show you I'm about mine
We put it down
If your hood wants war
Non-stop get blasted
In your hood once more
My homies keep it gangsta
That's why we're getting bigger
Fuck a red rag
Yeah everybody killa
I'm up in the oc
Cruising on bristol
Gang affiliated
So I brought my pistol
I will talk shit
Like fuck all of you
Taking off my shirt
Like what you wanna do homie?

[Chorus: Big Swiisha (x2)]

[Verse 2]
I'm a lil muthafucka
But I don't give a fuck
Try to act brave
Get blasted the fuck up
Never been afraid
12 gauge let it bust
Enemy gangs
We put lames in the trunk
I know you heard
The lapd don't like it
That's why the fbi
Got us indicted
Man, its just so hard to be a g
Oh yeah
Till the enemies fall
Fuck peace
We winning the war
Your boys keep on losing
South side riding
We keep on recruiting
Ride homicide
Till the wheels fall off
Your big homies got shot
So your hood got soft
What's crackin' bee gee?
From the smiley drive gangstas
Much love swifty
Centro side bangin'
I gotta keep it real
Thats the only way to be
Royal blue bandana
Yeah thats me

[Chorus: Big Swiisha (x2)]

[Verse 3]
I'm an l.a. gangsta, bitch
I bang blue
Only recruit soldiers
Just never you lame fools
See it on the news
2 enemies dead
Got caught in the street
Wearing all red
Your body full of lead
Cops got no witness
A man in all black
But they don't have my description
Loaded, cock it
Shoot his fucken ass
Run dash
Piss on my hands
Never snitch
Never tell
For my homies up in jail
Try to get you out on bail
Homie I'm a lunatic
L.a. where we don't like strangers
We don't like snitches
And we don't like rapists
Southern c.a
The home of real gangstas
Shaggy from the drive
Chillin' up in vegas
I never trust a man
Cause only god could save us
We live &amp; we die in l.a
Nothin' could change us

[Chorus: Big Swiisha (x2)]</pre>
