[Chorus: Apocalipps]
What would you do?
When the corn try to play you on the song
But in real life, he don't really wanna get it on
What would you do?
Stay calm, I got the two-two long
This nigga way out of his league, one shot then he gone
What would you do?
Jealousy is a muthafucka, boy
But you paying no attention, cuz you gotta move on
What would you do?
It's only right, that I come with the bomb and
Hand it to your moms, cuz the streets wanna respond

[Iron Mic]
All you indy copied thugs, turn your batteries off
You don't wanna battle me, I guarantee you a loss
Face casualty, we rapidly, flaming the torch
Fuck the happy songs, I write my shit hard to the core
Iron Mic ain't no battle rapper (what you are?)
I'm a Ruthless Bastard, I run up on you and clap ya
Usely when it's drama, we bringing heat to the niggas
But he don't want it, so we just gon' eat to the nigga
And like I said, we don't the hammer, for what
Illiterate rap nigga, I'm gon' teach ya some grammar
Watch what comes out ya mouth, we gon' teach ya some manners
I know how to fight, but I'm quick to cut, scoop me, and slam ya
And any other nigga would of dead, so just cuz you still living
Muthafucka, don't let it go to ya head
You don't want drama, you don't don't wanna go to the lead
You'd rather, get on tracks and make 'em lodge instead
And nope, I'm not gonna speak your name, and not cuz I'm scared, nigga
It's cuz I rarely speak on lames
But I'mma tell ya mines, it's Iron, nigga
You will never be Ruthless, stop trying nigga

[Chorus]

[Beno]
Hurry to get to cutting, my gun get to bucking
I'm always into something, even when I'm into nothing
They don't want no beef, they wanna eat they teeth
They wanna keep it peace, niggas see us in the streets
I'm in the booth, no vest, no gun
But when I'm vexed, son, I suggest you run
Lesson one, niggas don't fuck with Beno
Lesson two, still don't wanna fuck with Beno
Cuz I stomp niggas out like Joe Pesci in Casino
You can catch me out arena, put the pressure out on 'dino
I'm bad, but I ain't no Michael Jackson
But the mack I'm clapping, nigga, have you gasping

[Truck]
Yo, I dare this nigga say my name, they gon' find ya little
Clown ass chopped up, back of the range
I got a up north, hunt rifle, use it for range
You try to pop off, I use this to knock off lames
I would of got at you sooner, Lipps told me don't spaz out
Cuz you the type to get drunk, talk shit, passed out
Stop lying in you rhymes, nigga, spit the true facts out
How we thrash MC's who bring the macks out
Brought them cameras and them tapes to the hood
And all you bitch ass ever did was just hate in the hood
We shitting on you, when your peoples just bopping they head
I signed to a record label that'll pop off ya head
It's Truck, and I'mma rhyme until my casket dumping
Ruthless Bastarz and we smashing pumpkins

[Chorus]

[Apocalipps]
When you trying to bring the ring back home
And faggot niggas throwing eggs at the throne
Stupid, yea, bitch, I'm back in ya ass
Black burner on my waist, use it to back up ya staff
And ya'll niggas is starving, but coming at Lipps
Is not the answer, I eat ya insides up like cancer
The first time I let you slide, you made a little bit of money
Off my name, with them lies
The Bastardz was gon' clap at your house
Instead I'mma, stomp out ya tongue and sow it back to ya mouth
You'se a clown ass nigga, get off my dick
You'se a stan, matter fact, yo, you worse than my bitch
But you know my gun'll flip a bird, wordplay
Flip a verb, straight flip on a nigga, and pick a herb
I'mma use you as a fucking example, and kill you
Ya family, and them niggas that claims ya samples
And duke who made ya beats, I'm smacking them up
And press them lames that's pressing all that wack shit up
I'm a leader, you a follower, I bang for New York
And we can get it on in broad day like Gangs of New York
Your ice grill costume is hot, but I ain't scared
You forgot, Halloween is one day of the year
Wack ass raps sounding like a broken language
I'mma break up them broke ass niggas you hang with
Your manager must of gassed you up, he wanna see me blast you up
And you hang with that faggot fuck
Don't ever try to play me on wax, I pop off the lead
Pop Ya Head Off Records, nigga, pop off your head
Apocalipps, you see me when you sleep, and inspired
All ya little niggas, to get them CD's with the beats
This is Ramadan, muthafucka, ya'll can't eat
And you can't be a whore, cuz you trick and you treat
You'd ride anybody dick just to be on they team
You restricted, don't ever scream 418, bitch</pre>
