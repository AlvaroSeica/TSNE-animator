[Intro: Marc Live]
Yeah... OH!, let's go...
L.A. (Crensh!)
New York, Chicago

[Chorus]
Yo let me show 'em
What we got, when we come, yo it's serious
It's crazy, bananas, it's delirious
Don't come at us, this is gigantic
Martin Scorsese - gangsta, titanic

[Jacky Jasper]
I murder with the click, then I dip
'Matic off the hip - I'm sooo sick
Lay yo' ass on the floor, spread out
I'm a grown man with cheese, fuckin' fake out
Chron, fuckin' line, quit tryin'
Spawn, today you die, no replyin'
From your folks, your boy's a joke, we spoke
Were's the papes, I got the coach
Fresh, don't guess
Got yo' mom's address
Must confess, no rude boy I test
Do this simple, I'm Simon Temple
Creep through your window, put a bullet in your temple
No eyewitnesses, who it was?
You snitch to the fuzz - that's what he does
Cause, he wasn't cut right, don't like the Judis type
I'm takin' your life

[Chorus]
Yo let me show 'em
What we got, when we come, yo it's serious
It's crazy, bananas, it's delirious
Don't come at us, this is gigantic
Martin Scorsese - gangsta, titanic
Yo let me show 'em
What we got, when we come, yo it's serious
It's crazy, bananas, it's delirious
Don't come at us, this is gigantic, gangsta, titanic

[Kool Keith]
New York got nothin' for me to hear, nothin' from me
Y'all wack, grab me a beer
Brooklyn Bridge from the Bronx
George Washington - watch it son, the kid cock it son
You should quit what you doin', quit who you screwin'
Everything out there is freezed up from the ass up
I'm Frankenstein Jr.
You fess up, y'all dress up in your entourage
Step off with soft mittens
Your corny action figures are old - nothin' newman
Your best raps need to be backed up
Construction worker, here - everything's packed up
Keyboards is weak soft
Y'all stop tryin' to build racks up
I chop up studio time, rectum I wax up
Booty split, I blow cracks up
Y'all play hopscotch, pick balls and jacks up
No gun play, I chop like meat
Meat markets bring the bodies and ax up
Blood on the window sill
Motherfucker pours in a plastic cup
People in the basement wantin' my services
Are you askin' or what?
Nothin' beats, everything is ass and butt
I'ma stand right behind your favorite man, and see what he cut
Tight panties, I'ma see what he strut
If his girl's bustin' off I'ma see if she nut

[Chorus]
Yo let me show 'em
What we got, when we come, yo it's serious
It's crazy, bananas, it's delirious
Don't come at us, this is gigantic
Martin Scorsese - gangsta, titanic
Yo let me show 'em
What we got, when we come, yo it's serious
It's crazy, bananas, it's delirious
Don't come at us, this is gigantic, gangsta, titanic

[Marc Live]
It's scary how we - creep through the fog and creep through the smog
Sleep on you all - I don't care about you
My snare will stop you (uhh!), your whole album
Everything we works, you pull up your skirt too
Bullets will hurt you
I don't like you or - what you do
Your life is through (c'mon)
Listen, I gotta kill New York, I gotta hurt L.A.
Everything in the middle, follow the fiddle
It's so big you could stack fifty Peterbilts
And 747's, a skyscraper (yeah!)
Eh yo, a football stadium
Main attraction, jock me later (let's go)
I got my windows down, stick around dunn
I like the chrome and them springs on them shiny guns
Collect a check, ugly, I'm the slimy one
Eject your set, operation terrible

[Chorus]
Yo let me show 'em
What we got, when we come, yo it's serious
It's crazy, bananas, it's delirious
Don't come at us, this is gigantic
Martin Scorsese - gangsta, titanic
Yo let me show you
What we got, when we come, yo it's serious
It's crazy, bananas, it's delirious
Don't come at us, this is gigantic, gangsta, titanic...

WOO!</pre>
