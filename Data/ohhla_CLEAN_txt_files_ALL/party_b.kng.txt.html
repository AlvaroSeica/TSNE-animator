Homey, goodness, God

You know what I'm saying?

[Sharecka]
Can't handle these melodies, can't write none of this, man
Pen and paper-ass niggaz, you turn it
Now I have to tell when I sit I burn it
Yeah, y'all know when I rock this shit, I'm coming and coming
Can't stop me, every time I do it, I murder it
And kids, y'all need to take a break
Matter of fact, you leaning, muthafucka, take a V8
See this cat here, yeah cat, I don't write
I just get up on the microphone and just recite
That hot shit, you be loving
Take it back to yo' house, muthafucka, and you dub it
Yeah, drop units, don't even bother
And ya CD be Free like AJ partner
Nicer than I? Beg ya pardon?
Yo, ain't you the same cat I seen working valet parking?
Them niggaz murdering nothing but roaches in they house
In they living room, a love seat, calling it a couch
And that shit you delivering, man
It won't get you a deal, but you could be a delivery man
Did you bring my cheese cake? You ain't Making the Band
Sperm cells on yo' knuckles, I ain't shaking ya hand
Matter of fact, where my belt at? I'm spanking ya ass
You done shitted on yaself, where ya Pamper bag?
You humiliating me? Then y'all stand for that
When you standing there with clothes from a hamper bag
This ain't even bomb shit, this is all my trash
Y'all niggaz, y'all could kiss my ass, B.K., come on

[Interlude: Timbo King w/ Sharecka chanting "Bo" constantly]

But ya girl want my love and I'm wondering how
