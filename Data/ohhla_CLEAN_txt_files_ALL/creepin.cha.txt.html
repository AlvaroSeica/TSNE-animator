Venom!
 
(Chorus - Chamillionaire)
In the streets I'm peepin'game, I can't trust you no mo'
all up in my business mayne, I stay on the low - low
say they really, really fake - can't mess with you no mo'
closes people to you hate - so I be rollin'solo
I'm creepin on the low, creepin on the low - low
I be rollin, I be rollin solo
I'm creepin on the low, creepin on the low - low
I be rollin, I be rollin solo - I'm creepin on the low
 
[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire]
Mo'money and mo'problems what Biggie said it looks like it's true
used to be my homeboys, but now I'm paid so they tryna sue
my garage got Jaguars, my garage look like a zoo
middle finger up for the haters, hope the hater here isn't you
I'm super cool, that's real cool - you can feel like you got a friend
but I ain't trustin'my money counter, and that's the reason I count again
you saw the force I'm suspicious, thinkin everybody wanna take my riches
can't take my money out my account - cause my bankteller get motion sickness
back in forth - back, back in forth - I'm in the streets and right back in court
candy car built like a tank and my crib built like a fort
let's go to war, I ain't George Bush - I promise ya'll I'm gon'be prepared
cause I ain't trustin my weapon either, and that's the reason I keep a spare(Yeah)
 
[Chorus - Chamillionaire]
In the streets I'm peepin' game, I can't trust you no mo'
all up in my business mayne, I stay on the low - low
say they really, really fake - can't mess with you no mo'
closes people to you hate - so I be rollin'solo
I'm creepin on the low, creepin on the low - low
I be rollin, I be rollin solo
I'm creepin on the low, creepin on the low - low
I be rollin, I be rollin solo - I'm creepin on the low
 
[Verse 2 - Chamillionaire]
I ain't hangin'with none of ya'll 'Outkast'like 3 - Thou
win the grammy, thank God and family and all of ya'll I'm gon'leave out
you don't like it then peace out, look around and I see doubt
I been known to get to the presidents, like Barack was on speed dial
Yeah it's all about me now - don't want ya, and don't need ya
you don't grind and get to the money and you ain't hungry I want feed ya
I ain't hangin with no hater, no faker, no diva
do it big, and they say they did - and try to take my credit like stole Visa
(If it's lonely at the top, I'd rather be alone)
(cause the closes people to ya, the ones who gonna do you wrong)
backstabbin'me for a broad, promise I want lose no sleep
cause Jenny Craig can be yo'freak - but my bank account gon'stay obese
 
[Chorus - Chamillionaire]
In the streets I'm peepin'game, I can't trust you no mo'
all up in my business mayne, I stay on the low - low
say they really, really fake - can't mess with you no mo'
closes people to you hate - so I be rollin'solo
I'm creepin on the low, creepin on the low - low
I be rollin, I be rollin solo
I'm creepin on the low, creepin on the low - low
I be rollin, I be rollin solo - I'm creepin on the low
 
[Verse 3 - Ludacris]
I be creepin lower, then low
light another blunt, and I'm smokin the dro
chokin' - loccin'never provokin
but the trunk'll get popped and I'll open the do'
blunts full of smoke - I be slower then slow
feel like I'm chopped and it's no where to go
so I just pull out the bazooka(BLOAH)put a fuckin hole in the flo'
Luda! I'm so dope with the flow
trunk full of speakers, pocket full of dubs
how much wood could a wood, chuck - chuck if a wood chuck could chuck wood grain
grippin on the wheel - turn it, turn it
blow another sack - I earned it, earned it
blow another amp - pull another tramp
light another blunt - burn it, burn it
flame it up, here my flow I changed it up
everybody grab yo gats and hold 'em, load 'em, sock 'em, lock 'em, cock 'em and aim it up
bang it up, off in the sky - catch me rollin off in the ride
twenty six inches, leave 'em defenseless - forty five always cut to the side
open ya eyes see me crusin'cause I keep winnin'and these boys keep losin'
plus I'm the pimp of the year, playas is hatin and hoes is chosin'
look at all the hoes you losin'then look it all the game I got
and you can catch me creepin on the low - low, Luda ridin solo - beatin the block
