[Lil Waah] + (Swizz Beatz)
Uh-huh, Double R
Lil Waah (sh-sh-showtime!)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey I do what I do, I shine how I shine
Ay Swizz, tell 'em again baby (showtime, showtime, showtime!)
Tell 'em it's (showtime, showtime, showtime!)
Tell 'em it's (showtime, showtime!)
Hey I do what I do, I shine how I shine
Ay Swizz, tell 'em again baby (sh-sh-showtime!)

Everything cool like the weather 'bout to break
Said it's over for the R, must be a big mistake
Shake like a earthquake, we rowdy, rowdy
Quicker picker-upper like we talkin, +Bounty+
Bounce like I'm older then our label on my shoulder
When I grab the microphone like this, tell 'em Swizz
(Showtime, showtime!) I hear it, it's yo' time
Any rapper want it with me can go line for line
I'm fine, great, baby don't hate
We eatin over here, you need to come and get a plate
Pick a state, any state, I been known to shine
Aiyyo Swizz, tell 'em again baby (showtime, showtime!)

Tell 'em it's (sh-showtime, showtime!)
Tell 'em it's (sh-showtime!)
I do what I do, I shine how I shine
Ay Swizz, tell 'em again baby (sh-sh-showtime!)
When the lights come on that's when I start to perform
Ruff Ryders baby, you know that we get it on
I do what I do, I shine how I shine (showtime!)
Ay Swizz, tell 'em again baby (sh-sh-showtime!)

Swizz got the sneakers and a new custom car
The next generation, the new Double R
So fly I don't think you wanna get up outta line
At the drop of a dime make a beat go time (showtime!)
Baby girl I think you're cute, you're cute
All I do is get the loot, get the loot
Match-match-match-match-match my hat out with the boot, my boot
Like a owl cause I don't give a hoot, hoot
It's real in the field, for real the game mine
Yo Swizz, tell 'em again baby (sh-sh-showtime!)
I do what I do, shine like I shine
Ay, tell 'em one mo' time baby (sh-sh-showtime!)

(Showtime!) Tell 'em it's (sh-showtime!)
(Showtime!) Tell 'em it's (sh-showtime!)
I do what I do, I shine how I shine
Ay Swizz, tell 'em again baby (sh-sh-showtime!)
When the lights come on that's when I start to perform
Ruff Ryders baby, you know that we get it on
I do what I do (showtime!) I shine how I shine (sh-showtime!)
Ay Swizz (showtime!) tell 'em again baby (sh-sh-showtime!)

I got my own cars and plane, everything insane
Quino is my name, you should quit the game
I'm young but I'm hot, you mad cause you not
It's showtime baby when I rhyme in the spot
Fans I got a lot, shorty watch me on the internet
I been a threat, and you ain't even in it yet
Why sweat? The game is all mine
My team is on time, my flow is in line

(Showtime!) Tell 'em it's (showtime!)
(Showtime! Sh-sh-showtime!)
(Showtime!) Tell 'em it's (showtime!)
(Showtime! Sh-sh-showtime!)
(Showtime!) Tell 'em it's (showtime!)
(Showtime!) Tell 'em it's (showtime!)
I do what I do, I shine how I shine
Ay Swizz, tell 'em again baby (showtime!)
When the lights come on that's when I start to perform (showtime!)
Ruff Ryders baby, you know that we get it on (showtime!)
I do what I do (showtime!) I shine how I shine (sh-showtime!)
Ay Swizz (showtime!) tell 'em again baby (sh-sh-showtime!)
