I'll call my buddy up, he be coming through with tha herb
I need some chronic smoke, give me an o and a couple of points
your good business, I'll leave you with a couple of joints
your good business, each nugget is double in moist
wait up what is this, weigh it out I need digits
I'm always paranoid thinking that somebody pinched it
I gotta habit now, can't walk around without a spliff lit
blunts are dumbbells, my couch and bed are weight benches
I keep my brights on driving through the cotton clouds
if I was driving I swear to god the top would be down
if I was rhyming, nobody could fuck with me now
straight free stylin', too high to be writing it down
if I was on stage holding down the sight and the sound
you see what I'm on, you wanna hit, you liking it now
I'll call my buddy up, he be coming through with tha herb
I need some chronic smoke, give me an o and a couple of points
now where I'm from, the seedy shake you smoke is shitty
I got the bomb bud, hit me up I'll pump your city???
you hook the clientele, I'll drop forty, and keep sixty
I'll keep supplying it, just make sure them niggas ain't shifty
alert your king pin, tell that nigga he can't get with me
and let him sample it, don't shut down a twinkie sticky
I don't know man, he hugs the block its way too risky
well look you handle it, well ante up the 50/50

I'll call my buddy up, he be coming through with tha herb
I need some chronic smoke, give me an o, send it by birds

ill cop the hideaway, to live in peace its up in the burbs
I keep my end of the street, if anything moves I get heard
I deal with dime sacks, doolies, quads and ozones
p's, qp's, so on and so on
hit up my cell phone, I'm well known but I have no friends
it's like something comes between us when the bag opens
I get this prima donna complex when the cash flows in
and every minute that you lack I put a penny in your bag homie
they say you got a better hook with better bud, show me
I gotta jacket with a badge on it, you don't really know me

I got connections, gorilla pro nigga's only
I need protection, it's nothing but a word homie

I'll call my buddy up, he be coming through with tha herb,
I need some chronic smoke, give me an o, send it by birds (x2)

what you know about that breakdown, distribute shit
that mutha fucka put it in the trunk to lift the shit
I'm on the scene, I got grasshopper green, aqua boogie with the lightest touch of
citrus on its leaves
hit me up, a hit of this be putting bitches on their knees
hit me up, funkdafied freddy limping with a crease
I got some product out in europe
with some niggas over seas
ON A WORLDWIDE MISSION WITH THEM NIGGAS FROM THE B'S BRICK NINE</pre>
