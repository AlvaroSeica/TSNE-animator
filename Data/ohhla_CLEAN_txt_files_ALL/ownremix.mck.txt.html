[Intro: Rick Ross] (Maybach Music Sample)
Mastermind! Ricky Rozay! Double M!  (Maybach Music!) I got it!
I got you homey! Uh!

[Verse One: Rick Ross]
On the corner I'm followed like I'm in Barney's
A belt like a brick now these people all on me
Haters wanna harm me (HUH!) Navy and the Army (WOO!)
Split your six bitch Fitch Abercrombie
D boy cheddar, kin so leather
Maybach Music, Rolls Royce weather (WOO!)
She my dream girl, my Faith Evans
Shotgun, in my new seven
Standin in the rain screamin put the kid on (WHAT!) 
Throw the peace sign prayin that you live long (HUH!)
Beard long like the Nation Of Islam
Income that'll make ends and get some
(WOO!) Residuals is what a nigga live for
(WOO!) Ridicule I never had a feel for
(WOO!) The realtor said I was a real boy
Hard cash then the fat boy peeled off
Chrome wheel speedin down the dirt road (HUH!)
Mastermind all white minks on (WOO!)
Uh! Minks on! Rozay hold 'em up let's go!

[Verse Two: Mack Wilds]
Nothing's too much, words that I live by, and that's just how I do, do, I do
I'm young right now, but I won't be forever
So I'm a live it up like that's true, you might wanna roll with me too
Said I don't mean to brag, but I live a life that most can only dream about, yeah
So baby come be my dream girl, pick a fantasy and let me work it out, yeah, oh yeah

[Chorus: Mack Wilds]
Tell me where you wanna go, what you wanna do
Said we livin it like we own it! own it! own it!
Said I'm on top of the world, what I need is you
Said we livin it like we own it! own it! own it! Yeah!

[Verse Three: Mack Wilds]
Said it's never too much, so just let the drinks flow
Later on you can come through, through, come through
You know you're the flyest, they should call you your highness
And call me king 'cause I'm that dude, and all you gotta do is leave your crew
Said I don't mean to brag, but I live a life that most can only dream about, yeah
So baby come be my dream girl, pick a fantasy and let me work it out, yeah, oh yeah

[Chorus: Mack Wilds]
Tell me where you wanna go, what you wanna do
Said we livin it like we own it! own it! own it!
Said I'm on top of the world, what I need is you
Said we livin it like we own it! own it! own it! Yeah!

[Bridge: Mack Wilds]
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!! Ahhhhh!!!!

[Chorus: Mack Wilds]
Tell me where you wanna go, what you wanna do
