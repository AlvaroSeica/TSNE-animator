See youngin be doin thangs that all the hoes like

See me I'm from BR buht I chill in Atlanta

[Verse 1]
? Ralph Lauren till my click get right
It's Forever 21 until my bitch get right
See youngin be doin thangs that all the hoes like
Club beats gon bang so all my shows hype
Tell tha DJ run it back kuz I wan' hear it one mo' 'gain
And I'm jumpin to tha ceiling off Rousseau not Gin
True Religion jeans got a nigga feelin comfortable
I spot a dumb fine hoe and she stupid re-tun-to
I be up in shakers with a pocket fulla faces
Spillin liquor on women and they be half naked
They tryna leave with me, I see it in they faces
Magnum gold packs yungin got em by the cases
I be goin ham like gawtdam up in Lenox mall
You try a couple of girls, I'm tryna rent em all
Mi niggas hollin "we some dogs we'a set it off"
Splat that nigga watermelon, put his picture on the wall

[Chorus]
Check out my pic, check out my click
Ohh we be dumb throwed
She with a click of bad bitches
They get dumb throwed
Check out my pic, check out my click
Ohh we be dumb throwed
She with a click of bad bitches
They get dumb throwed
Oh I be dumb throweeed
Stupid re-tun-to
Oh they get dumb throweed
Stupid re-tun-to
Oh I be dumb throweeed
Stupid re-tun-to
Oh they get dumb throweed
Stupid re-tun-to

[Verse 2]
Oh I be dumb throwed, and you already know this
When I hit tha stage they be like youngin ?
Rollin rollin rollin, I been doin it fa 4 days
Bet' not tell me nothin muthafucka you ont know me
Play me like a pussy I'm a be in central bookin
Lil mama steady look she must wan' gimme some pussy
Lamborghini youngin, they think I'm a grown man
20 grand in my pants, catch me doin my lil dance
Like right... to left, gon stunt like you exclusive
See me I do it real big I'm dumb and exclusive
Yea, now take me to the picture booth
I'm amped fulla pills, ya'll on that Grey Goose
Ya'll stuck lookin stupid, my click we steady movin
Ya'll still in that Coogi I'm retarted in this Gucci
I be polo down, call me polo rocka
Polo shoes, socks, and boxers

[Chorus]
Check out my pic, check out my click
Ohh we be dumb throwed
She with a click of bad bitches
They get dumb throwed
Check out my pic, check out my click
Ohh we be dumb throwed
