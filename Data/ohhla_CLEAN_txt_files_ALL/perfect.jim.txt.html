[Chorus: Jim Jones]
And I've been runnin in the streets all day
And I've been lookin at the stars all night
It got me thinkin how can I get away
It got me thinkin 'bout a perfect day
And I could tell you somethin we both know
We can hustle but the streets get cold
And I've been thinkin how can I get away
It got me thinkin 'bout a perfect day
She got the babysitter watchin the kids
She gettin sexy in here all day
She gonna party all her troubles away
She must be thinkin 'bout a perfect day

[Bridge: Logic]
We could be anywhere in the World
But we right here, we 'gon be right here
For this perfect day, got me thinking 'bout a perfect day

[Verse One: Jim Jones]
My perfect day, no work today
Got me thinkin 'bout the breeze when the sun get hot
On a water surface play
Nah no turf today, told my man throw his work away
I got a fool proof plan, make a couple of mill
And I think it's gonna work today

[Chorus: Jim Jones]
And I could tell you somethin we both know
We can hustle but the streets get cold
And I've been thinkin how can I get away
It got me thinkin 'bout a perfect day
She got the babysitter watchin the kids
She gettin sexy in here all day
She gonna party all her troubles away
She must be thinkin 'bout a perfect day

[Bridge: Logic]
We could be anywhere in the World
But we right here, we 'gon be right here
For this perfect day, got me thinking 'bout a perfect day

[Verse Two: Chink Santana]
No gunshots no caskets, no sirens flashin
No V's no police, no handcuffs no rips no lashes
We drunk no crashes, twist it up no passes
No sticks no skins no seeds we blowin the finest grasses

[Chorus: Jim Jones]
And I've been runnin in the streets all day
And I've been lookin at the stars all night
It got me thinkin how can I get away
It got me thinkin 'bout a perfect day
And I could tell you somethin we both know
We can hustle but the streets get cold
And I've been thinkin how can I get away
It got me thinkin 'bout a perfect day
She got the babysitter watchin the kids
She gettin sexy in here all day
She gonna party all her troubles away
She must be thinkin 'bout a perfect day </pre>
