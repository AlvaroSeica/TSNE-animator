[Intro: Rick Ross]
Masterminds
{M-M-M-M...} We gon' get this forever
You know whenever we link up, my nigga
They think this shit come from outer space or somethin
(Hahaha!) Nigga, let's get this money, nigga!
Woo! WOOOOOOOOOOO!! Masterminds
R-O-C, Double M-G, Jay I got it, I got it!

[Rick Ross]
Four stacks for the heels on my bitch feet
Car seat still smellin like ten ki's
Tell the plug that I'm lookin for an increase
Wingstop, fat boy'll need ten piece
Say a nigga name and the car start {*chirps*}
Nigga switchin lane to lane like Walmart
Sippin Bordeaux out in Bordeaux (whoa!)
Hazard lights flashin on the four-door (huh!)
Switch the Benzo for the Enzo
Back to Benzo when the ends low
Switch my old bitch for my new bitch
Cause my new bitch somethin like a nympho (woooo!)
Fuck the game raw when I came in it
Gettin money ever since I came in it
You couldn't stop me if you tried
Motherfucker, cause the devil is a lie!!

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
Big guns, big whips (huh!)
Rich nigga talkin big shit (huh!)
Double cup, gold wrist (woo!)
Double up on the blow, bitch!
Two mil on that 1-95
Bow your head cause it's time to pay tithes
Opposition want me dead or alive
Motherfucker, BUT THE DEVIL IS A LIE!!
The devil is a lie! Bitch, I'm the truth
The devil is a lie! (Lord..) Bitch, I'm the proof
The devil is a lie, the devil is a lie!
Bitch, I'm alive.. THE DEVIL IS A LIE~!!

[Rick Ross]
Two kings on the big screen (preach..)
Nigga seen a thirty-six at 16
Hundred K for the 16
Nigga stick dirty, but his dick clean
My money goin on the deep end
Talkin half a milli for the weekend
COntract like a nigga play defense
Curtains in the Maybach, bitch peek in!
(Woo!) Now the bitches wanna car hop
Six cribs for the cars in the car lot (got dat..)
Dope boys on the roll, nigga
Went gold six times for a goal, nigga (beyitch!)
Black bottle and a bad bitch
Club all money where the cash is
Dubai I can do it like a sheik!
Top floor nigga Burj KHALIF'!

[Chorus]

[Jay Z]
I got 'em, Ricky! Yah, yah, yah-yah...
Is it truth or it's fiction? Is it truth or it's fiction?
Is Hova atheist? I never fuck with +True Religion+
Am I down with the devil cause my roof come up missin
Is that Lucifer juice in that two cup he sippin
Naw, it's D'USSÃ‰ baby, welcome to the dark side (haha..)
Coulda got black list for the crack shit
White Jesus in my Crock-Pot
I mix the shit with some so-da
Now Black Jesus turned water to wine
And all I had to do was turn the stove up
East Coast, winnin that life, nigga
Cheat code, the hatin is flagrant, here's your free throws
The devil tried to hit me with the RICO, them black people
Devils want these niggaz hate they own kind
Gotta be the 'Luminati if a nigga shine
Or he can't be a nigga if a nigga rich
"Oh, he gotta be the devil" - that's some nigga shit
Ya seen what I did to the stop and frisk 
(Watch me..) Brooklyn on that Barney's like we own the bitch
(Watch me..) Give the money to the hood, now we all win
(Stop me..) Got that Barney's floor lookin like a V.I.M.
Black hoodie, black skully
Bravado like Mavado, boy I'm that gully
Gettin white money but I'm still black
All these niggaz claimin king but I'm still that
King Hova, Mansa Musa
Told my life, the devil is a lie, I'm the truth, ya!

[Chorus]

[Outro: Jay Z]
Church..
Hehe, Young
