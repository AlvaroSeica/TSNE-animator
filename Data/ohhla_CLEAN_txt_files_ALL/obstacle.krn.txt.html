(*talking*)
You can't say no weapon formed against you shall prosper
Then fold up when it get hard, let's go after it

[K-Rino]
Life was pretty rough, for a minute there
The status of your sanity, was in the air
Almost impossible, not to consume hate
When bad luck is living with ya, like a roommate
The clouds got dark, and start rumbling
The rain from the outside, was coming in
You trying not to panic but, that's the case
The water got higher, it was at your waist
It's hell now, but I ain't gots to tell you that
It's closing in on me, God where you at
You hurting for some bread, looking at the sun
That lil' nine to five, just ain't getting it done
Your partnas make your week's pay, in half a day
Promised your baby mama, not to get it that way
Life circumstances, make it kinda hard to trust
But always remember, God is a part of us

[Chorus - 2x]
We overcoming obstacles, and letting blessings in
I heard somebody say success, is the best revenge
If you utilize the talent, that was put in you
You can master everything, they said you couldn't do

[K-Rino]
See, all you wanna do is make the drama die
Your daddy never claimed you, and your mama's high
It's hard to trust people, you afraid of help
With no parents around, so you raised yourself
All your life, people shooting slugs at you
Everytime you take a step, they knock you back two
Your house was like hell, yeah days and months
Next door neighbors, living like the Brady Bunch
Wish you coulda went to school, and do something great
But sometimes you barely ate, and couldn't concentrate
You ain't nothing but a loser, that's what people said
You ain't evil but you hustling, for illegal bread
You resorted to the streets, and started getting love
Cause thugs, was the only folks who didn't judge
And even though, you might have one or two strikes
Deep in your heart, you know it's a greater purpose for your life

[Chorus - 2x]

[K-Rino]
You can't let your dreams shrivel up, and burst and die
Just because it didn't happen, on the first try
Or the second or the third, or the fourth time
Diamonds don't define greatness, let your heart shine
You keep running up, on these locked doors
Accept God's version of a blessing, not yours
We don't always know what's best, so trust in him because
You don't even know yourself, better than he does
Satan's cup is full of hate, so let the evil drink
You too grown to worry bout, what other people think
Spiritual war, try to make your higher conscience win
Even if the Devil do, get a few punches in
And we can heal, to the fullest soon
If we stop putting band-aids, on bullet wounds
Addressing problems from the root'll make you sober quick
And watch how strong you get, when it's over with

[Chorus - 2x]</pre>
