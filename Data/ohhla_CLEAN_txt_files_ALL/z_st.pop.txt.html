hey yo this theme wasn't a dream I'm dead ass no lean
it started with this chick who moved in thirteen
I started hearin a knock at four o clock am
started hearin a flock of high heels pop across the hall
I'm sayin 'yo what the fuck' through the peep hole
seen some people tippin the lab chicks I mean
badass kiko smack you off your ego
out to eat go but chill, here's the sequal
I mean here's the meet yo
takin out the garbage on the creep yo
the door opened up a voice said 'nice to greet you'
I played the low, noddin, half lookin in the room
til I seen what was cookin, ooh (oh, shit)
another chick rockin a bra
watchin tv holdin keys to a car, boom
now I'm definitely not lookin, yo I gotta loom
the chick at the door said their gonna party til noon
as the light from the moon hit the hall wall
she talked a little, wigglin her middle
gigglin like she had plans to fiddlin
focus not shooken
sayin she just moved up from from brooklyn (word?)
wasn't really tooken, wasn't really lookin
yeah, whatever, whatever, well
welcome to white planes, you stacked with a tight frame
wanna smash (errr) whiplash in the right lane
???? nice game
she laughed, asked me if I knew mike zane in fifteen
I was like 'ummm, not really, no'
'well, I know he's got that blow'
I was like 'oh'
took a picture of that body in my mind, yo
then it was time to go
cause I wasn't tryin to get caught up in the snow
picked up the trash bag, time to break yo
next morning woke up to a fuckin stage show
seven squad cars, DEA
three sheperds and snitches that sing like Stevie J
for that green, cause those chicks in thirteen
were undercover strain and busted mike zane
with twenty six ounces of pure cocaine

schemes are not always what they seem
in the maze these days there's many demons
to get you soul by any means</pre>
