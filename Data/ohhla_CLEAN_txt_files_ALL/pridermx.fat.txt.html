[Intro: Ashanti] (Trey Songz)
Yeah! Yeah! Oh! Yeaaahhhhh!!! (I don't know why, I tend to love these kind of girls)
Pride and joy, joy, joy (Ohhhhh Ooooh Ohhhh!!!!)
Why don't you steal my pride and joy, joy, and joy
But your still my pride and joy

[Chorus: Trey Songz] (Ashanti)
So, sophisti-cated, this young, lady
Got me goin, I don't know why, I tend to love these kind of girls
She's my, baby, It's so, crazy
I can't take it, but I love it, I swear I love her though
Even if she's all about the money I don't really care, yeah
Got alot of money it's enough of it that we could share
Oh I love these kind of girls (Why don't you steal my pride and joy)

[Verse One: Pusha T] (Ashanti)
Look at where the time went
Could never get back all the time spent (Joy, Joy, Joy)
Chase time, face time
Nowadays I don't even try and waste mine (Joy, Joy, and Joy)
Just rather drop a bag off
You see love is like a crash course (Joy, Joy, and Joy)
And I hate to be the bad sport
But there's one for every stamp in my passport 
So I'm still takin dimes out
And I'm still holdin tryouts (Joy, Joy and Joy)
Just never takin timeout
Scared of what I might find out

[Chorus: Trey Songz] (Ashanti)
So, sophisti-cated, this young, lady
Got me goin, I don't know why, I tend to love these kind of girls
She's my, baby, It's so, crazy
I can't take it, but I love it, I swear I love her though
Even if she's all about the money I don't really care, yeah
Got alot of money it's enough of it that we could share
Oh I love these kind of girls (Why don't you steal my pride and joy)

[Verse Two: Fat Joe] (Ashanti) (*Trey Songz)
Courtside any game, who the don?
Must be thinkin I'm a lame shit that you been on (Joy, Joy, and Joy)
I gave you rose, gold, everything
E'vrthing but a wedding ring (Joy, Joy, and Joy)
Now how you 'gon creep?
Got you that bubble gum six shit to shoot up the streets VROOM!!! (Joy, Joy, and Joy)
You say I'm fuckin well you fuckin right!
I heard you fuckin guess it's fuckin life (*I don't know why, I tend to love these kind of girls)
So quit denyin it 'cause niggas know
'Cause when you catch her still love her though (Joy, Joy, and Joy)
Ain't goin buy more designer clothes
So why you trippin you got finer hoes?!

[Chorus: Trey Songz] 
So, sophisti-cated, this young, lady
Got me goin, I don't know why, I tend to love these kind of girls

[Verse Three: Ashanti]
It ain't even that I'm all about the money babe
It be a diffence between the things, you do and say
I love you more than anything (Anything)
Boy I swear you gotta stop playin the games
Being your pride and your joy is cool
But I rather be your heart than to play a fool
'Cause my pride is everything I got
I be wrong if I give it up, just want another knot
Ohhhhhhhhh! Oh Oh Oh!!!
But you 'gon have to show me more, still my pride and joy
Because your still my pride and......joy!

[Chorus: Trey Songz] 
So, sophisti-cated, this young, lady
