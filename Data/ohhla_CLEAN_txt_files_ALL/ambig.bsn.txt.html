Song:   Ambiguous
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
She loves me, she loves me not
I can't tell if she's down or not
Oh you like me?
What the hell does that mean?
Don't be so ambiguous girl
Don't be so ambiguous girl
Are we gonna fuck or not?

[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
Maybe I'm just dumb
But I can't read the signals that you're giving
I can never tell
If you're looking at me or Clinton
Is this the way that you talk to every guy that you meet?
Or do you wanna come back and stay up all night, all night, all night with me?

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Baby what's your favorite drinks?
I think I'm about round of em all
I'm rollin up the bestest
Come help me blow a pound of it all
I'm on that up up extra line
You should climb up and be down with it all
Come here, cause we go hand and hand like round of applause
Showtime bitch, action
I think it's time for that night scene
She goes to sleep and dream about my sex
I guess it's her pipe dreams
28 but I'll make her feel like she 19
Trying to stick around like wifie
But I'll send her home in my white tee like bye, bye-bye, bye

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Clinton Sparks]
Now every time I see this girl
She be asking all type of shit
Where is it I'm going to?
And who is it I'm hanging with?
Can never tell if she's in to me
Or just want to be a friend to me
Mixed signals she sending me
Late night at the club drunk texting me
Like "can I come over your house? "
Ok but can I cum over your mouth
Smiley face, lol, back and forth
I can't tell without being conspicuous

[Chorus]</pre>
