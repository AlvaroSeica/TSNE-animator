Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Here's my story, it's sad but true
Yeah right
Yeah! You see I love women
But I can't pick just one
And like
I'm sure I'll settle down one day
But I'm young, right?
I'm just trying to have a good time
Living in the moment and what not
You could call me a dog
But everybody else calls me Chris Webby
Haha, naw mean?
Yeah, yeah

It's seems like every week
I get some girlie's number
In my phone
Bring her home
Make her scream
Make her yell
Make her moan
I'm a dog
Always looking for somewhere to put a bone
On my Entourage shit
Bitches looking like Sloane
I'm an animal
Off the chain
I had to cut loose
And judging on how you're dressed
You're tryin to fuck boo
You'll never hear me uttering about I love you
I just really want to see them panties
Dropping to your Ugg boots
It ain't my fault
Your girlfriend sweats me
She'll be getting back to you
Right after she's left me
And I ain't putting rose petals on your beadsheats
Romance ain't my thing
You should've known that when you met me
Am what I am
And I'll be it to my death
Got a thing for brunettes
With tats
And big breasts
So if you at the play
Don't worry
You'z on deck
Hate the game
Not the player, Ma
And then she make me say..

Whoa oh [repeated]

You see my life's good
Where it ought to be
All I gotta do is spit game
And slaughter beats
And I know you'll probably tell your whole sorority
Just don't expect my phone to answer
When you're calling me

I'm a son of a gun
Check my paternity test
Always chugging on a 40
And burning the best
Unzippering your jeans
While you kiss on my neck
Oh you're a good girl?
Psh, then it's on to the next

I like a bad chick
Just give her the chance
While I'm trying to figure out
How you fit in those pants
'Cause I'm partial to any exotic bittie
Looking like Mila Kunis in Forgetting Sarah Marshall

On the road every night
It's unique
So you right across the party
And I like what I see
Oh you're daddy's little girl?
Well tonight you a freak
She grab my hand
And brought me right upstairs
And then she make me say..

Whoa oh [repeated]
(Like we always do)
Now everybody now!
Whoa oh [repeated]</pre>
