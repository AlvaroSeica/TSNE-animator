[Intro - Nelly - talking]
Uh, uh, uh, yeah
Uh, uh, uh, uh (this is a Scott Storch production)
And the E-N-T is

[Chorus - Justin Timberlake] + (Nelly)
Baby show somethin (oh)
Don't say nothin (don't you say a word)
I just want to see you work it (c'mon baby work it for me, yeah)
That ain't frontin (naw)
Show me somethin
(oh, let me see it, let me see it, let me see it
let me see it, let me see it, let me see it, bend over let me see it)
I just want to see you work it

[Verse 1 - Nelly]
I heard her talkin loud, but she ain't sayin nothin
What up with all the frontin? Come on and show me somethin
You know you wanna do it, go 'head yo man ain't comin (please)
Do that thing, when you dippin, keep ya hips bumpin
What's up with all these questions and what you mad I'm famous
Baby girl, you talkin to me like you talkin to an adolescent
I need that - jump off, jump off
The clothes - come off, come off
The Hermaze, Apple B's, and the so on, so on (yeah)
Let your waist pop (pop), when the bass knock (knock)
Yeah, I flood the watch to the top until there's no clock (clock)
Can't even tell the time, but you know it's mine
What time is it ma?  It's twenty karats after nine
Are you dehydrated? Well let me quench your thirst
Check it, but first thing first, girl let's do what we rehearsed
And don't get nervous now, just show me break-breaky
Get up and take a stance and if you wanna get me

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs

[Verse 2 - Nelly]
She still talkin loud, but she ain't sayin nothin
Why you ain't movin ma, DJ ain't playin nothin
You tell him play this heerre, until the speakers blow
(Justin Timberlake: birthdays pick a place, baby we could go)
Yeah, I like yo Air Max (Max), they showin no back (back)
She showin off her tats (tats)
You ain't know she slightly ghetto-ghetto, she bourghetto-zhetto
She 5'5 brown eyes, she in stiletto-letto (Justin Timberlake : baby)
Well did you come alone? (uh), oh you got 2 or 3
That ain't no thang baby girl, cause I got 2 with me
And we gon' all kick it (yes we are), and you about to see (oh yes we are)
Just what a day would be if you was in the ride with me
(Justin Timberlake: turnin on the headlights)
Yeah and we be ... (JT: runnin all the red lights)
Oh, it's full steam ahead (yeah), and ain't no stoppin now (naw)
Now come on heere and drop it and J gon' tell you why

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs

[Break - Nelly] + (Justin Timberlake)
Now all my midwest shorties, come on do that thang, I see it
(Dance for me, dance for me, yeah)
Uh, uh, now all my down south shorties, come on do that thang, c'mon
(Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on)
Yeah, yeah, my east coast shorties, come on do that thang, I see it
(Dance for me, dance for me, yeah)
Now all my west coast shorties, c'mon do that thang, c'mon
(Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on)

[Verse 3 - Nelly]
She still talkin loud, but I hear her better now
She keep a thong print on, in any weather now
No sight of a band, but I can hear the horns playin
(Justin Timberlake: *imitititing horns*)
Oh, she got me +Hypnotized+, kinda like that +Biggie+ guy
Cause she been tryna prove a point, well since we've been inside
Can't wait to get it on (on), just wait 'til we get home
I'm on somethin, call my partner J, (JT: momma, come on)

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs

[Outro - Nelly] + (Justin Timberlake)

Yeah, uh, uh
C'mon baby work it for me, yeah ..
NAWWW!
Oh, let me see it, let me see it
(I just want to see you work it)

Yeah, um, uh, uh, uh
