[Verse 1]
I'll take a runaway train from the reigns of shame
And focus things so my head don't hear my brain
It's how I'm seeing - keeping it even with balanced breathin
When the Zion train come it's the last one leavin
I'll be long gone, when I'm finally home
Just relaxing from the action in the danger zone
It's my rest bit, catching my breath before I exit
Return to the Earth, be on some next shit, bless this!

[Chorus]
One time, maintain shine, chains can't bind, free your mind!
Lemme holla, lemme holla, lemme holla, lemme holla
Aiyyo one time, maintain shine, chains can't bind, free your mind!
Lemme holla, lemme holla, lemme holla, lemme holla

[Verse 2]
Scolding sill, mellow ice grill, people keep on telling me to chill
But I know it only poetry can feel
With emotions that I mostly need to heal
It's all part feeling, strong whip black children
March through the streets with a million
Dealing with injurious, just us against us
We must bust back until they vanquished
Attack, pull over fool this is a jack
Now gimme back the fad and my bamma weed sack
My culture, every day I'm getting closer
Living it up like I'm supposed ta
Who the king ruling this? (Jah!!)
Jah the light'll never miss ya
One of these days I'm gonna kiss ya
Touch you with my lips against the cheek
Gonna hit ya, so every day I'm reading scripture
One day!

[Chorus]

Holla (holla!) holla (holla!) [4X]

Let's get steady the beat get 'eavy
When this hit you better get ready
Barricade your brain the fallout to deadly
Runaway for the 'ad the Serengeti
The good that you speak no speak of the smelly
Stink like meat gone bad brother tell me
Why you never want to call Jah from the celly?
Why you wanna never call Jah from the celly yo?

[Verse 3]
Maybe gold, when I unload, make an ego explode uh
They be gone soon's I enter in the do' uh
We be venting unrelenting too cold uh
Fuck a white collar, sucker can't do me nada
Been in a lotta situations made it hotter
Homie but we gotta live it gotta follow
Give it then I get it, spit it make it proper
It's alright, plus my mic sound nice
Flip it, be specific, them yell dice
We fly on a gamble, try learn to handle
Ways that the days of life fade to candle
And flicker, sicker, black when the cut back
'Fore we lose track of where we at...

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
