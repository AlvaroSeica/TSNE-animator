Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I stay with the black bans, new chain, black range
Niggas the lid burfs, no this is not nerf
Fly past your head like a frisbee on Sunday
Got a stolen car, I'm just riding down the 1 way
Listening to music, and in the shower boosting
Will you ever leave the game
Bitch are ou stupid?
Bitch are you cupid, can you put it in the air
A lot of niggas rap, but don't nobody care
I'm shittin in the game while I'm staying in my lane
Keep my hands on the brakes, cause shit be changing
Niggas from the street need 2 a loaf
I ask how much you spend you say fuck what it cost
I get a lot of money and it start to turn me off
I'd rather have real friends and buy a new house
Fuck em, I'm a keep it real
They said they couldn't count
When they moms put em out

I was there in the drought
Niggas fakin on me, I was in you was out
Niggas locked to the street, let the hood in my house
But a coupel suckers see, that a nigga made it out
Plus, fuck em, shit, man fuck em
Niggas be faking
One thing that I learned, niggas gonn watch you
Most you grew with, the niggas turn impostors
A lot of niggas be fakin need to ask em
My gun just jammed, so I can't trust the choppas
I can't even trust the gun
You know, ban the guns, ban the knives
All that shit, you don't need the weapons nigga
What the fuck you need a weapon for
You scared, boy?
You scared out here boy?
I don't need no weapon nigga
I'm coming straight with the hands
Thugged out seriously, ok?
That's real nigga, real b, swag</pre>
