[Layzie Bone]
What the fuck is up, in the place to be
First up on the mic is Layzie B-O-N-E
{*edit*} on the beat, {*edit*} in the cut
So listen up close while I tear this shit up
Well I'm Layzie Bone and I got paper galore
Now you might have a lot of money, but I got much more
This new shit (new shit) finna hit the sto'
And when it do, nigga cop it, jump in your ride and roll
Blow one and smoke some'n, Layzie {*edit*} want some'n
We only did this, so you could hear music with no frontin
My mentor is Eazy-E, he snatched me off the block
Drankin a fifth of Hennessy while I was listenin to 'Pac
Got in the booth, my attitude was like, "Make y'all feel it"
And let my tombstone read, "He was one of the realest"
And when it's all said and done I'll be tellin you what I been through
I got kids, part two, nigga the saga continues

[Chorus 2X: Layzie Bone]
I try almost anything to collect my mail
I try almost anything to stay out of jail
And I'm not a coward so I'll never ever tell
Rather kill a copper than them put me in a cell

[Bizzy Bone]
And don't even worry when we scurry up in the flurry, it's getting blurry
In the stormy of the purgatory, the thought for me
Wanna eat with the angels be patient, still wait for the party baby
What party? I party, you and your body baby
Right here, right now, get 'em up when they get down
Shake thoughts, don't know what they caught all in my brain now
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit amen
In the name of our lord and savior Jesus Christ amen
You better believe it, I will say it again, and again
Jesus! From this day forth, God willin
Lean back chillin, precious medal of steel, titanium
Nine percent of the cranium, baby you feel me?
No adultery-dultery, when I see-ee, I see-ee, we kill 'em
Stays dry for me daddy, baby sunset
Come get a taste of what you never had, you ain't cum yet?

[Chorus]

[Layzie Bone]
Back to back, yeah we swangin them, big NUTS is danglin
Puttin everything on the line, when it goes down, we bang with 'em
Soldiers yeah, we hang with 'em; bustas, no we don't claim 'em
We don't allow them in our sections so keep it movin, you blame us?
Niggaz is total strangers, my family's so tight-knitted
Thuggish Ruggish committed, you other niggaz forget it
Get on, cause this here is a family affair
We thugged out Thug brothers puttin the smoke in the air, so c'mon

[Chorus]</pre>
