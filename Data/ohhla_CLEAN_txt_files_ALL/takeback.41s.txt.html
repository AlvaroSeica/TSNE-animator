Just when you doubt it we make you believe that shit
Since there ain't no more E I need a C class Benz
But anyway, you stunnin get stumped out
Eye swolle and ya motha'fuckin teeth knocked out
We them niggaz that don't front roll and smoke blunts
Stayed outside all night and sold chumps to the crackheads
We rep now so that's dead, we just goin hard
Flowin bars wit millions to get, we don't need no charge
QB from the womb to the tomb, 41st side things comin through

or get stabbed and poked up, or get that ass yoked up

[Chorus: Bars-N-Hooks]
[Bars] Every block every hood

[Bars] Every gangsta and gangstress
[Hooks] Every thug every bitch

[Both] We make nigga make cash wit this

[Chorus: Chinky]
All gangstas and gangstress that take chips
Every block every hood that's slingin the grave shifts
Every thug every bitch wit plans to get rich
Every blood every crip thats step to ages

[Mike Delorean aka Hooks]
Like this guns and grams trucks and vans
You get shot stand knuckle down the Earthquake slam
We the illest niggaz doin this dunn
We independent, all our own all alone
its just us, the Bridge, Bars-N-Hooks
The kid, Delorean Mr. Bars and Lakey the Kid
We some Black Entrepreneurs wit nines and ruthless
Try to wash all this dough from tours and shows
Put the bullshit to the side, for the friendship its business
We sellin albums out of our Benzes
We gon' make records and move units
We gon' take all the dough til they can't take the music
Do it do it, come on come on, do it nigga
The beat don't stop so we don't stop nigga
We go extra hard so we don't flop
the 41st side of QB guns pop
It's Queens-Bridge, ya' know who it is
It's QB nigga, Da da da Bridge

[Chorus: Bars-N-Hooks]
[Bars] Every block every hood
[Hooks] it's all good
[Bars] Every gangsta and gangstress
[Hooks] Every thug every bitch
[Bars] Every blood every crip
[Both] We we gon' make 'em dance to this

[Chorus: Chinky]
All gangstas and gangstress that take chips
Every block every hood that's slingin the grave shifts
Every thug every bitch wit plans to get rich
Every blood every crip thats step to ages

[Don Alon aka Bars]
Load up the glocks, put one in the head
now for cd blocks where the killers rest
and thieves yea they plot
Where we jooks spot and out of towners get popped
For comin through at the wrong time, blatin when we not
Cuz we robbers that mask up and squeeze revolvers
8 shots no shells no trench no face
just a whole lot blood and brains all in your Range
Shots exchange from the barrel to your chest
Empty the whole clip bow and have you gassin for breath
So whatÂ’s next?, cuz to this game we a threat
Got a million of Bars that ain't here yet
It's QB nigga, 40th to the 41st

[Chorus: Chinky] **repeat 2X**
All gangstas and gangstress, that take chips
Every block every hood that's slingin the grave shifts
Every thug every bitch wit plans to get rich
Every blood every crip that's step to ages</pre>
