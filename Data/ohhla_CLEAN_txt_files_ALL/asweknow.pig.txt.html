[Chorus]
It's the end of the world as we know it (2x)
It's the end

[Verse One]
What up Jesus? What up my nigga, my man?
Can I ask you couple questions 'bout the whole dang plan?
Why the Holocaust? 
Why the slavery?
Why the Crusades in the name of bravery?
Why you let little girls get molested dog?
I mean God I mean you know what I mean is all
And the fall of Adam and Eve is all it took
To leave the whole human race lost and shook?
That don't make sense it don't feel right
But I can see your whole face up in the moonlight
Dang you look crazy 
You make a negro wanna cry
You hold the whole ocean in your eyes
Are you crying too?

[Chorus]
It's the end of the world as we know it (4x)
We know it so well

[Verse Two]
What up Jesus? What up my mellow my man?
Can I ask you couple questions 'bout the whole dang plan?
Why the wars? 
Why the death?
Why the burning crucifix and the rest?
So much drama 
So many stars
Did you really hang out at the bars?
I thought you did 
You look crazy
You ever have a bar fight Patrick Swayze?
No disrespect dude, why am I sobbing?
I can't stop stopping 
You look like Ab Rude and Bill Cosby 
Mixed together
I can't explain it 
I'm freaking mad at you
Why you let it happen like this? I'm asking you
Why aren't you talking? 
Answer me
Every step you take is a freaking tragedy
Every step you take is a freaking, aaaaaahhhh

[Chorus]
It's the end of the world as we know it (4x)
We know it so well

[Bridge]
We know it so well
La la la la la la la la la
We know it so well
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
Thank you J-Beits

[Verse Three]
What up Jesus? (Yes?) 
What up my nickel, my man?
Can I ask you couple questions about the whole dang plan?
Without an answer 
You stretch out your hand
With a look in your eyes that you understand
All the pain all the loss all the confusion
All the up and the downs are now amusing
And I spent all of my life rushin' and hustlin'
When I could've just been your friend
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
We're drinking coffee in sun
All my friends, the old and young
And its okay now
We're drinking coffee in the sun
All my friends the old and young
And it's okay now
It's okay now
It's okay now</pre>
