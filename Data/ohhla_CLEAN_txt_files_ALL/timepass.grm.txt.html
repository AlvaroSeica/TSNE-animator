Chorus: Ronnie Spencer
Time
Keeps on
Tickin'
Passin' me by
Livin'
In the
Ghetto
Is how we survive

[Grimm]
(Verse 1)
When we was fifteen
There was no fucking 'round with his team
Take the chance and be the one that come up missing
Sixteen
He made us move, went out in ten speed
Seventeen, eighteen, FED's been listening
Nineteen
It all went down without a hitch, cop
Said they got it for twenty, but it was more like fifty six
And this a bitch
Twenty one, still tickin'
Twelve months later, in the streets, a meal ticket
Still stickin' to the subject, if it's personal or's public
The blue is the owner, moves, badges
Loved it
Rides in the former, cash, coke and crack whores
Tips and plane trips, to slip through back doors
He jacked yours
And his or hers if it was necessary
Holdin' the safe to push in weight, something legendary
Guessin' that ain't we, mysteries, missing link
Hit it deep, sit and think, he didn't sleep, he didn't blink

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
Twenty three, dippin' ki's, flippin' three for fifty G's
At seventeen a piece, he'll make a move, the trigger squeezed
Nigga, please
It's bigger things, better days
Didn't squeeze the gat away, if he think, he's there to pray
He let it play, let it in, set a trend within
When he turned twenty four, lettin' in the pen
Said the plan was in
One to trust with your life
With your money, with your work, with your kids, with ya wife
Twenty five, on the run, but the laws ain't chasin'
Did the job, got it done, said the boss, said nathan
Meaning nothing with the bustin', but trust when I say he doesn't
They wasn't the one for cussin', unless it was always somethin'
But cousin, you know and I know, that can be anything
The prince of the city crime committee, they gon' see when they can
Ain't gon' be many thing, cools, clips, a outcast
To outlast, evidence ain't worried about that

[Ronnie Spencer]
Time
Keeps on
Tickin'
Passin' me by
The ghetto (Keeps on tickin'...)
Keeps on tickin' on (Tickin' on...)</pre>
