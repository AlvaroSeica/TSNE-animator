Get up bitch, get up bitch

(Hook, Juicy J &amp; [Kreayshawn])
You trippy mane [She trippy mane]
I'm trippy mane [We trippy mane]
You trippy mane [She trippy mane]
I'm trippy mane [We trippy mane]
I'm smokin Cali Kush, pour up the drank [Heeeyy]
With a lotta bad bitches, gettin trippy mane

(Verse 1, Juicy J)
Juicy J and Kreayshawn
That's a smokin marathon
I take a shot; I take a shot
That's a drinkin marathon (Mm-hmm)
Double cup of that kick stand (Yup)
All I know is big bands (Yup)
Juicy J got bitches (Ho)
Fuck with my pimp-in (Oh)
Pinky ring on my pimp hand (Oh!)
With a lean as I pimp-stand (What?)
Oohh, it sound like Snoop Dogg (Hey!)
Coupe De Ville with two broads (Oh)
Sippin on that Texas-T
Niggas call me "Boss Hogg" (Trippy!)
At yo' local college, baggy full of Aderall (So trippy!)
With a strap on me, FUCK the gun law (Too trippy!)
If you blow my high, then I'm goin off
Trippy-trippy-trippy; I don't think you get it, mane (No sir!)
I walk around the club; Smellin like incener's, mane

(Hook, Juicy J &amp; [Kreayshawn])
You trippy mane [She trippy mane]
I'm trippy mane [We trippy mane]
You trippy mane [She trippy mane]
I'm trippy mane [We trippy mane]
I'm smokin Cali Kush, pour up the drank [Mmm, heeeyy]
With a lotta bad bitches, gettin trippy mane [Hey!]
[Yeah, ho] You trippy mane [She trippy mane]
[Yeah, ho] I'm trippy mane [We trippy mane]
[Yeah, ho] You trippy mane [She trippy mane]

[Yeah, ho] I'm smokin Cali Kush, [Duhhh] pour up the drank [Hey!]
[Yeah, ho] With a lotta bad bitches, gettin trippy mane [Yeah, ho]

(Verse 2, Kreayshawn)
He a trip, I'm a trip, but no fallin out
We bad, pourin syrup all up on the trap couch
Purple body-shots on that bitch, I let it drip
Rolled her head back, now she sayin she can't handle it
That's Kreay, she hit a trippy stick out her ass
Juicy J sat me down and tought me well in trippy class
I got so much trip, I fell asleep high
I woke up high; If I'm sober, I lie
That's some downers mane, they really got my mind zingin
If I was a car, I'd be purple woodgrain swingin (Heeeeyyyyy)
Leanin, never beanin; Felonies and misdemeanors
So trippy mane, you can call me "Juicy Ginaaa"

(Hook, Juicy J &amp; [Kreayshawn])
You trippy mane [She trippy mane]
I'm trippy mane [We trppy mane]
You trippy mane [She trippy mane]
I'm trippy mane [We trippy mane]
I'm smokin Cali Kush, pour up the drank [Mmm, heeeyy]
With a lotta bad bitches, gettin trippy mane [Hey!]
[Yeah, ho] You trippy mane [She trippy mane]
[Yeah, ho] I'm trippy mane [We trippy mane]
[Yeah, ho] You trippy mane [She trippy mane]
[Yeah, ho] I'm trippy mane [We trippy mane]
