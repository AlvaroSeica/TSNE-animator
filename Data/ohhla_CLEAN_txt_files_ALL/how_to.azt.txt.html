Song:   How to Catch a Bullet
Typed by: prince@macmail.com

I'm showing you all the ways on how to catch a bullet
Show me your hand, show me your card, I'll show you how to pull it
The tensions of the way that life is set
Hair triggers walkin around with no safety net
And you can bet that they're always somebody ready to make a threat
So you better step lightly and carry a big stick
Ain't no time to think when the bullet is so quick
It's a trip, caught a bullet when you didn't think you could
Some tense mother fucker shot you dead where you stood and its all good

[Chorus]
How many ways is there to catch a bullet, catch a bullet, catch a bullet
How many ways? (3x)

The hand is quicker than the eye
But the fingers on the trigger and the aim is set high
Somebody better reach for the sky
Now your ready to catch a bullet but the trick is not to die
Let if fly, let it fly, let it go
From which direction its comin you'll never know
So can you watch your back, can you watch your head
With a snake under foot it's a fact you better not tread
So when the curve is thrown don't think twice
Catch it with your heart and your life is the price
It's a slice of American apple pie, god bless America, god bless this lie

[Chorus]
How many ways is there to catch a bullet, can you tell me?
How many ways? (3x)

No me tengo miedo por que de nada me espanto
Pero el dia que me muero moreria unos cuantos
Anti-humanistas, neoliberalistas
Los pinches agresores del ejercito Zapatista!

[Repeat Chorus]</pre>
