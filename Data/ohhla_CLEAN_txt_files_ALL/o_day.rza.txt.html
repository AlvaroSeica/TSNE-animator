[Intro: RZA]
Hip hop is all about having fun, yo, yo

[RZA]
Sword still swing like Kenobi, ya'll cowards know me
Wit the strength of Samson, you still couldn't hold me
I got the rock stone from David's slingshot
Who could master the wisdom to which Rakeem got?
Watch for the cops, third eye like the Cyclops
Red from the chronic, don't need no eye drops
Swinging white tops on the block til 4 o'clock, then hit IHOP's
Fiends in line like I, Robot
Take a hit, and transform like the GoBots
Tell my uncle that I know what he know not
Bank like Agent Cody, on the hunt like raping coyotes
Wild like forty Mexicans sippin' on peyote
In an all black Toyota, W's on the grill, steering wheel and the motor
Out to get the mills, til I'm paid like Bob DeNiro
With seven prime numbers that's followed by God zero's
MC epitome, but these ducka sucka muthafuckas trying to get rid of me
But if you decipher my lyrics, truthfully and not critically
You'll see I influence the world mentally as well as physically
Emotionally, promotionaly, devotionally, socially
Speak the truth, and tell you how it's supposed to be
Zig Zag Zilla came, where's up the hilla man?
Bododo, rewind that shit
Sword still swing like Kenobi, ya'll cowards know me
Wit the strength of Samson, you still couldn't hold me
I got the rock stone from David's slingshot
Who could master the wisdom to which Rakeem got?
Watch for the cops, my third eye like the Cyclops
Red from the chronic, I don't need no eye drops
Swinging white tops on the block til 4 o'clock, then hit IHOP's
Fiends in line like I, Robot
Take a hit, and transform like the GoBots
Tell my uncle that I know what he know not
Bank like Agent Cody, on the hunt like raping coyotes
Wild like forty Mexicans sippin' on peyote
In an all black Toyota, W's on the grill, wheel and the motor
Heading to North Dakota
With the cocaine, plus the baking soda
MC epitome, but these savages trying to get rid of me
If you decipher my lyrics, truthfully not critically
You'll see I influence the world mentally as well as physically
Emotionally, promotionaly, devotionally, socially
Nigga, tell you how it's supposed to be
Zig Zag Zilla came, bododododododo
Where's up the hilla, man?
Ya'll cowards know me, hahahahahahaha

[Chorus: RZA]
D for Digital, I - Irresistible
G be Graphical, I - Immeasurable
T come Technical, A - Analytical
L be that Lyrical, who? Bobby Digital
D for Digital, I - Irresistible
G be Graphical, I - Incredible
T for Technical, A - Analytical
L for Lyrical, who? Bobby Digital

[Outro: RZA (Prodigal Sunn)]
(Yeah, we gon' take it back RZA)
Who the fuck stepped on the wire?
You stupid mutha - BRRR
Hahahahaha, so you thought you was going to escape, didn't you?
You thought you could escape?
Aiyo, let the wolves in, aiyo, son
Aiyo, G, yo, let the wolves in
All the niggas in the back
All the wolves in the back, come up front
We gon' get savage real quick
Fuck that, aiyo, hold on, hold on, hold on, nigga
Man, get the fuck off my feet, man
Fuck off nigga, I'm trying to do my shit
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, Happy New Year, nigga
Merry Christmas, it's July, hahahahah
So the mad scientist continued to drink the Digital Elixir
Fighting with the good and evil inside himself
Trying to be Bobby, trying to be RZA
Trying to be one, trying to be real
Trying to be unreal, trying to be super real, nigga
Rest in peace to the ODB, greatest MC of all time, greatest performer
One of the greatest performers of all times
Aiyo, O, yo, O, happy birthday, nigga, hahahahaha</pre>
