we all know deep down that one day we all will just

eat resistance
sleep resistance
reep resistance
resist

check the junglistic jibber jaw 
at the drum and bass seminar
with the troubadour peep the metaphor
less is more when you're at the resevoir
glass half empty glass half full
keep your eyes out for the crystal skulls
rock the riddim with thoughts intelligent
carve my name in it on the wet cement
i triple the syllable with a titanium telescope
medicine vehicle then i defeated the simpletons
taking a chance on the nanobot bicycle 
delegate melting your element into a vacuous nebula
gravity gripping up everything
retina spotting the obvious entity
coagulate caligula
boiling point gwan culminate
sustain the pulserate with a dubplate
its not too late we still got time
they could never kill the shine
triple space the darkness is
building a metropolis
a shrine upon the fingertip
heaven sent specimen mescaline pyramid
it never stops, the pod splits
nanobot apocalypse
theres a paradox in the way we walk 
somethings got to give
and i'mma gonna come upon the micrphone
and never ever stop it with the force of a comet
or meteoroid, buildestroy microchips ahoy killjoy
sitting duck sigmund freud
pon the couch and i'm bouncing
millenium falcon countdown two thousand 
move mountains
whistle heavy rocks into position
and channel the mandelbrot algorythm
bout to hit em with a total eclipse
flow with the script its the vocal abyss
resistance is fertile wild for the night
website megabyte dendrite
peptide nematode enzyme anecdote
cranial hijack anti climax
saphire amethyst, try and censor this
america is the terrorist
there it is plain to see
negativity cant damage we
we reiterate data and vedic integrity ready 
for whatever penalty buries we

eat resistance
sleep resistance
reep resistance
resist

all eye seeing supreme neo elohim being
the premium paramecium never ceases releasing
amnesia magnesium
got your brain freezin
and you aint even know theres paint on your sleeve and
the train is leaving on this fateful evening
return to the ancient season
veritcal mosaic
certainly plague language serve you to the curb of the pavement
but dont be worried or anxious
i'll murder you painless
with a nervous arrangement
oh check it the current is dangerous
everthing is in its place
circulates and leaves a trace
disintegrating and reapearing
with the fate that we keep fearing
tearing down like all of them walls
remember that love conquers all
phenobarbitol this the actual
drop the waterfall keep it casual
this is the art of doing nothing
keep it moving keep it bumping
the manner in which i pimp comes 
to prominence over the elongated course
of a trillion light years
bending time diodes and crystaline structures
the number cruncher puffing the chumba wamba
up in the tundra
thunda clap thunda cat riding on a hovercraft
mustard gas keep it under raps
i'm choppin the track like a lumberjack</pre>
