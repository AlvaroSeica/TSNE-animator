{Hook}

Watch me daddy, watch me move like a snake
Watch me daddy, watch me move like a snake
Watch me daddy, watch me move like a snake
You'll get hypnotized (uh huh) and mezmorized
Watch me daddy, watch me move like a snake (Like a Snake)
Watch me daddy, watch me move like a snake (Like a Snake)
Watch me daddy, watch me move like a snake (Yeah)
You'll get hypnotized, (uh huh) and mezmorized

[Verse 1]
I'm gon' move dis body cuz I'm gon' take care of home
Yeah, I'm talkin' bout my man cause I don't want him to roam
So I got to make him feel good and please all his needs
Know what I'm sayin' he can get something out of me
As long as he twork me, (uuh)  long as he works me (yeah)
Got me feeling all so good even when he hurt me
Cause he put it on me, just like I put it on you
What dis body, it might hypnotize you
You see me shakin' dat ass, tworkin these hip (these hips)
Mayn lickin' my lip, mayn ain't I a trip
While I'm rubbin my monkey and smackin' my ass
Got your soldier standing ten hut ready to blast on me

{Hook}

[Verse 2]
Boy I got what you want, boy I got what you need
Satisfaction guaranteed when you fuckin' wit me
Get you sprung like a junky got you hittin' dat pipe
But I got you sprung on dis moneky cause dem ends still tight
Now nigga, rock your boat,(yeah) work your middle (uuuuhh)
Its that simple cause I use prudential
Have you callin' out my name, got you goin' insane
Got you hypnotized and mezmorized mayn what da game
I got dat bomb ass pussy, dat bomb ass pussy
Have you straight loosin' your mind ready to do something to me
Cause its da, big deal see me riding dat dick
Now aaaah, what me move my body like thisssssssss
