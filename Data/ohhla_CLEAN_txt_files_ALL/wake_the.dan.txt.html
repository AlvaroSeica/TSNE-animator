[Verse 1]
Poppin Percocets at the circus with Kirk Cameron
Standing in satin Hammer pants nervous and stammerin'
Burstin' cannons at cannibals, slurpin' cans of Squirt with mannequins
Danimals licking yogurt from their mandibles
Famished, naked nurses with cans as big as the Earth is
Handing me burgers and sandwiches? Candice Bergen

[Verse 2]
Copasetic, my necklace was so deceptive
Told me that my check was supposed to be here before breakfast
I'm no detective, poked my nose in a septic
Tank, while I'm robbin' a bank on the coast of Texas
Posted Beck's bail, drove off in a stolen Lexus
The +Modern Guilt+ had made us go and wreck it, Seth Rogen</pre>
