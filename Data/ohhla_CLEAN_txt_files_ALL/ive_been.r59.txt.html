Somebody very dear to me just attempted to kill herself
It showed me we don't fear death, we fear fear itself
Ever since, '98 in hip-hop my presence been felt
Couple dollars, couple models, couple of bitch niggaz under my belt
Thorough nigga, I'ma hold you to it if we handshake
My, Plan B is to complete Plan A
Grindin been my strategy, like dissin my anatomy
I should get a tat on me that say, why
Why why - would you let some dollars dictate on me
I brush my shoulders off, polish off haters
If you play me I will spray ya potata, later for fakers
I put 'em in the news of the major paper
My roller coaster of a career
Hope it's been real for you because it's been weird for me
I feel like - they can take away the cars, they can take away the cash
But I bet you that they can't take the realness that's in ME~!

[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9"]
I've been up, I've been down
I don't give a fuck, yeah
I've been up, I've been down
I don't give a fuck, yeah
I've been up, I've been down
I don't give a fuck
They can take away the cars, they can take away the cash
But I bet you that they can't take the realness that's in ME~!

I just want momma to be happy
Is that too motherfuckin much to ask?
Damn, I'm 'bout to cry in this bitch
King of the jungle, I hate liars but I'll fuck with a lioness bitch!
If you don't straighten yo' ass out right now
I will find you and iron you, bitch~!
Grindin been my strategy, like dissin my anatomy
I should get a tat on me that say, why
Why why - would you let losses make you act like a faggot
I'm fly (I'm fly) and you act like a maggot
Money comes, money goes
I used to wear funny clothes
Hammer pants, my momma used to wipe my runny nose
My real fam-a-lam, all I care about is her
I'm feelin like - they can take away the cars, they can take away the cash
But I bet you that they can't take the realness that's in ME~!

[Chorus]

Then I watch my daddy hit my momma, listen to my momma
tryin to calm us, "Y'all don't understand the problem that we have"
Who gives a shit about dollars when you gotta go visit your father in rehab?
He said "Rick, Ryan, Marcus - long as I'm gettin high your momma will be sad
And only I can fix this, so I'ma turn this all around, I promise"
As we sit, he said "I'm down right now in life, you know I'ma be back"
And when he got back home it was like it was heaven-sent
Cause I was only 11 at the time and he's been clean and sober ever since
He gave me this advice, you at a huge advantage
Long as you know what's rules in life, and a view for the planet
Rather you the man or you the mechanic
People treat money like oxygen, when they got it then they take it for granted 
{*gasp*} but then lose it and panic
So spoken G - I look at him like Superman
And y'all lil' niggaz ain't even close to me so if he can fall, so can we
They can take away the cars, they can take away the cash
But I bet you that they can't take the realness that's in ME~!
