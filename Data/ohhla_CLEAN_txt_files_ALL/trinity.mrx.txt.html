Verse 1:

A session with my vocals, bound to upset the locals
My sound like testing at nuclear weapons disposals
Provide the shelter when the mess has gone global
Survival letter and a message for the hopeful
Spread it to the mobile, second that the record blow
Impact resembling sacorro new mexico
Radiation cause all organic flesh to glow
Fry the skeletal, crystallized spectacle
Lie symetrical, the sky sentinel
With live chemical human lives expendable
My mind developing to be, twice the emcee
I'm twenty kilotons of TNT
Destruction and debris, can happen with a mere visit
Fashioned by the manhattan engineer district
My tracks prolific, appear clearer, block is foggy
The blast ballistic its Hiroshima, Nagasaki

Hook X2:

A gift for the youth, its in me to write
I give you the proof, its in me to fight
I give you the truth, just gimme the mic
The studio booth the trinity site 

Verse 2

Holding the mic, implosion designed, plutonium device
Strobes of light, froze oceans filled boulders of ice
Decode the hype, never portray a sloppy effort
Reactor blow your body severed
Buried in the mojave desert
Send piles of the devastation, rebel basin
Placed ten miles from the detonation
Acid diminished the devils agent
Gadget finished the final levels of test preparation
Los Alamos, touch huge crowds
Instrumental shockwaves mushroom clouds
Silo damage, cause worldwide panic
Engineering mixed with hydrodynamics
My style package, I validate the influence
To physics, when I recalibrate the instruments
Man created stimulants, victims will flee
Listen to me, it's on and popping literally
