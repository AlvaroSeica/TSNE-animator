Triple bodypass, put it on my tab America!

[Chourus] {2X}
We're black and we wanna be white
We're black and we wanna be white
We're black and we wanna be white
All night, all right, all hype

[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]
I'm black, wanna be white
For the first time in life I wanna be right
I know this is wrong, I didn't get to choose, they frisk me at night
I know what it is, give me the light
If I was blindfold I'd be invisible to pig's sight
I'm black wanna be white, well dressed, speakin' polite
Self stressed, livin' a lie, well I guess...it's good life
All the dudes I payed, I wanna be DUDE in the shade
Rockin' hard like I was raised in the rays...RAYZ
Got the vocab, that made most mad, when I spoke like brad, is it bad?
I think, drink, joke, and smoke like that
Keekin' trees, these bad seeds hang on corners
Raised by murderers and mourners
I'm gunna be the shit at the meeting statistically speaking
Playing golf on the weekend, with Ralph Lauren, Christopher, and Keenan
When the Ike be weighin's, the scales brake, you can deny me payment
Well alright, I'm all white...I'll finnaly make it

[Chorus: C-Rayz &amp; 4th Pyramid] {2X}
We're white but we wanna be black
We're white but we wanna be black
We're white but we wanna be black
Fight back, like this, like that

[Verse 2: 4th Pyramid]
White wanna black, a daunting task
Just hauntin these gats, drunk...started to laugh
My complex is like clog(?) my dad
I respect you, you started the fad
I got no problems with that but
how would you feel if you lived in the village
and were told all your ancestors did was steal, kill, and pillage?
I know, not of my past
One grown out the gods, anonymous tags
Bergen bestowed, I want to escape
But I don't have it made cos of my skin, it's just not the case
Family don't understand artistic views
Feel like 'DAMMIT, why I have to live with fools?'
I did me, fuck what I did in school
To live free, feels like forbidden fruit
I'm shackled, need my gene pool, but it's all scattered
Call devil cos I need food, it don't matter

[Chorus]
We're black and we wanna be white
We're black and we wanna be white
We're black and we wanna be white
All night, all right, all hype
We're white but we wanna be black
We're white but we wanna be black
We're white but we wanna be black
Fight back, like this, like that

[Verse 3: &amp; C-Rayz &amp; 4th Pyramid]
If you black, with a degree, and you work
and got a happy family, they say you wanna be WHIIIITE
If you white, with belts??, smoke weed, listen to rap
and live free, they say you wanna be BLAAAACK
There's nothing in between, so this medium means
you double excel on smallville, and dinner is beans
There's two classes - the rich and the poor
Everybody else - run wild in the halls!
[4th Pyramid]
I envy long standin' tradition
Tension starts from what you do to me through dissin'
Stop, the past is done, and was never my ambition
And now I owe Grant for that tin can for pissin???
Cos some of my people poverty stricken
Sleepin in the same spot that they probably shit in
Kill you in Alaska for some gold
Still viewed as master of the globe

[Chorus]
We're black and we wanna be white
We're black and we wanna be white
We're black and we wanna be white...</pre>
