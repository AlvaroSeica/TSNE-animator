Typed by: AZ Lyrics

She says hello in reply to hello
To me, she looks a like a full moon of 14th day
With wishing good morning, she took the heart
The one who is like a thin kite took the heart
With a sweet smile she won my heart
She left nothing. She snatched everything
There is dizziness from the bottle (bottle of alcohol) with out drinking
She made me a wanderer
With wishing good morning, she took the heart
The one who is like a thin kite took the heart
Her immature youth is striking hard
It looks like she is roaming because she is hungry for love
Friends, she looked through eye contact
She asked me for love
With wishing good morning, she took the heart
The one who is like a thin kite took the heart
She looked at us so innocently
But now we worry what to do all the time
He used to sit quietly and write songs
He used to sit quietly and sing songs
she destroyed his concentrations
With wishing good morning, she took the heart
The one who is like a thin kite took the heart</pre>
