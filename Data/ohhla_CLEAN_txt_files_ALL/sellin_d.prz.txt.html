Typed by: ray6766@yahoo.com

[stic.man](talking)
Drugs oppress the people everyday

chorus: 1x (singing)
Sellin dope
Serving Weed
We had to hustle to hustle just to eat

[stic.man]
Aint no hope in the streets, you broke you sell dope
All my young niggaz outside hustlin coke
You know the drama
If you ain't sellin crack then its ganja
I been thru it dunn hittin niggaz two for one
Pullin guns out and bustin my shit too, WHAT!
I ain't give a fuck I use to get a rush when I bust mine
Baging up my nickels and dimes
Going thru difficult times
Writing my life story in rhymes
But when I look at all the niggaz they hit with mad time
In Proportion to the big kingpins it don't fit
You can get caught with barely a half a slab
And the judge sentence you like you ran the ave
I ain't plan to get rich from sellin that shit, it was survival
My gameplan was not to get knocked by five O
But who am I?
Just a young nigga caught in the mix
And if this weed don't sell I'ma cop me a brick

[Chorus: 2X]
Sellin dope
Serving Weed
We had to hustle to hustle just to eat

[m-1]
Its been a minute since I been in the game
Some years back I held crack I couldn't say the same thing
Ask my nigga bang double in Rahleigh
We was trouble, got the fiends spot bubbling hot
We wouldn't never make a lot
I mean not like Scarface or Neno Nrown or George Bush
No matter what you you push
It was politics and camera tricks very deceptive
Criminalize us and fooling the collector
For the most part we don't own no boats and planes
We just cop it from poppy and bag it in the cellophane
Its a family thing you got to hustle all night
Yo I seen fiends losing they brain for hard white
Ask my aunt and my brother and my stressed out mother
How realistic it gets its sadistic
Statisitic show its sick how we living
The one thing bigger then dope games is prisons
One million niggaz inside
over three million is tied
But the president lied
Because the white house is the rockhouse
Unclesam the pushaman
This is for my people on the island

[Chorus]

[singing - 2X]
But what we gonna do when we caught up
And have to face responsibility
[stic.man]
(this that ghetto shit, this that ghetto shit)[stic.man]

[stic.man]
Out on the block
White T-shirt army fatigue
Niggaz hold crack in the mouth watching for D's
Sellin dope
You know how it be
Tryna get the goverment cheese
And the D's yell freeze
Sellin dope
White T-shirt army fatigue
Niggaz hold crack in the mouth watching for D's
Sellin dope
You know how it be
Tryna get the goverment cheese
And the D's yell freeze</pre>
