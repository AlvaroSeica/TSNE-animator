[KiD CuDi]
Listen good: I don't have nobody
But what I might feel are the sounds of sanity
Hoping what I hear, loops itself continuously
Then I won't be afraid, noooo noooo

[Chorus: KiD Cudi]
Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa
Why must it feel so wrong when I try and do right.. do right
Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa
Soaring through paradise when I'm closing my eyes
I'm, Mr. Solo Dolo
Oh, oh, oh..
Oh, oh

[KiD CuDi]
Look at me uou tell me
Just what you see
Am I, someone whom, you may love, or enemy?
Am I, speaking for, you and yours, or someone else/
I need some answers
Yeaaaaaaaah, yeaaaaaaah

[Chorus:]
Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa
Why must it feel so wrong when I try and do right.. do right
Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa
Soaring through paradise when I'm closing my eyes
I'm, Mr. Solo Dolo
Oh, oh, oh..
Oh, oh

[KiD CuDi]
My world turns
Flippin the bird
To the ones who figure, me
Outkast, no, not the duo
Back at shaker heights
When they knew who
Though little brother was a strange one
Boo hoo, cry me a river
Hey, look who, try without an igloo
Cold cold world wasn't fit for me at, all
Look at where I stand at, tall, 
Clutchin' my Kid CuDi bi-zz-alls
Mute mutherfucker back home, quick pause
Gargle on my mayo
Look at me, I bet I'm the one you picked to fail
Floatin in my mind no sail
Ahoy... ahoy...
Listen good: I don't need nobody
This is what you feel are the sounds of insanity
Hoping what I hear loops itself to finish me
No, I won't be afraid
Heeeey, heeeeey

[Chorus: KiD CuDi]
Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa
Why must it feel so wrong when I try and do right.. do right
Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa
Soaring through paradise when I'm closing my eyes
I'm, Mr. Solo Dolo

[KiD CuDi]
Why must it feel so right when I know that it's wrong.. it's wrong
When will I ever learn from the words from my songs
I'm, Mr. Solo Dolo...</pre>
