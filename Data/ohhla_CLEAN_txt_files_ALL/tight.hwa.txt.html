[Chorus]
Yeah, you know
You want some tight tight pussy
(4X)

[Verse 1]
Stop what you're doing, and don't get nervous
I'm about to give your ass total lip service
It's about a tight pussy that you can call mine
Two inches away from my big ass behind
It might be tight, but it's deep as fuck
You might touch the bottom with a little bit of luck
'Cause I'm a real fine lady just driving you crazy
Foxy fine bitches in our skin tight britches
Not from tabloids or Star magazine
Put your dick in my pussy, I'll make your ass cream
It's so motherfucking tight, but you know it won't hurt
When your dick touch my pussy I'll make your ass work
Some tight tight pussy is coming your way
You better get ready 'cause my pussy don't play
It's tight

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Now enter this pussy, I'll make you wear a glove
'Cause I don't know where your dick been flaunting that love
Just to give a brief description, holding out a jimmy hat
Don't want no germs sticking in my cat
Just to stay on the safe side of everything
I'll make you wear a rubber just to keep the shit clean
I keep my pussy well protected with a nice clean cover
'Cause I know you fuck around with an outside lover
I treat it like a diamond on a rope chain
My pussy's going down in the hall of fame
The monkey is wild, no she can't be tamed
The bitch is so bad, so I gave her a name
It's called my pussy, pimp that mama
Like a clock on the wall, getting dollars
Meet me at the crib, and you're sure to get laid
You'll get none coming if I can't get paid
'Cause I'm macking, stacking, always packing
Steaming hot for the boys that are racking
Racking, no that ain't no joke
The man that makes that money from slinging pure white dope
My pussy don't care where them ends come from
Come on with the thousands and you're guaranteed to cum
Get your fuck on any time of night
But I must remind you, the pussy's just too tight

[Chorus] - 2X

[Verse 3]
Now at the end, I'd like to remind you
Dig in the pussy, your ass is through
You won't be the first, and sure not the last
Fine motherfucker to tap the ass
I had a lot of men before I met you
I'm a have a lot more before I get through
From coast to coast, I'm known very well
A hoe with an attitude that never been to jail
Fucking and sucking 'till my lips turn chafe 
But the pussy is tighter than a Century safe
Well known artists throughout the world
Want to pay ends just to sculpture my pearl
Consider yourself lucky, cause you're getting it on wax
You paid five dollars and a little bit of tax
It came from a hoe, so you know you got it right
But I'll say it again, my pussy's too tight

[Chorus]
