[Verse One: Rick Ross]
Fuck niggas always get the shit bad, best friend wanna stab you in the back
Ride 'round town sellin whip wait, gotta keep goin 'til I get straight
Last night they pull another body out the lake 
We got some zombies out here wanna eat a nigga face 
Gotta stay real nigga can't fake
Niggas got beef with a straight face
Can't have no zinc no extendo
Nigga wanna go to war holla ten fo'
Baby mama fuckin niggas strappin up the street
Though you seein all the traffic breakin down a key
If you got a pistol better hold it up nigga!
And you better keep it with you for these fuck niggas!
Say he want a kilo gotta pay tax!
Nigga kill Peanut he come to pay you back!!!!

[Verse Two: Rick Ross]
I'm lookin in your eyes and it's all fake
Niggas in the prison killin over Corn Flakes
Time to get a new Benz but I'm gon' WAIT
'Til the feds give my dawg his new release date
Young mogul but a nigga came from the mud
Say a prayer for my son, never be a thug
Came up with a plan, nigga I'm a mastermind
Richest nigga in the hood, I ain't hard to find
Swear to God Audemar nigga self made
Ain't got a lot of bitches cause I'm well paid
Blood leakin on my shirt to show my war wound
Gave a million to my dawg like for dog food
Real nigga known to do the real thangs
Standin on the 15th 'bout 15
AR-15, come and get me!!
And I know my real niggaz gon' miss me, MISS ME!!

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
You niggas 'gon feel this!!! LA LA LA LA!!! LA LA!!!
You niggas 'gon feel this!!! LA LA LA LA!!! LA LA!!!
You fuckin with the trillest!!! LA LA LA LA!!! LA LA!!!
You niggas 'gon feel this!!! LA LA LA LA!!! LA LA!!!
You niggas 'gon feel this!!! LA LA LA LA!!! LA LA!!!
You niggas 'gon feel this!!! LA LA LA LA!!! LA LA!!!
You fuckin with the trillest!!! LA LA LA LA!!! LA LA!!!
You niggas 'gon feel this!!! LA LA LA LA!!! LA LA!!!

[Outro: Rick Ross]
You niggas 'gon feel this!!! You niggas 'gon feel this!!!
You fuckin with the trillest!!! You niggas 'gon feel this!!!
