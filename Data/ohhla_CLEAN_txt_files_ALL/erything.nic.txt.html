Typed by: snscruz@gmail.com

[Chorus: Nickelus F]
I ain't doing everything that I should
And I ain't really try as hard as I could
If I could take some things back then I would
But I can't cause its life

[Nickelus F]
I'm from the good side of the tracks, but took a liking to Gat's
And I was toting them before I had time to react
Ended up in the jungle with lions, and tigers, and rats
Ended up with a hustle y'all, look at the size of my bags
Ended up with some muscle, think about the size of these mags
Before you come out your mouth, Ill shoot your tongue
Out your mouth, dump the gun
Out and bounce. Keep an eye out for the badge
And slow it down. We riding dirty, dont be driving to fast
Two pounds of the Mary Jane and you bouncing lane to lane
Is you crazed? if you get me locked I'm breaking legs
Matter of fact, pull over right here. Nigga I got it
I don't know why you trippin' but you acting out of pocket
Nigga you know the procedure, no speeding while we re-ing
Plus we chiefin' and I got a couple pills of the eat that
I was planing on giving a little later to this freak and
If we see the police, I won't get my chance to beat and nigga... (NO!)

[Chorus]

[Nickelus F]
Momma, I'm still thuggin' the world is a war zone
My homies is inmates and most of 'em dead wrong
And some of em dead gone, and some had they head blown
Wish I could take it back to you reading me bed poems
But I'm on my own now, I'm taller and grown now
I'm doing all the things that you wish I ain't know 'bout
I' using all the beams, bag and pitching the dro out
Been through everything that my good pen wrote 'bout
Like dippin' from the pigs, hitting fences, rip my britches
Kept a skippin, toss the biscuit, It's a throw away forget it
But I gotta keep my weedies, chances are they will not get me
And I'm gonna wanna smoke when I tell this to my niggas like
We was just chillin when two niggas robbed the building
And got away, but when the cops came they thought we was the villians
So we picked up, picked up, ran so fast they stopped and said forget it
Even though I'm glad I'm kinda mad I went and tossed my pistol but... (No)!

[Chorus]

[Nickelus F]
Yeah, I'm polishing pistols, prepare for battle pass the pump
And I'm popping the pistol and putting people in the trunk
I done peeled of from the po-po with pounds and I've been jumped
And I got niggas I know will get down if problems come. Get a gun
It's already on, It's already out, It's already in that nigga mouth
And I will take this nigga work
and flood the streets as if theres a drought and that way
And that way I'll be the mane and you can't front like you ain't know
I'm strutin like a young LL with the Kangol
Thang gone watching niggas flashing all they bank roll
And get that free money like contestants on a game show
We both got guns, but we don't do it the same though
My partna cop the copper I don't even need my aim hoe
Roll the window down, stick it out and let the thang go
Hit up everybody, if they don't get up that thang gone
Aim high, aim low, hit him in his mango
His girl is Chiquita, the heater turn her to a Jane Doe</pre>
