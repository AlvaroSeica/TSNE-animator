Song:   Calm But Deadly 
Typed by: thamasta@home.com

[Kung Fu Sample] 
You have offended my family.. 
and you have offended a Shaolin Temple! 

{*sounds of swordfight*} 

[Remedy] 
Laboratory tested and foolproof, inspected 
You've just been infected son the dart's been injected 
Straight ahead slowly but surely keep steady 
My everyday medley is +Calm But+ stay +Deadly+ 
Rap potions, free-willed controlled emotions 
Earth, wind, fire, air, land, sea and ocean 
The rap disease global, blow trees 
with the noblest MC's, Wu-Tang Killa Bees 
How High? Mass multiply, proven Wu ally 
Bobby blessed me with +The W+ and the power to fly 
Now I skyscrape it, landscape it 
Masquerade, hover above and watch these real cats fake it 

[Solomon Childs] 
Godfather spit lightenin 
Wu-Tang rookie of the year from Body Brighton 
Mastermind Killa Bee manhunts, Amsterdam blunts 
Legendary dart raves, for live renegades 
Bleed for green paper, repair miz 
My Killa Bee Swarm split wigs, break ribs 
Eighty-eight stick-up kids 
High drama, harpoon expert 
You see the God, you throw ya shine in ya sweatshirt 
Death before over-darted 
Me and the microphone barred, never departed 
Solomon be retarted, cold hearted 
Now you shook but you never, should have started 

[Chorus: Remedy (Solomon Childs)] 
Eh-yo, where you gonna run to? There's nowhere to hide 
(On some real live manhunt, take it in stride) 
We spit nothin but the real shit you bound to get hit 
(Takin off the with the torch once it's passed and lit) 
Eh-yo, where you gonna run to? (There's nowhere to hide) 
On some real live manhunt (Take it in stride) 
We spit nothin but the real shit (You bound to get hit) 
Takin off the with the torch (Once it's passed and lit) 

[Solomon Childs] 
General warfare manhunt for real 
What the deal? Hold more steal than kids under the stairs 
Move for thirty-six years, knowledge throughout my foundation 
Me and Remedy transport the devastation 
World war, comin for ya neck, body ya soul 
Upcome and behold, full control 
End the situation, figure ya fold 
Solomon Childs got this rap shit sold 
You wanna battle? Stop speakin in codes 
Highest level, ain't nobody gettin above me 
QBin on the Wu robbery 
Wildin like an HDM predicate with cuffs, G 
You don't want no problem 

[Remedy] 
Collaborate, Solomon style, thoughts elaborate 
Grown men congregate and come for ya magistrate 
Break through enemy lines, land up mines, levitate 
Quick son, motivate, no time to hesitate 
One wish, me and CO team six back in Auschwichz 
Table switch, US concentration camps exist 
We move in disguise, from Shaolin to Mount Siahnide 
Drama seconds, I blond remix from cyanide 
I seen it at the pyramid of Geezer, fear type Ceaser 
+CREAM+ resembles the Scrooge of Ebenezer 
The rich get richer, we use words to paint pictures 
You want the truth? +Words to Live By+, run and get ya scriptures 

[Chorus: Remedy (Solomon Childs)] 
(Eh-yo, where you gon' run to? There's nowhere to hide) 
On some real live manhunt, take it in stride 
(We spit nothin but the real shit you bound to get hit) 
Takin off the with the torch once it's passed and lit 
(Eh-yo, where you gon' run to?) There's nowhere to hide 
(On some real live manhunt) Take it in stride 
(We spit nothin but the real shit) You bound to get hit 
(Takin off the with the torch) Once it's passed and lit </pre>
