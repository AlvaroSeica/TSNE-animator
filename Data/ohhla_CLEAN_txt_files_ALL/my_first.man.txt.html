[Murs]
I wanted her to grow up to be my soccer mom
The white girl that I shoulda took to prom

Her blond hair was just like sun rays
She took me far from the block with the gunplay

On Sunday, she would make me vegan food
And lots of other shit I'd probably never be into

When we travelled, I would be the only black person
Except the gay best friend, he was half-Persian

[Chrous]
And she truly was the apple of my eye
Never wanted her to ever leave my side
Miss America, American as apple pie
My first white girl, her first black guy
Pure love sent from the Most High
Racist bullshit came from both sides
My homies used to say she wasn't that fly
My first white girl, her first black guy

[Murs]
We used to go to fancy dinner with the folks
It would feel like the episode of Diff'rent Strokes

She smelled like a dog when her hair was wet
She said my hair felt like a Chia pet

She couldn't take much direct sunlight
Sunburn, no sex, not a fun night

Newsflash: white girls have ass too
And for some of you sistas, that's bad news

[Chorus]

[Murs]
I would yell and she'd never say a word back
She used the word "cock", I never heard that

We would get drunk off a ton of liquors
I say, "You white bitch!" and she cum quicker

She told me, don't believe the white lies
My dick was no bigger than the white guys

She look like Topenga from Boy Meets World
Her first black guy, my first white girl

[Chorus]</pre>
