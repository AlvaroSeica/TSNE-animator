[Intro: Kryme Life]
Yeah, Let me tell you something man
We got too many niggas out there flossÂ’n and flarge'n
Too many niggas wanna be like G's
They don't know they ABC's, Yaknowhatimsayin
Just tryna school yall niggas
Just tryna give yall niggas the game man
You'll fuck yourself up out there

[Kryme Life]
The streets aint for everybody that choose to roam em
Guns aint for everybody that choose to hold em
Cause you talk about drugs don't mean you sold em
Cause it's on the radio don't mean it got me open
I'm noticing a lot of fake niggas wanna step
Outta they shells, Wanna get beside they selves
Like they real, But they aint ring'n off like Johnson Pells
From the front line to the cells
How you figure that your scheme could affect my cream, (Never)
Buds is getting bigger, I project my dreams
I runs with ill niggas, Respect my team
To many niggas burn bridges, Play the opposite of clean, (Dirty)
I rely on S.I. to shut it down if I die, (Staten)
Let the hood know, I'ma hold it down if I fly
R.I.P. Notorious, Peace to Bed Sty, (Brooklyn)
D.I.P. that's bogus, That's New York pride
T.I.P. one of the best, Young fresh
Wordsmiths illest spitters out there yet
From an era where niggas put skills to the test
And will check ya, Come see the teacher at his desk
Class is in session for these boys we're school'n em
Now they take'n notes, Or they just doodle'n, (What)
Yo I don't think they know who they fool'n with, (Yeah)
I'll burn this motherfucker down for amusement
That's T.M.F., Toss more fire
If a nigga try to buy it it's gone cost more prior to my last LP
They last LP was tired, Before it dropped they needed some H.E
When I reck cut the check, Brother pay me
Since then I don't put up with these sucker emcees
Cause in a hot tic-toc he'll get his shit rocked
Twenty niggas mashed up, Lied to a flip box

[Chorus: Kryme Life]
Who put work in, Kryme Life hold'n it down
On the strip in the peniles or out of town
Who put work in, Kryme Life earned his stripes
Pound for pound, Round for round, When I spit it I make it count
Who put work in, Days, Nights, Hustlers struggle'n to get it right
I put work in, Believe I'ma put up a fight
For what I love I'ma jeopardize my life

[Kryme Life]
Man I'm going through my numbers
To show these weak niggas what work mean
I'm deep in the field tryna keep my shirt clean
Already came out with a few stains
But when you going hard, A nigga gotta charge it to the game
Wearing my war scars, Took pain like a soldier
It's my turn to give it, You niggas gonna fold up
In the kitchen we turn cocaine into boulders
On the block distribute what my team call cold crush
You snitch'n and I'm take your head off your shoulders
We paid attention when the OG's showed us how to rock
That's why we on top, And the plan is to stay there
It's my sand box you can't play here, Couple hand glocks
Aint talk'n ball courts when I say that I land shots
Stomach tied in knots, Sit'n in jail tryna think outside the box
How to make record sales and fans come to cop
See the transition from hugging on the block
Picture me in the studio dumping on these jocks
Yall niggas that's hate'n better lay low
Cause yo, Killers gonna move when I say so

[Chorus]</pre>
