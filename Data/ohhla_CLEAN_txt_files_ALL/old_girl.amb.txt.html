[Otis]
Girl, I see you lookin' at me and
Fuckin' me with your eyes, I'm like "Damn!"
I think I might have to take care of this bitch
But what's that moldy, crusty shit up on her lip? Aww, fuck it.

[Bonez Dubb]
Wrinkled ass bitch with dirty thoughts in her mind
I can roll with the hoe, but I won't be very kind
Gotta tell the truth, I really like her a lot.
Eventhough she's got a few bald spots, she kinda hot

[Otis]
This is my new chick
And she's the best to me
Only have a day and I'm already tappin' that pussy
I got raw in that yeast infection neden
Shit's frothy and foamin' like a tall glass of Guiness

[Bonez Dubb]
So sick from a number of VD's
And she's a trick from workin' on her knees
You see, and she's a trained pro
And always good for a fuck
The bitch lookin' like a skinny ass Jabba the Hut, she's so old!

[Chorus - 2X]
Old girl, I know you want this, love me
Girl, I know you want this love
Girl, I know you want this love me
Girl, I know you want this love!

[Phil Clinton]
Ah, ho ho. What do we have here? Looks like a party! Heh
Why don't you open them roastbeef curtains and let me in! HO!

[Bonez Dubb]
What the fuck, bitch? How you gonna do me like this?
I thought that we was in love, girl, so why you gotta trip?
All the sudden we can't fuck, now what the hell?
Rigor mortis is makin' your whole body all frail, so stale.

[Otis]
She's startin' to stink, OH MAN, that turns me on
Cleared the room when we walked into the highschool prom
We didn't stay long, one dance or two
Her neden reminds me of a history classroom, so fuckin' old!

[Bonez Dubb]
Please, baby, please, don't give up now
Just because I'm young, I'll still hit it like POW
And I like older chicks, about 200 plus
And somehow the worms haven't ate up all of your mouth, old ass!!

[Otis]
So the jig's up and she's fallin' apart
Her dead bodie's in pieces cause I fucked her so hard
She was suckin' my dick and she lost an eye
I cut her neden out and took it home to remember her by, it's all mine

[Chorus - 2X]
Old girl, I know you want this, love me
Girl, I know you want this love
Girl, I know you want this love me
Girl, I know you want this love!

[Hook - 2X]
When I first saw you, I knew you were mine

[Chorus - 6X]
Old girl, I know you want this, love me
Girl, I know you want this love
Girl, I know you want this love me
Girl, I know you want this love!

(Hook throughout)

[Phil Clinton]
Ah ho ho! That's how we do it! Might as well light up this cigar!</pre>
