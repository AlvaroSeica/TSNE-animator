(Intro) Chester P:
Taskforce, a hundred strong beats

(Verse One) Chester P:
I can't fight no more, this life's beat me
In times like this I wonder why was I chosen
I can't find no more, this life's beat me
In times like this I wonder why
Now's the best time for my enemies to get me
My sword lies broken and my gun barrels empty
I stand in the middle of a dangerous land
Without nuffink as defence except my bare hands
I'm gripping ryhmes in one and a mic in the other
Waiting for the forces that are trying to make m suffer
My power's at its weakest, my life's in the worlds grasp
In secret I hope the next days 'll be my last
I'm morbid and that's what all ways drives me to orbit
I find friendships awkward so who I'm gunna talk with?
I know my fam love me but emotionally I'm dead
Girlfriend I know you love me but you can't help my head
And I can't escape the nightmares or the day that follows
Or the pains of my present or yesterdays sorrows
So please try and understand these rhymes aint for you
And these are all my bad moves but I don't know what to do
Except declaire myself strengthless, waiting for attack
I'm stranded on these sands of earth without no maps, to follow
Or no compass to direct me
When my sword lies broken and my gun barrels empty

(Chorus)
My sword is broken and my gun barrels empty
My throats sore and my hands are all swollen
I can't fight no more this lifes beat me
In time's like this I wonder why was I chosen
My sword is broken and my gun barrels empty
My throats sore and my hands are all swollen
I can't fight no more this lifes beat me
In time's like this I wonder why

(Verse Two) Farma G:
Now's the best time for my enemies to get me
My sword lies broken and my gun barrels empty
Tortured by the pains of a thousand alcoholics
I die everyday in the sprays of poison bullets
My defence against loosing my head is smoking weed
And my head's been missing since around ninety-three
My mum holds me up and puts me back on track
I'm sent back, by images of how my dad collapsed
And I weren't there to help him through his pain he died alone
So now I cry down the phone to my ex-girl's home
We used to cry together and then I lost her too
So right now in my life Chester, it's me and you
We stand back to back for the attack we both fear
I relate to ya life bro, it's been the same for nuff years
Till I visited ya nightmares felt ya pain twice other
But there's nothin' you coulda done to prevent the murder
I'm crying for you my son and my mother
I'd put my blood first before any type of lover
And it's so hard to love, girls talk like man do
I don't trust myself, so there's no chance I'll trust you
Kill me when your ready, my enemies are heartless
No feeling for life when this one makes stress
I dive in the quicksand to end it all quickly
When my sword lies broken and my gun barrels empty

(Chorus)

(Outro) Chester P:
We're sending love to the other side
To Pete, Scott, Jason, Felipe, Sarah, Bill, Misa
And to all people on lockdown, Skinny Man
And any other humans serving time
Stay strong for yourselves
We know the fights hard and it's getting worse
It's nineteen ninety nine now, prepare for the millennium
