[Lounge Lo]
Where the dice game at? Who got the money up?
I got my niggaz who jack and kill, who got the gunny's up?
Big Face, cousin saw it, O.C.
And Uncle Turn is like, "Who's fuckin' with Mo B?"
Rhyme Rev, celeb called, this what he told me
"Just watch yaself, New York niggaz they hold E"
I've been in the game, so know what I'm in for
Yes, lord, yeah, mom, salute with a 10-4
Grabbed the blammer out of the bag, then I spin for
Bang, bang, bang, bang, all in ya friend's door
You're trying to the block now, "Why my mens for?"
And fuck all rappers not from Stat, I'm in for
I got that call, got Bloods that pop off
Bitches that talk shit and know Cristal loca
Fuck you joker, me I smoke her
And nobody wonder 'bout mostra nostra

[Chorus 2X: Lounge Lo]
It's the linger, it's the linger
Linger, lingerin', linger, lingerin'
Linger, lingerin', linger, lingerin'
Yes, yes, yes, yes...

[Lounge Lo]
I'm in the hood with this crack shit, guns and all
A wife beater, stacks a bit cuz my bums are small
But it's a small thing, little dudes, they run the hall
Tote big clips the size of Tim Duncan, tall
And y'all niggaz ain't Soul 4 Real
Hit the dice game, ass bet, take the cash, slide and peal
It's a must, when I'm rollin' the dice
Pusher pay, ass betters bet they life and tricks pay twice
Give or take twenty here, I'm into ya wife
Gettin' the word to where the Saints at with the softy white
Lounge Mode ain't the flossy type
I boss bitches, boss workers, so I'm the bossy type
Real talk like them cats in Queens
Got some niggaz Uptown, true story, where I catch my greens
And it's the lingerer lingerin', doin' his thingerin'
Slanger, I'm slangerin', bling bling, I'm bangin' 'em
Chino and Park Slow, niggaz, yeah I hang with them
Park Hill mothafuckas, that be my gang and them
Beezy Mode, fuck with B.I. gold
Green bags, shit, G.I. Joe
Get the heat from, P.L.O., hello, hello
Yeah, why you buggin' out? Yeah, P don't know
Del Pre walkin' the beat like we don't know
Staten Island niggaz shoot cops, the heat gon' blow
What the...

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
