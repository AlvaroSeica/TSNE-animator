[Chorus]
careful
be careful, careful
careful
I care for, care for you
careful
be careful, careful
you need to be careful

time's flying by
we ain't gettin' no younger
just started school
haven't seen you all summer
made some new friends
when I get back I can't wait to meet 'em
finish up in school
don't be a fool, always be a leader
somebody told me that now nobody can hold me back
the world is my home
the speaker's my phone
where you at
how you feel about music
I remember you rockin the mic
I shoulda filmed you
you ripped it yo
no I won't forget it though
haven't seen you in a minute
so I'm hopin' that you won't forget what I told you
do what you're supposed to
look what you're exposed to
it's all about who you know and who knows you
you need to be

[Chorus]
careful
be careful, careful
singer:
do you wanna be somewhere else
you're the only one who knows yourself... careful... care for you
careful
singer:
you're the only one who knows yourself... careful... care for you
you need to be careful
I care for, care for you

I know your type
always caught up in the hype
going out every night
trying to drink up everything in sight
it's your life right?
can't nobody tell you nothing, huh?
I see it on your face
who you think you hiding something from?
you're playing yourself
trying to grow up fast
fucking up in school
you don't even show up to class
running the streets with a gun under your seat
a bottle in your lap
where you think you're going with that?
heaven or hell
your future reads dead or in jail
another victim of the ghetto
another story to tell
another mother on her knees crying over her son
I tried to tell him but he wouldn't listen
now everybody miss him

[Chorus]
careful
be careful
singer:
do you wanna be someone else
careful
singer:
you're the only who knows yourself
be careful, careful
careful
careful
singer:
careful
you need to be careful

I tell you things you never heard
show you stuff you never
I'mma be the narrator in your dreams
walk with me through life and we can learn as we go
open up my book and take a look at the picture that I took wit'cha
feels like I'm still wit'cha
in a spiritual form
I hear it lives on forever
when a baby is born we carry it on together
???? live on through me and your family
I'm sorry ms. jackson
apartment number four
if you need anything just knock on my door
this goes out to anybody and everybody that could be touched
it's a six fourteen thing
we can save us

[Chorus]
careful
be careful
singer:
do you wanna be somewhere else
you need to be careful
singer:
you're the only one who knows yourself
I care for, care for you
careful
be careful
singer:
careful
you need to be careful
singer:
care for you
careful
be careful
singer:
care for you
you need to be careful
care for, care for you
careful
be careful
you need to be careful</pre>
