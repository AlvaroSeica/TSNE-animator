And they wonder why niggaz that made it
sounds so bitter on the record, why they filled with the hatred
Bumpin "The Minstrel Show" six years ago, damn they was sore
The critics said the angst, made the casual listeners short
Even I was like, "Dag, yo why they rappin so mad?"
But now I get it fam, bein overlooked is a drag
That's why I take seven years of bein resentful
Compose my instrumental, then I drop a classic album on you fags
But then... that's when the wack reviews come in
When they purposefully deduct a point or two from a ten
Like when... you hand in the perfect term paper
and the teacher takes away a point for writing in pen
It's the same thing cause everybody knows that D. Swain's king
but they act like he ain't hearin that he's not entertaining
They say he's self-absorbed and only talk about himself
Motherfucker I'm a rapper, what the FUCK is you saying?!!
 
It isn't easy bein everybody's secret
If underrated is a compliment, then keep it
If you support an artist, you should never keep it
to yourself and, nobody else (Tired of bein overlooked man, c'mon)

Yeah I give you my hits, with a personal twist
Put myself on Front St., this the thanks that I get??
I get it, you take my life and throw it square at my face
I'm only mentioned when you're lookin for a charity case
Give me eight and a half stars, hopin I'll disappear
A month later, twenty rappers emerge
and it's THEM you revere for doin the same shit, I did for years
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind, up in here, here, here...
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind, up in here, here, here...
Ask me would I press rewind? Nigga yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah...
 
Despite the pain and disappointments I've experienced
I still would do it all again, agaaaaaaain...

Ehh, I-I guess I can let this out the bag..
 
{beat changes}
 
[Danny!]
Yo, we one in the same
Went from burnin CD-Rs' now we runnin the game
Yo I used to sell these beats for 'bout a month and some change
Nonstop, just so I can cop some ones and a chain
and a stack of records, cause I'd rather mint these beats
So the process sorted like lather, rinse, repeat
"Yo it's gotta be more to life," I would say to myself
I ain't makin it for my health, man I wanna make a name for myself
I name my price and it was scarin 'em
So I had to low-ball, rap game was totalitarian
Finally found a decent asking price
Man it was so rough, I used to sell the same beat twice
Almost got my ass beat for that
They had a nigga writin everyone's receipt for that
Linked up with my nigga Ill Shawn from the gutter
We would be up in the studio 'til dawn, motherfucker
Makin classics, Shawn was in the zone with the mic
I provide 'em with the beats 'til that fateful night
I spit a verse, Shawn was like, "I didn't know you could write
Stick with me, and I promise you'll be straight for life"
After that, he was literally my biggest fan
We sold dope in our respective fields, that was the game plan
'Til his girl called me, told me that my boy got knocked
Drugs found, ratted on by some toy cop
They sent him upstate, now I'm back to square one
I had to trust fate, take my fuckin snare drums
and keep pushin with no days off
And Shawn would promise me that everything would soon pay off
