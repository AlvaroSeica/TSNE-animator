[Intro]
Yeah, Vinnie Paz, Jedi Mind Tricks
Percee P, Madlib~! Real fuckin deal baby
That's how we get down out here
Whattup Perce? (Whattup kid?)
Philly to Pazi projects, Bronx New York
(You know what it is)

[Vinnie Paz]
My guns are bigger than a baby's arm
With Agent Orange like I was raised in 'Nam
The bullets stay inside your brain like it's your favourite song
I don't give a fuck who they hittin they can graze your mom
I load the motherfuckin clip in they like baby bombs
I see it as somethin beautiful when the metal fly
Around the way call me Lucifer, a Hell of a guy
I'm a motherfuckin veteran I'm tellin you I'll
beat his head until there's red in them I'm lettin 'em die
City of brotherly thugs, the home of filthy living
You ain't fuckin around with Vinnie, Perce and Guilty Simpson
Unless you wanna be the target that we dump the clip in
I do the shit durin the day, I like the gun to glisten
You a backwards MUH'fucker, you run the prison
You think that being locked with males in jail a fun position
You should kill yourself, rapper and be stuck in the earth
To be honest ain't no rapper that can fuck with you Perce

[Chorus: Guilty Simpson]
For the cats in the hood with a rep
Hustle through the AM when most men slept
In the waistline where the roscoe's kept
I'm on the edge nigga watch yo' step
I'm on the edge nigga watch yo' step
We here to eat until there's no food left
In the waistline where the roscoe's kept
I'm on the edge nigga watch yo' step

[Percee P]
Fast or slow pace, my flow lace tracks, this cat'll throw bass
And don't waste steps and go chase broads to no place
Master streets, impress the freaks, pimps dressed for weeks
Hoes left to me I guess to cheat and test the sheets
Rippin shows from here to Britain yo I'm hitting hoes
Skippin those women that spliff and blow are not gettin dough
First degree, murder rhymes disturb your mind like urban lies
And quote only words of science of Percee P
Amateurs know they can't stand with the bro
My BrossAngeles flow cause damages
Most scandalous foes better handle it yo
I'm gettin that food, steady rippin black, spittin raps
Hittin cats for kickin whack lyrics to bitten tracks
My interviews say I sent a few lines to diminish crews
Some men'll do shit like bendin rules
Go for the kill I'll still finish you
I'm so hot we gotta close shop, you know not to open yo' spot
While I patrol blocks you gettin no props

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
I'm on the edge nigga watch yo' step {*4X*}

[Guilty Simpson]
Guilty Simpson, damage beyond word's descriptions
Rough verse inscriptions wrote by a cutthroat
Smoke in the alley where the young cats bust toast
Pinching pennies to pay up his truck note
My various techniques compare 'em to Jet Li
I'll chop with an AK and kick when it's payday
Let's see, how many men must test me
Deadly with a pen, let the rest be(ware/where)
face down in the playground six feet deep
in the sandbox when my right hand cocks
back on the hammer, you rest in peace
I play on whack cats when I bless the beats
Like priests in the Vatican he rattletattled and
sprayed up the vehicle your homeboy travelled in
Fuck the spots they brag about
We kick your front door way in and drag 'em out

[Chorus] + [Interlude to end]</pre>
