[Intro: King Just]
This ain't the movie
I've been waiting to inhale (word up)
It's been a long time (it's been a long time baby, but we here now)

[Chorus 2X: King Just (Shanti)]
Feels good to breathe again (you know you ain't right)
To see again (you know you ain't right)
To eat again (you know you ain't right)
(You know you ain't right, you know you ain't right)

[King Just]
I left the game alone, but the game didn't leave me
Cuz KJ fans want to hear my next CD
See me on TV, you can't Stevie Wonder
You wonder, how Underdog came from under
Beneath the surface, my wisdom was feeling worthless
Acting like, I ain't birth this
I ain't worth this, I ain't grab the mic and hurt this
For fun, and I, just begun
Obi Wan, son, show me some and I show many
That each and every rhyme of mine'll pack plenty
Master that twenty, that's when you first heard me
Hardcore, sophmore, let's get dirty
Bout to hit 30, and I'm bound to sell a mill
With a next record deal to feed the whole Park Hill
Oil spill, J.R. Ewing, still doing what he doing
You can't ruin, Who You'ing, I put two in
I leave four back, you need to fall back
This is KJ we talking about, right? Ya'll niggas ain't all that
Cop that, as soon it drop, for thinking my shit
Was gon' flop, hah! Stop the world or call the cops
Can he rock? Give him props, the naked gun, calling the shots
Cuz everything I spit is hot, say what?
Cuz everything I spit is hot

[Chorus 2X]

[King Just]
I was there when it started, there when it finished
Space cage age, take you to the outer limits
The scrimmage to preliminary, styles buried
And carry like Mariah on the Staten Island Ferry
Hurry, before you miss, what's going on
Worry, cuz KJ bout to perform
Curry, a nigga stay hot on the law
Bury, my adverseries who shit on my lawn
Gone like the winter til I return again
It's a new beginning of the end, I set trends
And recommend those follow, my Hennessey
Is my genie in a bottle, hit the pedal, full throttle
You'd rather play lotto with that last dollar
Cuz you ain't promised tomorrow, live another day, holla
Til ya lungs collapse, and you ask for it back
The breath of life, that kept you intact
Fact, not fiction, that's hip hop, they listen
Without the bling-bling, I still shine and I glisten
Listen to my self and earn my own wealth
Kraft pay for my shit to be on the shelf
The stealth you can't see or hear, when I come
Like I did on the last one, the Warrior's Drum
Say what? Like I did on the last one, the Warrior's Drum

[Chorus 2X] </pre>
