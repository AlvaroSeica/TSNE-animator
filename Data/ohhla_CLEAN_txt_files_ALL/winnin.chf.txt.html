[Chorus: Chief Keef]
I can't loose bitch, I'm so loose to winnin' (Bang, Bang)
Fuck with my family and you are finished (Bang, Bang)
And bitch we at the top, We so use to winnin'
Bodies gettin' dropped, we so used to winnin' (Bang, Bang)
Ridin' wit my niggas we be cursing tinted (Bang, Bang)
Catch up bitch, We so used to winnin' (Bang, Bang)
Everyday Double digits, We so used to winnin' (Bang, Bang)
Pull up and fire out some shots, We so used to winnin' (Bang, Bang)

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Sosa bout that gun smoke
Smoke kush smoke you don't know
Ridin' round wit my young niggas
Young niggas that's gone blow
Flow sick shit gold coast
Smoke grade A honor roll
Bad bitches by the bungalow
Real niggas honor those
Playing Louie I'm gang banging
Bad bitch twerk dancin'
Motherfuckas tryna play us
Its hoes and they sure now
Fuck with us and them guns blow
Gun ranges and gun shows
Rob you for your coco
Sosa Baby Uh Oh
Party rockin'
Ass shakin'
Anit throwin' money
I'm showin' money
Bitches dont deserve that
They be already goin' for me
300hunna, Young money, Foi, Gbe
2012 That's my year
Going crazy and see me

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
I can't loose bitch, I'm so loose to winnin' (Bang, Bang)
Fuck with my family and you are finished (Bang, Bang)
And bitch we at the top, We so use to winnin'
Bodies gettin' dropped, we so used to winnin' (Bang, Bang)
Ridin' wit my niggas we be cursing tinted (Bang, Bang)
Catch up bitch, We so used to winnin' (Bang, Bang)
Everyday Double digits, We so used to winnin' (Bang, Bang)
Pull up and fire out some shots, We so used to winnin' (Bang, Bang)

[Verse 2: King Louie]
Kush to strong with a thick bitch
She Like Chief keef and play his shit
When we ridin' smokin'
Type of shit like I'm logan and a piponet
My young g's stay iron holdin'
Pink champaign and some golden
New ray bandz let me unfold em
Just cashed out so I'm holdin'
Gotta lot of Nenes I be rollin'
Bitches pop pills like ibuprofen
Niggas say they ballin' but I be coachin'
Don't get bitched now nobody know'em
I be with young wild niggas I'd home
I love pussy but I prefer dome
Money come fast like my force phone
I pack loud smoking strechers long
Hit it call me shorty bird strechers on
I'm winnin' bitch I'm a champion
Pack louder than a ambulance
Money dance bitch hella bands
Just might cuff some F ends
Soon as they drop in advance
These niggas losing
No D, second chance

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
I can't loose bitch, I'm so loose to winnin' (Bang, Bang)
Fuck with my family and you are finished (Bang, Bang)
And bitch we at the top, We so use to winnin'
Bodies gettin' dropped, we so used to winnin' (Bang, Bang)
Ridin' wit my niggas we be cursing tinted (Bang, Bang)
Catch up bitch, We so used to winnin' (Bang, Bang)
Everyday Double digits, We so used to winnin' (Bang, Bang)
Pull up and fire out some shots, We so used to winnin' (Bang, Bang)</pre>
