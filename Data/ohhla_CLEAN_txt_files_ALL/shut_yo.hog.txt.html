(Intro)
Thugga!
We still servin and collectin these niggas man
Third time around mayn
Still representin this Texas shit
Comin down on fo's
Pop the trunk on boys

(Hook; screwed sample)
Bring them trill-trill
Bring them-bring them trill-trill
Bring them-bring them trill-trill to yo hood and shut'cho shit down
Bring them trill-trill
Bring them-bring them trill-trill
Bring them-bring them trill-trill to yo hood and shut'cho shit down

(Verse 1)
Now this that bottom of that map
Home of the candy paint on them 'Lacs
Ride real slow, sittin low on them fo's so I'm pokin the fifth wheel layin on back
Smoke my Black, tip my hat
Still gon talk it, still gon live it
Drop them screens, still ride clean, hang alright playboy we did it
Y'all don't get it? This our lane
Still gon swang, still gon bang
Piece and chain stil gon hang; Like my nuts on y'all mayn
Hold up, cigarillo full of the dro
Roll up, if you wanna move real slow
Pour up, came out hard comin down that 'vard
All I ever gotta do is show up
Blow what, grippin steel as I grip the wheel
That gal who wit me, she on the pill
I keep it pimpin, she know the trill
I bust a nut, she know the drill
I hit the scene, bitch I'm a star
Hell ya the rims mo' than the car
Still pullin boppers, still comin down
Them flyest nigga you'll ever find

(Hook; screwed sample)
Bring them trill-trill
Bring them-bring them trill-trill
Bring them-bring them trill-trill to yo hood and shut'cho shit down
Bring them trill-trill
Bring them-bring them trill-trill
Bring them-bring them trill-trill to yo hood and shut'cho shit down

(Verse 2)
Hold up, uh
And what y'all know about Texas
Land of the trill, young-young and the restless
Hand on the wheel, but my hungin is flexin
Insides lookin like I spent nine pents
In big 'Lac bout to crawl down Lexus
With a big thick redbone, hell I'm on
Real slick, you'll swear, want a quick pic
Deuce to my misfits passin by, paint like rich kid
If you lookin for the trill, well this it
Boss Hogg, you ain't even gotta ask
Ain't talkin bout cash, when the Prada I mash
Fire up the purp, no hash
Call shots like a senator, dance like a cinema
Girls, we all in that ass like a enema
And it's like ten of us, you wanna see the end of us
Keep waitin, keep hatin, you continue us
But'cha not, I be burnin rubber on spot
Pockets rockin on my stop, fat knots fill my Levi denims
Your dream cars, we ride in 'em
Bad broads, you see why we win 'em
I still mix pur-purple with my sprite
Two cups, I don't need no ice
Chad and Bun all in my day, and it's DJ Screw
Now she thank me twice

(Hook; screwed sample)
Bring them trill-trill
Bring them-bring them trill-trill
Bring them-bring them trill-trill to yo hood and shut'cho shit down
Bring them trill-trill
Bring them-bring them trill-trill
Bring them-bring them trill-trill to yo hood and shut'cho shit down

(Verse 3, Slim Thug)
Bone Thugga
Whole crowd go "hold up", when they see the boss man roll up
That's right, niggas get'cha dough up
I'll show ya boys out here how to show up
Leave a hater sick in his stomach, make him throw up
Pour up a fo', let's go sip
Blue long line, comin down like crips
Free Lil Boosie and my nigga named T.I.P.
Hop shotgun, I'ma take you for a trip
Come floss with the boss, I'ma take you to the north
Where slippers get got, and slippers get caught
Nigga robbed a nigga next door
Next day be like, look what I bought
Next list go, here take it to the south
See boys ridin with the candy red gloss
Bangin Z-Ro, know what I'm talkin bout
Niggas always talkin bout how we talk
Jockin our slang, see how we swang
Love them slabs comin down with the bang
You already know it's a Texas thang
Boys gettin rich off that cocaine, mayn
Layin gutter trill, still poppin purple seals
Still payin all my bills
Makin mills without a deal

(Hook; screwed sample)
Bring them trill-trill
Bring them-bring them trill-trill
Bring them-bring them trill-trill to yo hood and shut'cho shit down
Bring them trill-trill
Bring them-bring them trill-trill
Bring them-bring them trill-trill to yo hood and shut'cho shit down
Bring them trill-trill
Bring them-bring them trill-trill
Bring them-bring them trill-trill to yo hood and shut'cho shit down
Bring them trill-trill
Bring them-bring them trill-trill
Bring them-bring them trill-trill to yo hood and shut'cho shit down</pre>
