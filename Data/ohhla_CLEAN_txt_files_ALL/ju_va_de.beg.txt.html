Song:   Ju Va De (Deja Vu)
Typed by: Tha Masta

[Yukon Black]
The war Gods pull the cards for the barrage
Of stars, charge it with entourage
Walking on the clouds of deception
Start the crowds with reflection
Stand by, the cats eye, leaping counterattack
Iron Eagle sees a trap, flying sleeze of the rap
Around the projects for a wrap, I eat your soldiers for a snack
Rip your spine out your paperback
Draw a gap between your shoulder and a hole on your behalf
Monkey rolling with a staff, crack a cannister of gas
Then I vanish, to the past
Your crew is about as much use as .22 on bulletproof glass
Moving fast, like a leopard in pursuit
Pull the weapon from the boot
With perfection, execute
Here's a question, tell the truth
Mind a threat, better shoot, better shoot...

[Chorus: Long Axe]
Ju va de, ju va de...
Ju va de, ju va de...
Ju va de, ju va de...

[Long Axe]
I cover my lover with the clouds in the sky
People get by, everyday is justified
A parallel swell in the joint with the beat
Baby birds learn to fly, black babies know the streets
It's coming out my body like I'm making a speech
Know my own characters, emperors, the carriers
The creed, what eats is what pleads, godspeed
I've protected what I need, never bleeds, pardon me
Testies, over these companies, got disease
Bad company could make a good strive, start stumping me
Jade with the nectar, seed apple with the sector
Monkey spills the grapes so the wine tastes better
A time to absorb, redirect, open floors
Protect or open doors, all spoken through bloody wars
Then, it dawned on ya when ya soldiers is gone
Await, unaware of the ju va, ju va, ju va de

[Father Lord]
Black tiger, white crane, weeping mantis
Silver passage, got crystals, bright as this bronze stare
Golden abbotts, falty platinum on masses
Turning stone from glances, secret martial abbotts
But fast as dungeon masters, broken heart romances
Hair, tricky trances, laboratory cancers for City of Atlantis
Poision dances to kill 'em, oceans of blood spilling
One palm to murder, one palm to heal 'em
The poison serande, sounds that cascade
From the marshes that never bathe, pull styles from ice capades
My shoes were double blade, so extreme I swayed
Swords pulling to bake, the nowaday Bai Me
Empty force, I'm Kane, smack a glance, Wu Chi
Seen my Quran and what it mean to my dreams
Emotions disturbed in time like broken bottles of wine
The meditation refines so I kneal at the shrine
Better bring the abbott, may practice my bad habit
No matter, night and day, motherfuckers, I'm always at it

[Chorus: Long Axe]
Ju va de, ju va de...
The people in the future know what we say
Ju va de, ju va de...
The people in the future know what we say
Ju va de, ju va de...
Ju va de, ju va de...
Remember in the future, deja vu, ju va de...
Ju va de, de ja vu...
Remember in the future...
Ju va de, de ja vu...
Remember in the future...
I see that, I see that, I see that...
Ju va de, the future, remember in the future...</pre>
