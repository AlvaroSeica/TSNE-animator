Album:  Worldwide 2.0
Song:   Politaken
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus 2X: Popa Chief]
Fuck politicking, we politaken
Campaigning, move making, power lunching
Dirty urine, world touring, confidential
Move is made, another drug hit parade

[Popa Chief]
Read 'em and weep, another drug clean sweep
Up the party fahrenheit, with real shit my addicts like
I have not since yet to break a 'sweat' like Keith
Quiet as kept, everything I wisdom is the masterpiece
Blue movie nasty, he-he, black and ashy
Well known locally as well as internationally
I break sound barriers and kick down studio doors
Letting you know that mines is way nicer than yours
Make you shit your drawers, I bow, then pause
Then bounce, to the sounds of your whole crew's applause
Submit to be conquered, I leave nothing for the vultures
Chiseled my own path, and discovered drug
Like the new blunt, off the old blunt, and keep it moving
Like an ulcer, for the love of Dawaun, Jackie and Nadia

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
