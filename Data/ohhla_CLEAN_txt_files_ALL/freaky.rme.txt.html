Song:   Freaky
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[1st Verse]
Girl drop
Get low like ya just heard the groove pop
P pop, butterfly, booty bounce, peculator, pony ride, old school flip, do the mash potatoes
I don't care just look freaky
Yo man in the club who's so sneaky
Yo voice like ?? so squeaky
?? you Shaniqwa, Shardinae
All yall got stripper names baby we could play
But I got a clothin line
We specialize in lingerie
Walkin like you on a runway scrounge
For this performance I took my braids out
Man I'm killin this track until it fades out
Shake da bottle den release the cork
And let it spray out, spray dese broads down
Wet t-shirt contest
500 dollas to the momi wit the firmest breast
Yess

[Chorus]
Hachu I think I'm catchin the flu
Cuz you sick
Chicks get wet as soon as I spit
Freaky freaky freaky freaky freaky
Freaky freaky freaky freaky
Hachu I think I'm catchin the flu
Cuz you sick
Chicks go crazy when dey see my whip
Freaky freaky freaky freaky freaky
Freaky freaky freaky freaky
[Repeat Chorus]

[2nd verse]
If you too damn drunk den dis track will annoy you
Stop hatin on a true baller who'll employ you
All dese ladies wanna take me home
Guaranteed I aint leavin dis club alone
All dis ass in here think I aint getting some
Sippin on coke and rum getting numb
Momma shake it like a salt shaka
You and yo ying yang twinz
Im thug girl I aint tuckin my chain in
Why you wearin a fur mothafucka it's rainin
You look like a fool for girls what chu gamin
You should think about goin home and changing
Cadillac escalade what I get brains in
Rollin my eyes to the back of my head like I'm trippin on heron
Got my head on sped on
She got a chest like vivica
Booty like that chick on outkast video
Here come the hook here we go

[Repeat Chorus 2x]

[Guerilla Blacks Verse]
Got 300 dems got a few broads just be runnin nems
smellin like ??
not waitin in line just get pushed in yea we pushed in
Young Rome and Black got em gone offa Con and Yack
Pull up on got the crack oh!
Phat farm laced to the A-1
You kno a betta pimp
Naw it aint one
You and you get back stage
You and you get the gas faze
You and you way passed age
You right there you be nasty
Wanna creep wit me
Wanna freak wit me so frequently
You kno how G's be
The young guerilla wit the icy scrilla
Ma don't you kno I'm the illest

[Chorus]

[Omari]
