I started getting juicy when I saw what it does
Nevermind my tunnel vision and skin crawling with bugs
My pores start to hyperventilate, hypes of my mental state
Go psychodelic out of my skelleton to celebrate
This hell is great, rapidly tweeking to corpse with me
Then stumble the bundle, into the freezer like Walt Disney
Drain the liquid from me then stick my earths tummy
When I'm reborn you can't take shit from me

[Chorux x2]
Because they..
Because they..
Because they get to shine all night long..

[Tame One]
Unusual part of a funeral marks the musical dark
Moodkiller got full peaked bodybags of leak with smells reaking through
zippers
Morticians perscription striff, soaking peoples tuxidos to the bone
There's no place like a funeral home..
My newports get mummifed corpses dripping from horror
This is like diarrhea after the rigor mortis
Both lungs is spunges, with fluid like oil changing the Buick
Drowning but you still hearing that background music
I've seen you with the girl from The Ring
Raise hell at new well, fuck who you call
Sprinkle black magic like Voodoo dolls
Night of the living leak heads, dipping pot and cooking pot
I'm running off of Chris Thomas's watch
You can mourn the gone but what pump through my arms in the mourge
I can afford to purchase more and then smoke and then record

[Chorux x2]
Because they..
Because they..
Because they get to shine all night long..

My girlfriend walked in on me hacking my arm up
From my wrist to my pex, needless to say she's my ex
With no excuse for my behaviour, the razor's my acting agent
You say it's a cry for help, I say it's more like practice, ain't it?
All of my heroes been dead since I was two-zero
Instead of be in the fam my shrine's a mirror of meds
Cigarette sizzeling, smoking till my flesh wear diligence
Like long range missiles into Iraqi villages
Shotguns are the most succesable tickets to Haitis, kids
Rather be dead than the guy who raps about how great he is
One last fuck, cigarette and sipp on my lager
Then I'm gonna burn in hell with Kurt, BIG and my father

[Chorux x2]
Because they..
Because they..
Because they get to shine all night long..</pre>
