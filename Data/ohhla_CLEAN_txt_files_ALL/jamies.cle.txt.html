Typed by: @Cale_Sampson

[Chorus: Lori Nuic]
Miracles come true
When you least expect them
One might happen to you
Donât give up on love

[Verse One: Cale Sampson]
I broke up with a girl, were no longer together
Iâm contemplating, quitting music forever
Used to think it was my destiny, writing these songs
Maybe Iâve just been lying to myself all along
People say Iâm the sickest MC theyâve ever seen
But Iâm taking too long to get my album released
Itâs not cheap, thatâs why I keep going into debt
Trying to follow my dreams, and now my girlfriend left
So Iâm at my dadâs place, sleeping on the floor
Feeling depressed, the only place I can afford
I should just conform and be like more of my friends
Man Iâm getting too old to be starting over again
Trying to reverse my luck, what can I tell ya
Itâs like lifeâs raining on me and I got no umbrella
And I feel cornered, Iâm against the ropes
My only choice is to fight through and have a little hope
Iâve been walking with my head down, practically blind
Missing opportunities that were passing me by
Once you lift your head up, a new world appears
That you couldnât see before and everything becomes clear
If you stay strong through the darkness comes light
Thatâs what happened to me, I met the love of my life
When I wasnât expecting, a miracle occurred
Her name is Jamie and this song is for her

[Chorus: Lori Nuic]
Miracles come true
When you least expect them
One might happen to you
Donât give up on love

[Verse Two: Cale Sampson]
Now everythingâs gotten better, I moved in with my girl
Life is great, feels like Iâm on top of the world
Cuzâ the power of love defies obstacles
And it can make you believe anything is possible
And thereâs nothing, we canât achieve together
Like a team that just keeps getting stronger than ever
Sheâs down with the music, not consumed by wealth
And knows pursuing your dreams is what life is all about
So then I finally released my album
Couldnât believe it, a sold out show was the outcome
Had to pinch myself to make sure it was true
Man itâs amazing what a positive attitude can do
Thatâs why I smile when I go to bed at night
Sometimes I canât fall asleep, I feel great about my life
You can work towards your goals on your own and by yourself
But itâs more fulfilling when you can share them with someone else
I wonât forget driving that four wheeler
With Jamie on my back through the hills in Costa Rica
Or travelling to Paris, Lisbon, Venice
Thereâs many more to come, all our adventures are endless
Were meant for each other, like two soul mates
And the spark will still be there at the end of our days
Beautyâs only skin deep, so when our looks fade away
Iâll still be reading poems to her when Iâm old and Iâm gray
And I wrote this one here, to inspire all those
Whoâs hearts have been broken, who are losing their hope
When you least expect it, a miracle can come true
Donât ever give up on love, cuzâ this song is for you

[Chorus: Lori Nuic]
Miracles come true
When you least expect them
One might happen to you
Donât give up on love</pre>
