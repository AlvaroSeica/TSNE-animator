(Hook)
Got stuck between good and evil everyday
What I can, I can not say
I won't fight it anymore
I can't fight it anymore
Gotta keep my head high above the clouds
Cause when it's low it brings me down
I won't fight it anymore
I can't fight it anymore
Ohhhhh-ohhhh, ohhhh-ohhhhh
Ohhhhh-ohhhh, ohhhh-ohhhhh

(Verse 1)
Bite my tongue's all I did back in grade school
Back in class, I was smart but I played fool
And turnin felon at sixteen was so cool
Cause you don't know what you missin when they was broke too
And I'm stuck (Between good and evil everyday)
Some of my favorite rappers told me that crime pay
I'm glad I learned not to follow what every rhyme say
I gotta always have a do what's right, mindstate
I promise (I won't fight it anymore)
And why should I, well damn it how could I
If I don't trust me, then how will I know how good I-
Ever could be, just a G in the hood, high
They told me keep it real, forever rep ya clique
For every whoopin don't deserve the same size, switch
I pray to know the difference, and never lose sight
I told my brother only keep it real when it's right
He told me

(Hook)
Got stuck between good and evil everyday
What I can, I can not say
I won't fight it anymore
I can't fight it anymore

(Verse 2)
I'm feelin like I can take on the whole planet, can't nobody stop me
These haters wanna see me fail, well damn it they can watch me
From the paparazzi, seventy, come back like it's Rocky
And no I'm not Apollo creed, I'm more like El Mariachi
A desperado wake and sauce
And all this ain't Versaci
My word and my balls all I got, you think I'm cocky
But never mind, I came to grind
I'm thinkin like a ponzi-
Scheme when I flip my cheese and swisher sweet to broccoli
We hotter than hibachi, super crunchy Saki
Patience and persistence what my grandpapa taught me
Somebody musta put me here to break up the monotony 
I humbly decline to be the boss, it's way to costly

(Hook)
Got stuck between good and evil everyday
What I can, I can not say
I won't fight it anymore
I can't fight it anymore

(Verse 3)
Heeeeeeeeyyyy
Prayer, mama say there's power in it
Pain, God is how she deal with it
Struggle, she wanted better for her children
Hustle, that ain't the way Jesus did it
Violence, Martin Luther woulda been against it
Fellow man, the Beatles made us all feel it
Within, that's where you gotta have it
Or bendin in, ask God and you shall have it
Trials, that's just a test of your faith
Vow, to talk with him all the way
Thirst, to want what I work for
Sustain, to show you what I'm made of

(Hook)
Got stuck between good and evil everyday
What I can, I can not say
I won't fight it anymore
I can't fight it anymore
Gotta keep my head high above the clouds
Cause when it's low it brings me down
I won't fight it anymore
I can't fight it anymore
Ohhhhh-ohhhh, ohhhh-ohhhhh
Ohhhhh-ohhhh, ohhhh-ohhhhh

Got stuck between good and evil everyday
What I can, I can not say
I won't fight it anymore
I can't fight it anymore
Gotta keep my head high above the clouds
Cause when it's low it brings me down
I won't fight it anymore
I can't fight it anymore
Ohhhhh-ohhhh, ohhhh-ohhhhh
Ohhhhh-ohhhh, ohhhh-ohhhhh</pre>
