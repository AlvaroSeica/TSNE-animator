Album:  Insurrection
Song:   Rather Serious
Typed by: King Kane

[The Reverend William Burk]
If you put the rotation of the earth in reverse
And took me back to the verse to spark the first hunger and thirst
Then Burk could be a curse for all the MCs who spit the worst rhymes
And worst lines at worst times and try to shine but fail
Miserably, because they pitifully follow trends
And don't repent for their sins against the men of a higher caliber
All these amateurs with low stamina, and weak grammar from the borders of Canada
Down to Alabama, there's an MC who thinks he can get within my perimeter
They end up bein' janitors or muggin' for the cameras
At state pen', marvelous like crops and harvest
I'mma marry a Goddess and live the largest
Regardless of the fact that I'm a hip hop artist
I don't have to be the hardest, just the smartest
And travel the farthest, thoughts where hip hop bottom is
So it's proposterous for you to try to battle this lyricist with fiery sentences

[Chorus: Shaki]
We take this rather serious
And we never front on the realness
We'll never stop 'till our work is done
And our job is to make y'all feel this
We take this rather serious
And we never front on the realness
To try to go against is delirious
And a war would just be senseless

[The Reverend William Burk]
This amazin' invasion, a blazin' sensational rhythm
Is stronger than venom, rugged as denim
Never the minimum, emblem of the B sign
More popular than Peace signs
Take the world by storm and perform in order to the free minds
I've traveled and battled and rattled the gravular verse
In the universe formed when the Big Bang burst
My verse'll touch hearts and turn ducks to black nationalists
Sisters wearin' weaves and fake nails'll know they're Africans
Brothers once emotionless as mannequins hear these lyrics
And take action for collective satisfaction
We leave the world panickin', and it's not an accident
We represent, passionate, militant, we killin' it
You think you deep, dun, I'm bottomless
It's obvious, I rock the metropolis
With conscious slang that's marvelous
My thoughts are heavy as hippopotamuses
I'm hot as saunas is, honor this lyricist
Writin' ever since genesis
My innovation is the formation of constellations
All in creation remains in constant rotation
The basic foundation, look the ancestors for motivation
Despite imitation you can never pull off a duplication

[Chorus]

[The Reverend William Burk]
My army is in harmony, lyrical prophecy
Honestly, microphone weaponry swings in custom MC armory
Take over the economy, make more money than Carnegie
And live inside a mansion so noone can bother me
I rhyme and heal the world, so Godly, mahagony ideology
With African psychology, Egyptology, consciously
Words rough like herbs, take a pop of (?)
I take orders and serve to relax and calm your nerves
Straight up and down, no jokin' around
My sound is well renowned and anyone to test drops to the ground
You either want more, you want war when I step on to the floor
With this lethal venomous hardcore, deep as the sea for sure
Rhymes are pure, guaranteed to kill ya ills
Numb ya pain, straight from the brain like pills of Advils
Spill this fluid when we do it, if you better than me prove it
Because my language is hip hop and I'm fluent
My angle is untamable, the fatal black angel
I strangle weak MCs and leave the microphone to dangle
Rockin' stable as a newborn baby inside the cradle
So my money multiplies at the rate of the times tables
Buy myself a mansion in Florida's Coral Gables
Bein' entertained by women with the most beautiful navels
In the music business on at least five or six labels
I'm free and teach the world to receive mad appraisal

[Chorus] x2

[Outro: Shaki]
We gonn' keep it movin' and we never gonna stop
And it's never gonna quit, and it's never gonna finish
Because we gonn' keep it movin' and we never gonna stop
And it's never gonna quit, and it's never gonna finish
Because we gonn' keep it movin' and we never gonna stop
And it's never gonna quit, and it's never gonna finish
Because we gonn' keep it movin' and we never gonna stop
And it's never gonna quit, and it's never gonna finish
Because we gonn' keep it movin' and we never gonna stop
We gonn' keep it movin' and it's never gonna stop
It's never gonna finish, it's never gonna stop
We gonn' keep it movin' and we never gonna stop
And it's never gonna quit, and it's never gonna finish</pre>
