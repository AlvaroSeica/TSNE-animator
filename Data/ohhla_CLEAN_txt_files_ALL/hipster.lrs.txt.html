Hipster girl: So check this
I just read the Pitchfork review of the new Pavement reissue
Stephen Malkumus is a genius
but let's face it, he's no Conor Oberst. I'm just saying
It's not 1994 anymore, duh. Did I show you my new mini skirt/leggings combo?
You know what they say: ugly IS the new hot

I met her in the thrift shop bumping indie hip-hop
Calculator wrist watch, Shins t-shirt and flip-flops
Queen of the hipster scene, straight out of Vice Magazine
Social outcast at 16 but now she lives her BoHo Dream
She came from Omaha to Williamsburg
She loved Karen O and she had heard
That Brooklyn was the hipster mecca
Packed her bags with her friend Rebecca
Said she had a thing for broke dudes in bands
Who lived by Union or by Grand
So we went down to the Bedford Bar
And bought a six dollar PBR

Hipster girl: Ezra. Go down Bedford, take a right on Metropolitan
then a right on Union, and then you're here
Just text me when you get here okay?

[Chorus]
Hipster girl
Cool by the numbers and she rocks my world
Knows all the indie bands you've never heard
She's my hipster girl

She thinks uncool stuff is mad cool, indie culture's fad rule
But cool stuff is uncool, right? That's why Friday's Jewel night
She reads books no one has read, laughs at jokes no one has said
So ironic with her taste, her whole life is cut and paste
It's a metrosexual romance, she wears my shirts and I wear her pants
We play dodge ball, kid sports are cool
Watching Spank Rock and McCarren Park Pool
She's my trust fund baby bohemian, her vegan hummus keeps her thin,
I love my L-Train girl it's true, she always goes down on the weekends too

Hipster girl: By the way
that pro-Bush shirt you're wearing is making me really uncomfortable
you may be wearing it ironically
but that doesn't give you the license to be obnoxious
you look like a hardcore fascist redneck!

[Chorus]
Hipster girl
Cool by the numbers and she rocks my world
Knows all the indie bands you've never heard
She's my hipster girl

BRIDGE:
Donnie Darko makes no sense!
Hipster girl: When did side-pony tails get cool again?
Your fixed-gear bike makes no sense!
Hipster girl: I've been trying to do that dirty-chic thing, you know?
Donnie Darko makes no sense!
Hipster girl: I am so BoHo right now
L train girls don't make sense (I don't get it, I don't get it)

Hipster girl
Cool by the numbers and she rocks my world
Knows all the indie bands you've never heard
She's my hipster girl

Hipster girl
She's got her latte and some spoken word
Ironic statements on her vintage shirts
She's my hipster girl

Hipster girl: I'll give it to you, Napoleon Dynamite was funny
but "Vote for Pedro" t-shirts at Wal-Mart? What are they thinking
Wal-Mart is evil. Their health care is totally inadequate
Didn't you see the screening
of that Robert Greenwald movie at Pete's Candy Store? It was so sad
What is with all of these hipsters taking over Williamsburg?</pre>
