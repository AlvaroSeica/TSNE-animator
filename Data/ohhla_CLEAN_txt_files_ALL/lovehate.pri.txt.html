Love Love to be a Player

I'm in the right mode, real bold untold riches in my pocket
Well you heard my rhymes you seen my pictures
Bitches see me, they wanna be me
And all the brothers run to them cuz they can't reach me
For real maybe I'm magic, everyone David Coppafeel
Automatically grab it
Diva Don't fuss believe me, you built like a bus
I'm a jump you like Kneival in a rush, please
I got a Ph.D a playa hatin degree when it ain't me check me
University teach class dispatch grade D my Keats kick you in the Balzac
Alls that so wack, hiphop hits gone bad, but that brag dag, it's temptin
Money Cash Hoes let me kick a little somethin
I can put the ho back in hotel, write, win a Nobel, run wit the cartel
Rock? Well I rock well, slam like a Montel, fat eat a Snackwell
Smack like a Bonne Bell
Talk with the tic tac on the Startac wait hate that
It's Rap gettin tired
Booty Call of the Wild -I'm snorin
Like Hootie all of a sudden-borin
You Don't Blowfish? Hmm..Let me finish, I'm a step wit
Someone on the right tip the right shit, the champ sip
Trap for the flip hit Billboard shit
Damn I did it (what for?)
Connect 4, pretty sneaky sis, gimme some more
Cuz this Cracker needs a Jack , need some caramel in the back
And since you askin lick me like Baskin
Like you Robbin cream/where you been?
Multitask my ass like computer blue Year 2
Oh no shoot, Hal's gone crazy, Amazing, Grace
Like Jones I'm a giant, Body Y-2-K compliant
Please, I'm ready for 3 grand
Cryogenic freeze, I'm the nations gift for future man
No frozen skeeze jokes, Ya'all shut up

I love to be a Player
I hate to be a Player, worse I hate to relay it

You better run for cover
Last tango with the lover, get the butter
See my vest !see my vest!
Take it off see my chest (Doh!)
I confess boy I'll house you
Break you off a little I'm about to astound you
Always ill on Principal like Victoria
got a pimple shit now I'm borin ya
Braggadacio should just be a font
Tired of players, playa haters, playa songs
It's time to innovate, elevate the music
I can solve a Rubix, bounce my boobies
Can't stop it, constant I'd better get a grip
A-4 You sunk my Battleship
Mackin it but fight back and hit Chaka and the Sleezestacks
We really need that
Time to succumb, drop the "succ" time to cum
Put the suck back in make you cum again
You'll comprehend
If you want to be my lover
Stay the fuck away from my friends</pre>
