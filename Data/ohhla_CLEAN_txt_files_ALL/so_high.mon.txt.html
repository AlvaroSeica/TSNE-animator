Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Painting these lyrics from a hammock, with an ounce of kush a pack of bamboos
And an ice cream sandwich I'm that dude
Game given to you from an OG point of view
Usually I'll sell it but I got enough to share with you
Baby if you cook and roll that weed I'll be so happy with you
Fuck you so good you'll know I'm cheating it won't matter to you
You know how daddy do you spitta make them jet maneuvers
Hop of the club don't park valet won't get a chance to move it
I'm out before I hear the music that's how quick them hoes be choosing
I don't call it, pussy be crawling to me
Homeboy I don't know who did what, cause I was in the cut
Rolling tropical..sitting low as possible

[Chorus: French Montana]
Relaxed in the sun, low as possible
Relaxed in the sun, low as possible
Relaxed in the sun, low as possible
Relaxed in the sun, low as possible

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Shorty pussy be the meanest, I be balling all arenas
Homie high somewhere in venus, I mean this
When I tell you that I want it, I don't need it
They be all in the procedures, Shorty yelling from the bleachers
Got me reachin' like a 2 guard, too hard. Ski Mask or a suit on
5 chains canaries help me cool off, tuned up
Camaro like Larry Flint, Block-star, Rockstar
Montana Aerosmith, 40 spit
Homie nigga's dying I'll be flyin' out
Fed's on my nigga's tail he hidin' out
Montana slidin' out
Baby don't be fuckin' with my high
Suck a nigga dry
I'll be low as possible, tryna clear my mind
Montana Bitch!

[Chorus Repeated]</pre>
