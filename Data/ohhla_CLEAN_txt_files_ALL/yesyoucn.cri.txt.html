Intro (Young Gully):

Yeah, Gully, Cristiles, Dre' B, YH

Keep risin', keep prevailin'

Verse 1 (Cristiles):Â 

You ever feel like the world's against you?
you can tell nobody like you and they just pretend to?
you can tell they wanna fight you but they never say shit?
I'm lookin' evil in the eyes, but its hard to face it
money's runnin', before I catch it I gotta chase it
see the lies in the eyes of a man who's not a racist
treatin' me like I'm stupid but nah I'm not as basic
if a Mexican want respect then they gotta take it
see they said that I would fail so I must prevail
I got a story how I never gave a fuck to tell
meanin' nah this wasn't luck, I was stuck in hell
charged with a felony tellin' me I'd be stuck in jail
I'm in the lab with Gully remeniscin' on pain
from different cities but the struggle we mention the same
if gettin' up after they fall is a measure of men
then will I stop standin' tall? nah, never again
cause'

Chorus (Dre' B):

Sometimes you feel, like you just can't
but deep down you know, that really yes you can
people gon' hate, but still you try
'cause deep down you know, that really yes you can

Verse 2 (Young Gully):

Never quit, keep grindin', one day at a time
the storm is beginnin' to calm you can say that's a sign
seen so much drama I used to pray I was blind
memories of misery they still play in my mind
had to climb to the top, came from the bottom
where cops will kill a man but won't explain why they shot him
it feels like I can never get away from the problems
some hope I fall like the weather when it rains down in autumn/ yeah
and even when nobody respected my hustle
and I was trapped knee deep in the depths of the struggle
I kept it movin', I started progressin' and bubbled
I got my money up I took no exceptions then doubled
I'm livin' proof that you can rise up above the pain
through all the setbacks you inherit and the judgement game
people wanna see me fail man it's such a shame
but if you say you can you will, and that doesn't change

Chorus (Dre' B):

Sometimes you feel, like you just can't
but deep down you know, that really yes you can
people gon' hate, but still you try
'cause deep down you know, that really yes you can/ x2
