[Chorus]
Pushing rhymes underground like moonshine
with jump like juke joints, ride like old 'Lacs
Down like four flats, shine like gold grills
Curls and chrome rims, bitch, you know what it is, I'm
Live from the underground, underground
Live from the underground, underground
Underground, underground
Live from the underground railroad

[Big K.R.I.T.]
My poppa told me get paper, motherfuck a hater
Them Js look clean son, but elevate to gators
I took that shit to heart, plus I dug it like a crater
I'm giving out game player, are there any takers?
While you was quarter sacking, I was quarterbacking
Calling plays every day, level All-Madden
High five, cloud nine, private jet lacking
Treat the seal like a vinyl record, gotta keep it cracking
Shall I pour up? Blow some smoke up, get my spit on
Grab a paper, sit on a track and get my shit on
Ice cold water with the flow minus the lemon
I'm Cinematic Multi, what label you been on?
Old school ride, flicking ashes in the tray
Smoking up the booth, blowing static in they face
C.R.E.A.M., cash rules everything around me
King, checker board nigga, go and crown me

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Keep it rolled, I'm supposed to lose control
Oh no, pop the trunk, burn a skunk and slam a do', do', do'
Window crack on the ave, marinate the scene
When I lean and crawl, couldn't see me with your high beams
Play my part, I got heart, I'm tailor gator sharp
Plus we sit taller than monster trucks in them trailer parks
Ride candy coated, it cost a grip, but I had to blow it
Insides was rusty, my seats is bucket, but you'll never know it
Forever tinted, so you can't peep while your bitch up in it
You call her phone, she give you tone like, why you tripping?
Cold blooded ain't it, but that's how it be when they want that cash
When you ain't around, anybody could be in that ass
Heard that from 8Ball homeboy girlfriend
If she a bopper, then she probably ain't your girl then
You claim you pimping, don't be tricking, wear a curl then
And find some paint to throw some swirls in

[Chorus]

[Outro - repeat to end]
We going live, from the underground
From the underground
From the underground</pre>
