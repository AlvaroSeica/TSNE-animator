Yo, let me tell you 'bout this dream I had
I woke up in some weird scientist's lab
Standin next to a dude in a white coat
It had X. Light on his pocket protector
Had this big blue helmet on
And a big cannon in place of my right arm
He said, 'Mega Ran, what you don't remember me?
The power charge must have took some of your memory
We gotta go, Wily's got another plan'
Man who are you, what happened to my right hand?
The Doc said, 'I got no time to explain
This isn't a joke, no time for the games'
Yo, this all remind me of a game I played
Back when I was a young boy, like 5th grade
Step outside and the sky's all pink
Explosions everywhere make it hard to think
'Thought I could trust Wily, but I shoulda known'
Then over the horizon, I spot a big dome
The Doc said, 'That's it, yeah right there!'
That's what? 'Dr. Wily's secret lair!'
'He's got 8 bosses you gotta beat first'
'And when you find Wily, make him eat dirt~!'
'I brought a few weapons for your protection'
And this is the beginning of the Mega Ran legend
But I got a question
(And this is the beginning of the Mega Ran legend)
What am I doing here? Who are you?
What do you want me to do?
This is weird man

{Still seems more like a cheap B movie to me!}</pre>
