[Intro: Tommy Whispers]
Uhh, Let's Go, Fuck writing shit down
I'ma just go in the booth and just do what I like to do
(Zone Out, Zone Out, Zone Out)
Getting that money, Shit was right, All night, All night, All night
Yeah, I know I had to get that money, Getting that money, Money, Money
Money makes the world go round that's what they say
Money makes the world go round that's what they say

[Tommy Whispers]
All praises due to the mic, Influenced by life
Generals and hustlers losing they stripes
Turn to the young product, And be using the white
Flicking they Bic lighters hard and be hitting that pipe
You got to live right to get right, You wanna pop off then get hype
I get nice, Then smooth it out like Kahlua's on ice
It's a fifty-fifty gamble like you shooting the dice
Lets get rich, I progressed after each and every flip
The projects, I got money on each and every strip
My comrade got knocked off and hit with six
To twelve, Now my nigga live'n in Hell
Bid in the cells, Now my love is written in mails
Send you a kite, C. Rule goddamn I miss you
My little young physical, Super suave and buck tooth
I run through kicking up swift like kung-fu

[Hook 2X: Tommy Whispers]
Zone Out, Zone Out, Zone Out, Zone Out

[Tommy Whispers]
Shame on me, I gotta put the blame on me
For letting some dumb bitch get away with a G
Caught slipping, You this dope game is much different
When they get to naw'n and itch'n, They all get the sicking
No description, Masked up sitting in the kitchen
Your family's missing, And the phone's off the hook
Somebody's getting juxed, Cause you dealing with crooks
Apprehend em, Send em to the E.R. with lead in em
Be replacing things you facing a King
Animals, Wild guerrillas, Get placed in a bing
It's a dirty game, Inflame a hammer or ring
Shoot to kill, Everyday life is real
In the field, Where cops even pop they steel
You can't chill, The block's more hot then Brazil

[Hook]

[Tommy Whispers]
I clutch my fist around the mic, And then I spit with fury
I'm a growing epidemics Doc, And you can't cure me
You can put me in any jail or hood and I won't worry
Nigga wanna play ox tail I'll cook the beef with curry
I'm from across the bridge doggie bone, This is Jersey
I'm form Staten Isle roadie where we get dirty
Muck kicks from the tre-eight that ate your face
And I don't talk very much, Shit I don't do business well either
If I feel you winning then I'ma rob ya, I'm a cheater
What you expect from a project with the hyenas
The rat packs and the lion heads that smoke reefer
Tryna dodge the police, Poachers that sell heaters
Tranquilize us then beat us down with chrome ninas
Lock us in cage put up signs say'n don't feed us
We just animals getting hunt down by the cannibals
The Hannibal Lecters, Yo this is a lecture

[Hook]
