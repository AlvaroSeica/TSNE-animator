[Intro: Ice-T]
Yo, check this out
A lot of people be getting mad cause I use the word nigga
You know what I'm saying?
They don't like the fact that I use the word nigga
They say you're a black man
Yo, I tell them I'm a nigga they don't understand that
So I'm a say what I wanna say
I call myself, what I wanna call myself, you know what I'm saying?
So they need stay off my DICK!!, you know

[Verse One: Ice-T]
Damn right I'm a nigga, and I don't care what you are
Cause I'm a Capital N-I double-G-E-R
Black people might get mad cause they don't see
That they're looked upon as a nigga just like me
I'm a nigga, not a Colored man or a Black
Or a Negro or an Afro American, I'm all that
Yes, I was born in America true
Does South Central look like America to you?
I'm a nigga, a stand up nigga from a hard school
Whatever you are, I don't care, that is you fool
I'm loud and proud well endowed with the big beef
Out on the corner, I hang out like a horse thief
So you can call me dumb or crazy
Ignorant, stupid, inferior or lazy
Silly or foolish but I'm badder and bigger
And most of all; I'm a straight up nigga

[Break: Ice-T]
That's right I'm a nigga, you know what I'm saying?
My man Lord Finesse is my motherfucking nigga
You know, Evil E's my nigga, Islam's my nigga
That's right they're my niggaz

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
I'm a nigga in America, and that much I flaunt
Cause when I see what I like, yo I take what I want
I'm not the only one, that's why I'm not bitter
Cause everybody is a nigga to a nigga!
America was stole from the Indians show and prove
What was that? - a straight up nigga move
A low down shame, yo it's straight insane
Yet they complain when a nigga snatches their gold chains
What is a nigga suppose to do?
Wait around for a handout from a nigga like you?
That's why a low down nigga gets hype
But I'm not a nigga of that type
I'm a steak and lobster eating, and Billionaire meeting
And Cash money making and moving and shaking
Corporate jet gliding and Limousine riding
Writing hits, filthy rich, straight up nigga!

[Break: Ice-T]
That's right I'm a nigga

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
Now I'm a write this song though the radio won't play it
But I got Freedom Of Speech so I'm a say it
She wanna be les', he wanna be gay
Well that's your business I'm straight, so nigga have it your way
Those who hate me, I got something for ya
I'm a nigga with cash, a nigga with a lawyer
Not a watermelon chilling, eating down south
But a nigga that will smack the taste from your mouth
A contemplating, thinking, best champagne drinking
Ten inch giving, extra large living
Mercedes Benz driving, striving to surviving
All the way live and, kicking Hi-five and
Stroking and rapping, happening and deal doing
Fly in from Cali' to chill with the crewing
Criming and grooving, and fly girlie grabbing
Horny gun shooting and long hair having nigga

[Break: Ice-T]
Straight up nigga, nigga
Straight up nigga, nigga

[Verse Four: Ice-T]
Nigga, that's right fool look at me
Just that kind of nigga you'd like to hang from a tree
But all you KKK type grave diggers
Ease back fool, cause I'm a trigger nigga
I work real hard for my living
But I don't celebrate bullshit thanksgiving
Sit up like some fool and eat turkey
That's the day your forefathers jerked me
Shipped us all over here in locks and chains
Split us up, twisted up a nigga's brain
Now you keep me in constant sweat
But I'm a nigga that you'll never forget
A black bad, iron clad, always mad
Fly nigga, taking off from a helipad
Rolex styling, buck wilding, cap piling
Sporting link chinks and medallions
Intellectual, hi-tech cash, and seven digit checks
And still breaking necks
The ultimate male supreme, white woman's dream
Big dick, straight up nigga

[Outro:]
[DJ Aladdin] Yo Ice, my nigga
[MC   Ice-T] Yo what's up loc?
Just had to tell niggaz what time it was Aladdin man, you know..
[DJ Aladdin] Yeah, I hear you homie
[White Cop:] Look at those fucking niggerrrrs (*6 Gun Shots*)
[MC   Ice-T] We don't play that shit!</pre>
