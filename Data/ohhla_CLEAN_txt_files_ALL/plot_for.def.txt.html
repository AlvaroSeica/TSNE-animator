People in the city get 
They try to treat you like an idiot
Try to hate us (try to play us)
Rock for a little bit
Buck for a little bit
Make it contagious (make it outrageous)
I'm outraged by the way they came
If they try to change us (they try to rename it)
You wanna see a fix
You get the CD, it's Tuck You In for Your Ride (go ahead play it)

Look at the way I say it, play it, out right lazy (go and say it)
Rebel to conformity 
Rivals gonna like more of me

I'm not saying my body is shameless
And I'm not saying (I'm laying with Satan) 
You can be a lame MC, if you stay the same degree 
Blaze and burn hopelessly 
Really can't save ya
