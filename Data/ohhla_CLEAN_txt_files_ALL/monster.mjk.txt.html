[*Michael Jackson ad libs for first 30 seconds*]

[Verse 1 - Michael Jackson]
You can look at them comin out the walls
You can look at them climbin out the bushes
You can find them when the letters' about to fall
He be waitin with his camera on focus
Everywhere you seem to turn, there's a monster
When you look up in the air, there's a monster
Paparazzi got you scared like a monster, monster, monster

[Break - Michael Jackson]
(Too bad), oh oh, Hollywood, has got you jumpin like you should
(Too bad), it's got you bouncin "Off The Wall"
It's got you drunk enough to fall (drunk enough to fall)
(Too bad), oh oh, Hollywood, just look in the mirror
And tell me you like, don't you, don't you like it?

[Chorus - Michael Jackson]
Monster, he's a monster, he's an animal
Monster (yeah), he's a monster, he's an animal (oo-oh)

[Verse 2 - Michael Jackson]
He's comin at ya, comin at ya rather too fast
Mama say, mama got you in a zig zag
And you're runnin and you're runnin just to escape it
But they're gunnin for the money, so they fake it
Everywhere you seem to turn, there's a monster
When you look up in the air, there's a monster
Or when you see them in the street, there's a monster, monster, monster

[Break - Michael Jackson]
(Too bad), oh oh, (Hollywood) has got you jumpin (like you should)
It's got you bouncin "Off The Wall"
It's got you drunk enough to fall
(Too bad), oh oh, Hollywood, just look in the mirror
And tell me ya like, what ya see

[Chorus - Michael Jackson]
Monster (he's like an animal), he's a monster (just like an animal), he's an animal
(And he's movin in the air)
Monster, he's a monster, he's an animal (everybody wanna be a star, oo-ooh)

[Break - Michael Jackson]
Why are they (why are they), never satisfied (satisified)
with and all you give? (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You give them your all, they're watchin you fall
And they eat your soul (like a vegetable)

[Verse 3 - 50 Cent]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Catch me in a bad mood, flippin, you'll take a whippin (ha!)
Animal, Hannibal, cannibal addition
Tears appear, yeah, blurrin your vision
Fear in the air, screamin, your blood drippin (ooh!)
Shiver a second, now, now, now, what is it? (ha!)
Funerals, cemeteries, don't worry it's time to visit
Broke bones, tombstones, how do you think I'm kiddin?
It's home, sweet home, the land of the forbidden (ooh!)
All hail, run tell, the King has risen (ha!)
2010 +Thriller+, there's nothin iller, it's killer
Their vision, they miss 'em won't impact, this is that
It's the bomb, ring the alarm, MJ number one (ooh!)
It goes on and on, it goes on and on (ha!)
We get to creepin and crawlin, in the early morn' (ha! ha!)
Dream on dreamer, there's nowhere to run, you can try but you're done
I can feel it in the air, here the monster come

[Break - Michael Jackson]
(Too bad), oh oh, Hollywood has got you jumpin like you should girl
It's got you bouncin "Off The Wall"
It's got you drunk enough to fall
(Too bad), oh oh, Hollywood, just makin it clearer
And tell me ya like, don't you, don't you like it?

[Chorus - Michael Jackson]
Monster (she wanna be a star), he's a monster (say you wanna go far)
He's an animal (why do you keep stalkin me?)
Monster (what ya do to me?), he's a monster (why did you take it? Why did you fake it?)
He's an animal (yeah, why are you hauntin me?)

Monster (why are you stalkin me?), he's a monster (why are you hauntin me?)
He's an animal (why did you do it? Why did you? Why are you stalkin me?)

Monster (why are you hauntin me?), he's a monster (why are you hauntin me?)
He's an animal (Why did you? Why did you? Ooh)

[Outro - Michael Jackson] - 2X
He's draggin you down like a monster
He's keepin you down like a monster</pre>
