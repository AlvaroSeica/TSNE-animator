A-heh-heh-yeah-ha-ha, heh, California
City of Angels, it's gon' be trouble
Uhh, right
I've been preachin this all my life, right bro?
Lock your windows, rrrrraahhhhh

[singers] + (rapper)
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Ooooooooh, California (watch out, here we go)
Ooooooooh, California (city of dreams)
Comin on home, comin on home, comin on home - I'm comin on home
To California (aight check this out)

[rapper]
The City of Angels, California, one hell of illusion
Models, sun, strippers, porn stars and movies
Compton, Beverly Hills, Hollywood Hills
Sunset Boulevard, girls walkin the strip
Stars and screams, ghetto kids starve to eat
Stay cool as police abuse the law on the streets
Silicone, South Central killer zone
Plastic surgery, piercing from ass to nose
Slang my wood, all the way to Inglewood
Nuttin pretty for sure in the century city
Spreadin this to Manhattan Beach, steroid freaks
Where the homeless weak, afraid to eat
I ain't talkin 'bout the sunshine
All I talk about is poverty and high crime
No doubt, Ike Dirty 'bout to bust yo' bubble
California watch out, cause it's gon' be trouble

[singers]
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Ooooooooh, California
Ooooooooh, California
Comin on home, comin on home, comin on home
To California

[rapper]
Uh, it's gon' be trouble, yup, in California
What?  Uhh
What's up, we gon' keep runnin with it?
Here we go
L.A., the City of Angels
California, uhh, uhh
Yo

[singers] + (rapper)
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Ooooooooh, California (c'mon man)
Ooooooooh, California
