[Vulgar]
Blazing out army brigades
MC with rage cause rampage to this whole rap game
Cause pain to the brain frame, raps is insane
Blowing the doors of your fratetrain, making it rain on a dry day
Telling you its die day for MCs is my way
Limbs get divided like a pizza in a pie place
Enter my horror and we drop the maroon drapes
Pro's Laboratory and now you're stuck in a dark fate
Listen to Vulgar, you better know that the style slays
Skitzo face, switch my style up, dead this place, watch organs pile up
Your tapes suck with mild touch, you couldn't brain bust if you had a gat to clutch
My voice pumps a double thrust punch to your gut
Fuck with my click, your shit out of luck
It's the dead touch

[Holocaust]
You don't wanna see Alcatraz bunker G
A vampire hunter D, thunder chief from under junkyard heap
See he will battle fools and saddle bruise, tattle flews mechanical
Then axe dismantle crews from here to Malibu
You don't wanna see Alcatraz bunker G
A vampire hunter D, thunder chief from under junkyard heap
See he will battle fools and saddle bruise, tattle flews mechanical
Then axe dismantle crews from here to Malibu
Catch a kid, hit trail of Kid Calico
Little foxes and little cobras don't even know us, leaves of ice stasis zebra
Even the wolves travel in a pack, ravel in a shack, stab you in the back
Gat attack a whole mob at the Dairy, for them two
And I laugh a cold fog at the very thought of you
Gat attack a whole mob at the Dairy, for them too
And I laugh a cold fog at the very thought of you
I will spook when spoken too, American Graffiti
COMBUSTION, cherish this Tahiti discussion

[Pro the Leader]
Yo, as unpleasant as it seems happiness eludes me
As unpleasant as it seems happiness eludes me
Well never get to be stress free
Loneliness for you means loneliness for me
All human beings get disposed quick
Now you've been exposed to this hideous experience
Life's lessons taught me don't trust anyone
Don't believe every thing you hear, I don't believe anything you say
(Melodic mysteries) my minds nuts over the beat
This is way beyond payment raps, sound ??? It's all me
But what I feel eternally couldn't be described in words
Scattered emotions release vengeance, rearranged thoughts,
Reoccurring visions, render you a decrepit corpse
One thing that eludes me is happiness
I'm reluctant to say that sadness is all that's left as unpleasant as it seems
Pick your self up, move on, don't be held back
I've come to the realization that everything is a trap
Every man makes his own choices, stand up voice your opinion
All though I said fuck your bias opinions
Don't get it confused, those are not contradictions
Don't base all things on perception, use different perspectives
It's always something new every day; you learn something new every day
I'm highly complex
It's only an increment of specific styles I use to get you thinking
Get out of that dream state; realize I'm here to help you
And in order for me to do so, you'll have The Pro cleanse your soul
I just wanna be alone by my self before I go
I just wanna be alone by my self before I go
I just wanna be alone by my self before I go
You can choose to ignore the voices or let them lead you in the right direction
Crossing life's intersections
My objective is to do the right thing
MY OBJECTIVE IS TO DO THE RIGHT THING</pre>
