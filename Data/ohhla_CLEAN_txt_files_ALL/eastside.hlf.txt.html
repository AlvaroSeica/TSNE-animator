[Chill verse]
a little sumthin for the clubs, crips, rucks for your ride
G'z and locs from the east and the westside
dedicated to the gang related
fuckin fools down makin the other side runnin high
throw your straps in the sky one time
buck buck, buck, we don't give a fuck
lay yo ass in the gutter or shit
keep the bust to my niggaz from the east and the west click

[Lil' 1/2 Dead singin and (talkin)]

so put your shit in the deck or just replace and let the take ride
(we gon put it in and let it ride baby)
cuz me and my homie Chill are droppin gangsta shit
(we droppin enough of that gangsta shit)
the type o' shit that none of you bustaz can fuck with
(that's right, where none of you bustaz can fuck with)
so step the fuck back before you smacked all in ya face
(before you get smacked up)
cuz when it comes to puttin it down Half Dead runs the whole place
(yeah)

[Chill chorus]
we chillin on the eastside, smokin weed on the westside
gettin drunk on the eastside, fuckin bitches on the westside
gettin jacked on the eastside, one times on the westside
O.G.'z on the eastside, O.G.'z on the westside
one two, one two

[Chill verse]
now that shit ain't got thick
so I'm throwin up the westside on the one hype click
slumped up in an 8-5 cuthey

[Chill chorus]

big booty on the eastside, big ass buttery on the westside

[Lil' 1/2 Dead verse]
