[ Skee-Lo ]
we fall and we bounce back I bet you an ounce that
my lyrics make sense and the base line's phat
this life that I'm livin' is so sweet that
I'm constantly chased by millions of hoodrats
in the same room I see them all at one time
yellin' Drew better get you a freak I got mine
and I know she probably be wit me in no time
cause it's gold on my watch and money on my mind
plus I'm rollin' a Lex that's on 20's
serious about my sound so my amps be
fillin' up most of the space that be empty
don't want to take yo chick so don't tempt me
can't get it out my head
this thought I had when I got out of bed
as I looked at the mirror at myself and said
got to call Big Chris, Drewskee and Tez
see what's crackin' tonight

[ Kozii (chorus 2x) ]
do it tonight
all night
let's get it started right

[ Drewskee ]
sittin' in the casino surrounded by women
up twenty thousand tryin' to cash in my winnings
Hennessey on the rocks got my head spinnin'
baby see me count my money then she started grinnin'
can I go wit you she said me and my friend
and I'm lookin' for Skee-Lo so we can tag team him
call him on the celly phone, what's goin' on
tonight's the night like Betty Wright
let's get it on
I got two ladies say they really like your music
they say they not groupies but still they want to do me
you tell them that we ain't spendin' a dime
I ain't got to tell them nothing they still stuck in '99
plus I'm not wastin' your time
what these freaks look like
well, mines is tight but yours is fine
I'ma tell you one more time
you need to hit me back on the line
let me know what's up for tonight

[ Kozii (chorus) ]
do it tonight
all night
let's get it started right

[ Skee-Lo ]
say Drew these brothers ain't done nothing new
and for everything they did we done done that too
let them go ahead and stare skeeter don't care
I crush the player hater out of anybody in there
even padlocks ain't safe from mattlock
you shouldn't have got me started I told you I can't stop
makin' your heart drop, makin' you kids watch
I'll make you wanna party wit everyone on your block
thinkin' you top notch you trippin' like hop schotch
my lyrics is blue prints two chicks on Bay Watch
for exposure, we get wet and smoke doja
everybody know about Skee I gots flow I
don't mess wit none of these women that's mintelosha
everybody tryin' to get a sip of my Momosa

[ Kozii (chorus) ]
do it tonight
all night
let's get it started right</pre>
