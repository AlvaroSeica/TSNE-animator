[Verse 1]
Hey
I eat the sticker off the apple
The peal off the banana
I'm the kicker and the tackle
The DJ and the rapper
I'm the whipper and the snapper
The student and the teacher
I'm the Hannah, the Montana
I'm The Judas, I'm the Jesus
I'm the foolish and the genius
The truest and the fakest
I'm the coolest dufus usin Luden's, nudest and the naked
I'm a do it, I'm a make it
I'm a brew it, I'm a bake it
I'm amusing, I'm amazing

I influence influenza
The healthy and afflicted
I am melting and I'm liquid
I'm belching at a picnic
Winning belts at the Olympics
I am simply complex
I am thickly concentrated symbiotic objects
"Him be honest? Nonsense
He used to be a liar
With truancy and lunacy
A nuisance, he retired?"
I have grown condoning flows
And no, it's not conjecture
I'll float your boat through moats and oceans
Now you get the picture

[Chorus]
I'm a little (little?) little bit of everything
Everything
Little (little?) little bit of everything
Everything
Little (little?) little bit of everything
Everything
Everything? Everything. Everything

[Verse 2]
I'm the house and I'm the player
The winner and the loser
I'm the mouse and I'm the mayor
The dinner and the cougar
I'm the sinner and the savior
The thinner and the layered
Beginner and a veteran
I'm the Excedrin taken by David Letterman
Letters flippin' like Vannah White
Abraham thinkin'
Blinkin' my eyes
Mai tais I'm drinkin'
I'm shrinkin' and I'm growin'
I'm floatin' and I'm sinkin'
Dunkin Donuts David Dinkins
He just said, "Dunkin Donuts David Dinkins. What?"

I go to war to keep it civil
Having accidents on purpose
I'm enormous and I'm chiseled
Speak in accents and I'm wordless
I'm a thermos laced with Percocet
A tourniquet with holes
Peter Griffin with a thermostat
I am Moses with 2 tablets and a burning bush
Turning mush into perfectness
Serpents swerving learning that scratching on your epidermis
Leaves you yearning for another itch
I'm all-day coverage
I'm obvious and subtle
I'm trouble
I'm women's suffrage

[Chorus]
I'm a little (little?) little bit of everything
Everything
Little (little?) little bit of everything
Everything
Little (little?) little bit of everything
Everything.
Everything? Everything. Everything.

[Bridge]
Buggin' out
I could feed you poison
I could be the potion
I could leave you voiceless
I can explosions, commotion, corrosion, emotion

[Verse 3]
Ok, I own a business and I rap
I'm livin givin craps not about fiction only facts
I'm a teacher from Manhattan who could out spit a llama
I'm an executive who goes to work in his pajamas

I am Wesley and I'm Woodie
The friendly and the pushy
I'm the testes and the tushy
I'm refreshing and disgusting
I am Felix and I'm Oscar
The realest and imposter
Double helix and a rhombus
I'm a vegan eatin rhubarb
(But wouldn't a vegan eat rhubarb?)
Yeah I know those aren't opposites
I am also quite synonymous
I'm Jesse like Catsopolis
I could be your uncle
I'm the forest and the jungle
I'm amorphous
I am humble
I am formless and enormous
I'm the thunder and the storm
It's not a wonder I'm the morn
I'm the dawn and I'm the mourner
I'm the fawn and I'm the former
I'm the brawn and I'm the corner
I'm the lawn and I'm the mower</pre>
