DJ Butter
Dirty Harry, be killin niggas
Bugz

[Proof]
Niggas bite what they can't be
The rich throw what they can't eat
Niggas you ain't sweet
Coughin and gaggin
Often I'm braggin
Got a big dick to stop my pants from saggin
Waggin your tail like a fag in the jail
Keep real dogs fuckin like weed bags in the mail
Empty you vein like a sword to flesh
You niggas rap about nothing like Lord Finesse
This is Bugz

[Bugz]
Let me know
You niggas was shoot or start a scrap
You think they wanna shoot
I'll put a bullet through they starter cap
This a about every niggas that I beat up
Stomped unconscience
Smacked with the heater
Fuck you, Bugz don't give a fuck about your feelings
I blow your shit out like I gun hustle Simmons
So hide your knot when you walkin up my block
Niggas smack you with the glock
And take the money out your sock

Chorus: Bugz (repeat 2x)
Know to act a fool
And wild out when we buzzin
Always rumblin
Rowdy niggas dirty dozen
Cold blooded but album hotter then a oven
You want beef, what nigga start sumtin

[Proof]
Its Proof the total package
You total wackiness
The fact is
You need a life time of practice
I'm active bounce in the coupe
To the mountain of tooth
Found the fountain of youth
My daughter is countin on Proof
Get head for survival, blaze over
Before Armageddon snatched the prove out the Bible
Kill a rival with the impact of a rifle
And cleaned the blood out
Before ??? crypt and my disciple

[Proof talking]
Man let me tell what type a nigga I am
I'm the type of motherfucker that write rhymes that kill niggas
I'm the type of nigga that niggas can't fuck with
You know what I'm sayin, that what type of nigga I am
That's the type I am

[Bugz]
You the type write away gone write a million rhymes a day
Come back around the way and sound the same old entire way
Bugz will grab a brew and drink a proof from Mary J
And bust a freestyle that sounds better then your tape
You style is bitchy, I have a harder time with Missy
Your whole set up sucks like Monica Lewinsky
I can cop a seed and read a dictionary first
And kill you with a rap full of words I just learned

Chorus: Bugz (repeat 2x)

[Bizarre talking]
Start something boy, start something with Robert Beck
What, start something with Dirty Harry
Bizarre, Da Brigade, Kon Artsit, we don't give a fuck nigga
