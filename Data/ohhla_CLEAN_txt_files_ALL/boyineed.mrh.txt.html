Ooh Just Blaze, ha
Ooh-hoo yeah
Ooh, umm
(Boy-boy-boy-boy)

[Mariah Carey]
I can't help it
When I'm not around you (Boy)
Cause all I ever seem to do is drift away
In dreams about you
Cause when I'm without you (Boy)
It always seems like (Boy-boy-boy-boy)
Part of me is missing baby
Sometimes I don't call
Like I don't care at all
But secretly, you're the only thing
That lifts me up and makes me smile
When I'm unhappy
All you gotta do is call
And suddenly things don't really (Boy-boy-boy-boy)
Seem so bad at all

[Chorus]
(Boy) I need you
(Boy) Adore you (Boy)
Gotta have you (Oh boy)
I wanna feel your touch
This ain't no little crush
So come and get my love
Baby anything you want
Feeling you (Boy)
Fiending for you (Boy)
Just waiting on you (Boy)
When I see you (Oh boy)
I'm gonna wrap you up
Inside my love
And never let you go boy
Never let you go boy (Boy-boy-boy-boy)

[Mariah Carey]
My heart races when
My Motorola beeps or my cell rings
I just make a wish and if it's you
My whole day changes
Cause when I know
You're thinking of me (Boy)
Heaven knows (Boy-boy-boy-boy)
Suddenly it's not so dismal baby
Sometimes I don't call
Like I don't care at all
But secretly, you're the only thing
That lifts me up
And makes me smile
When I'm unhappy
All you gotta do is call
And suddenly things don't really
Seem so bad at all

[Chorus]
(Boy) I need you
(Boy) Adore you (Boy)
Gotta have you (Oh boy)
I wanna feel your touch
This ain't no little crush
So come and get my love
Baby anything you want
Feeling you (Boy) {Killa}
Fiending for you (Boy) {Mariah}
Just waiting on you (Boy) {Yeah}
When I see you (Oh boy) {Got you}
I'm gonna wrap you up
Inside my love {Where we at}
And never let you go boy
Never let you go boy (Boy-boy-boy-boy)

[Cam'Ron {Mariah}]
Uh, mami feelin' my gangsta cause usually I stay on the block
But the girl went world jet straight to the yacht
Eighth and I sought jewelry, chrome, and stones
Wows and jows, loud coes and jones
Go to Capri and see my mami Mariah
Chanel glasses, hottie and fire
Mami's a rider
She wants the (Boy)
So I give her the (Boy)
Now she screamin' out (Boy-boy-boy-boy)
She want the hundred carat (Boy)
The Harlem World (Boy)
My arm is savage, better guard ya girl (Boy)
So ha-uh-huh call me
And we'll start to cake up
Mark Jacob, you're a heartbreaker
Good (Boy) I'm a mobster and pimp
Eight ki's, two hammers, lobster and shrimp
Look at my limp, mami we could be a couple still (Boy-boy-boy-boy)
Say ma look, help me sell a couple mill (Boy)
Now sing (Boy)

[Mariah {Cam'Ron}]
I...{What?} (Boy)
Need...{Who?} (Boy)
You...{Uh huh, uh huh} (Oh Boy)
I wanna feel your touch...{Why wouldn't you}
So come and get my love {Show me where it's at} (Boy)
{Now sing}
I... {What?} (Boy)
Need... {Who?} (Boy)
You... {Uh huh, uh huh} (Boy)
I'm gonna wrap you up {Wrap me up} (Boy-boy-boy-boy)
And never let you go boy
Never let you go boy {Never let me go, girl}

[Chorus repeated to fade]
(Boy) I need you {Killa}
(Boy) Adore you (Boy) {Mariah}
Gotta have you (Oh boy) {Diplomats}
I wanna feel your touch
This ain't no little crush
So come and get my love
Baby anything you want
Feeling you (Boy)
Fiending for you (Boy)
Just waiting on you (Boy)
When I see you (Oh boy)
I'm gonna wrap you up
Inside my love
And never let you go boy
Never let you go boy
