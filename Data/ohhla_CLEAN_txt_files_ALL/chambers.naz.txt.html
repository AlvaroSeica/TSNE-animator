[Sample]
What would life be, Ohh without your sweet love

[Bronze Nazareth]
Yo, yo, these amped up niggas throw they words like curves
Secret nights we stole mics, Treasure maps and furs
Fierce pen, Felony on my table, I clean my dishes and
Niggas in those projects peddle drugs to the fishermen
Morphine, Wet snort, X, Cialis
While I walked straight lines it seemed I never had a balance
We bought to rob all shit, Could've brought home thirteen
Chill man, A pusher make you think when you come clean
Illuminate skeletons, Burglerize your residence
I'm at Eastern and Burton cooking up the wrong substances
Niggas in the park see my fingers trim their cartilage
I'll give you twenty for a brick or banana clip cartridges
That's not how I live but bricks bags around me
In the bathroom bagging up mix they never found me
An old settler, Shop lifted meals to grow better
Walked through that crack house that smell made me black out
Drunk my first bottle could've ate the glass
I was so gone it seemed like the sky was falling fast
I grind like the plant though, Don't even sweat it man
I'm in the mist of a war verses my left hand

[Sample]

[Interlude: Bronze Nazareth]
word up them niggas was starting to fly
I'm like yo nigga, Hey son, Yo
Pass me that shit kid
Hey, I don't even smoke right now nigga
Hey back up nigga, What the fuck is wrong with you

[Bronze Nazareth]
Sort of like black box like funerals only for black socks
Matchbox cars I push it like it was our Pop
Ultra hot uterus clanging on the pole
Dug deep like how my lines dangle in your soul
Selling hope instead of my iris sitting by the scope
In a fatigued down war within the city ring ropes
Hungry days, Ramen noodles bought by the cave
I'm richer, My mental picture's worth a thousand free slaves
Back to famine P.M., Seen dancing with three gems
Jewels into men easier to blaze in the skin
But he aint listening, Tattooed arms with smoke blasting
Rose through darkness like a young lethal Jackson
Mega size, Plugging his heart full of cholesterol
Shots in his head rest spun around like reciprocal
Named his blade, Crusade disintegrate
Smoke like he had scarlet fever, Street renegade
Declare Michigan fertile for crops and dead flowers
Where swords stay it's poisonous, Spoke for burning towers
Made me think though money came like water from a sink though
Needed that cash but the camera saw me blink slow
slow, Word up, And now it's a wrap</pre>
