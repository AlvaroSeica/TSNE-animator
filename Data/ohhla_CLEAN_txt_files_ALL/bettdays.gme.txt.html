Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Andre Merritt]
Been holding this pain inside for so long
though the rain never goes away
they say I should leave these streets behind me
but its so hard to escape
oh lord please send me an angel
to lead me out of this place
send me a away
far away
to better days

[The Game]
the first thing I wanna do is say wat up to TI
king of the south, now everybody see why
im just driving and thinking why I survived here
and I aint seen dre and eminem in 5 years
that sound shady right
i live a crazy life
so many black thoughts I had to paint the mercedes white
I can tell you about the rims but I aint here for that
going out like big and pac I fear for that
take this lambo and put 6 holes in it
shatter the glass and leave my body exposed in it
lift the doors up and let all my demons out
and I can see my brother now cos thats what i been dreaming bout
i aint thinking bout bitches or pulling beemers out
im thinking bout my son safety everytime they leave the house
i know how to make it out the hood i seen the route
and heres the proof me venus and serena out

[Chorus - Andre Merritt]
Been holding this pain inside for so long
though the rain never goes away
they say I should leave these streets behind me
but its so hard to escape
oh lord please send me an angel
to lead me out of this place
send me a away
far away
to better days

[The Game]
im sitting on these stairs at this church
bout to start a verse
and somewhere in the world somebody about to start a hoarse
tell me who inside it, whos son is that
and how he get there, now tell me who gun is that
i aint saying confess definietly aint saying snitch
but if you kiled the n-gga help his momma dig his ditch
im from the hood where n-gga gotta keep their gun cocked
kids wear dre beats to stop the sound of gun shots
but at least they got the dre beats cos kids in africa aint even got shoes on they feet
and i seen it on my own eyes at the same time I picking flys off my own eyes
can you feel that, if you can hear them buzzing
you can feel the pain of Mike Tyson and his baby mother
they lost there baby daughter and she was only 3
she never got a chance to blossom on the family tree

[Chorus - Andre Merritt]
Been holding this pain inside for so long
though the rain never goes away
they say I should leave these streets behind me
but its so hard to escape
oh lord please send me an angel
to lead me out of this place
send me a away
far away
to better days

[The Game]
We got a new president and I love that he black
but Imma ask him like bush, where the soldiers at?
now move the camera to new orleans where the soldiers at
the water dried up well n-gga do you know they clap
we all juveniles we all been through some trials
and some tribulations, Im in this booth pacing
what do I say next, should I talk about some cars
or the next chapter of my life and show you all my scars
or my bullet wounds and my stab wounds
cant show you I covered them up with tattoos
i cant do nothing but spit the truth
on probation smoking drink patron before I hit the booth
you making songs for the clubs while n-ggas drinking
i make em for the ride home when n-ggas stinking
one minute you here, next minute sh-t is tragic
and its a Jim Johnsin track now fill this stack

[Chorus - Andre Merritt]
Been holding this pain inside for so long
though the rain never goes away
they say I should leave these streets behind me
but its so hard to escape
oh lord please send me an angel
to lead me out of this place
send me a away
far away
to better days</pre>
