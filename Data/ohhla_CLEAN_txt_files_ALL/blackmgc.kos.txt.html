Yo
La da da da da
And we come again

La da da da da
Never fake the funk, nope
da da da da

Gotham city in the house
da da
Some people say I drink too much
But I don't give a..
They all sitting ducks
The world we livin' now, Fashion TV
going to the mall way too easy
Paid by numbers
no sense of magic no sense of wonder

But I'm just a man
Who spent 100,000 grand
on a bottle on wine

I'm just a man
Who knows the plan, everytime

But I'm just a man
Who spent 100,000 grand
on a bottle on wine

I'm just a man
Who knows the other plan, to get rid of time

Mind of matter
You subtract north and you'll get life

da da da

Ok one more time?</pre>
