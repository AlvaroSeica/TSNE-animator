[Beyonce]
Boyyyyyyy

[Chorus One]
Ohhh~! Killing me softly
And I'm still falling
Still the one I need
I will always be with you
Ohhh and you got me all gone
Don't ever let me go
Say it real loud if you fly
If you leave me you oughta go blind

[Chorus Two]
My baby is a 10
We dressin to the 9
He pick me up at 8
Make me feel so lucky 7
He kiss me in his 6
We be makin love at 5
Still the one I do this 4
I'm trynna make us 3 from that 2
He's still the 1

[Beyonce]
There's ups and downs in this love
Got a lot to learn and it's love
Through the good and the bad, still got love
Dedicated to the one I love, heyyy
Still love the way he talk, still love the way I sang
Still love the way he rock them black diamonds in that chain
Still all up on each other, ain't a damn thing changed
My girls can't tell me nothin, I'm gone in the brain
I'm all up under him like it's cold, winter time
All up in the kitchen in my heels, dinner time
Do whatever that it takes he got a winner's mind
Give it all to him, meet him at the finish line
Me and my boo, and my boo boo riding
All up in that black, with his chick right beside him
Ladie, if you love your man show him you the flyest
Grind up on it girl, show him how you ride it
Me and my boo and my boo boo riding
All up in that black with his chick right beside him
Ladies if you love your man show him you the flyest
Grind up on it girl, show him how you ride it

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]

[Beyonce]
Yup I put it on him, it ain't nothin that I can't do
Yup I buy my own if he deserve it buy his shit too
All up in the store shorty, trickin if I want to
All up in the store shorty, fly as we want to
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Damn I think I love that boy, do anything for that boy
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Now I'll never be the same, it's you and me until the end
Me and my boo and my boo boo riding
All up in that black with his chick right beside him
Ladies if you love your man, show him you the flyest
Grind up on it girl, show him how you ride it
Me and my boo and my boo lip lockin
All up in the back because the chicks keep blockin
All that gossip in ten years stop it
London speed it up, Houston +Rocket+

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]</pre>
