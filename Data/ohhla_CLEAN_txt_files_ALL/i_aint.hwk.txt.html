Song:   I Ain't Playin'
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus: Tommy Whispers]
I ain't, playin', games, no more, four-four
Blowing, through ya, face, break, jaws, break, yours

[Tommy Whispers]
I'm hearing voices in my head
I'm hearing voices in my head
They telling me, you better be more careful of them streets
Cuz nine of ten niggas, is packing heat
And them niggas you think is pussy, ain't really sweet
I seen alotta shit in my life, I shouldn't have seen
A pisces, a clash of my own, a different seat
A zone, light up the bone of potency
Ladies love the sound of voice, say I'm a G
Light skin, sunshine sky, I got the bright skin
I got my own problem at home, I do not wife 'em
I pipe 'em, give 'em the goods and them I hyped them
Nike Timbs, all the rock homes, I white on white them
Jeez please, don't scuff up my trees
You better wipe them, I squeeze
I'm too damn thin for all that fighting
Brought light, out of the sight, before the night hit
Performing on a night shift, Tommy got a tight grip, grip

[Chorus: Tommy Whispers]
I ain't, playin', games, no more, four-four
Blowing, through ya, face, break, jaws, break, yours
Fuck, police, ignore, all laws, all laws
I ain't, playin', games, no more, four-four

[Tommy Whispers]
I'm a hell raiser, like my man, Hell Razah
Sun of Man, cutting up grams, to get that paper
For my hustlers, touring the land, with four flavors
Major playor, snatch at you hoes, for all you haters
The greatest lesson is never owe, so get ya weight up
Fresh shape-up, more better, that's razor
Sometimes I let it woof out, smoke pull the kush out
Hella lit, president standards, live in the Bush house
Mush mouth, I'm nasty with words, live at the cook out
Shishakabob, plot with my man, to get ya niggas robbed
Different cars, switch up ya V, I'm into bigger Dodge
Ram and bang, sent to the moon, like Ralph tantrum
Can't stand 'em, conceited, I'm too handsome
Ransom, over two mil, for ya grandson
Crack the safe, dollar bill ya'll, CREAM, pass the cake
Stapleton, my niggas is hungry, please pass the plate

[Chorus]</pre>
