[Intro: Hell Razah]
Yeah, Heaven Razah, wings up
All my T.H.U.G. Angelz riding
You know how the halo go
Bob Marley like this one, yo

[Hell Razah]
I stay surrounded with a Godly council, ammount to
A hundred and forty four thousand children to count to
We turn our projects to pentagons, it's war around you
We come from, black jewels to dirty scoundrels of the state
I know the most high supply, every nature cause
To the actual, physical, the spiritual loss
When he knock us up, for you the one to open the doors
I seen my people steady falling, like it ain't no floors
Bottomless pits, for hell convicts
A conscience, black awareness of the kings and prophets of the lord
Clean your soul from the wickedness before you, boy
Eternal life is my only reward

[Chorus: Hell Razah]
Blessed be the meek in us...
Blessed be the meek in us...
Blessed be the meek in us...
Blessed be the meek in us...

[Junior Reid]
Stallion, boy
Give me what my heart desire
Getting smoke from a burning fire
Getting smoke from a burning fire
Give me what my heart desire
Give me what my heart desire
Getting smoke from a burning fire
Getting smoke from a burning fire
Give me what my heart desire
Getting smoke from a burning fire
Getting smoke from a burning fire</pre>
