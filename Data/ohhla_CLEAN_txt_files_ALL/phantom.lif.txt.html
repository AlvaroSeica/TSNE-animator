[Mr. Lif]
Check it out
I been waitin, playin, for a long time
X amount of thoughts carried out in my mind
I turn on the TV and see crime
Script written diligently, then aired on time
Pushed the power button, now to devour somethin
Opened up my fridge and found nothin
Dipped to my room with an aura of gloom
Wishin I could write another tune
But my hands are paralyzed, plus my eyes
Wanna shed tears, but it's not possible, there's
the burden of things I couldn't bear
Feelings weren't dealt with properly, remorse follows me
With his good friend, the threat of poverty
Here's where I am, versus where I think I oughta be
There's a certain chance I'm a victim of circumstance
I take a look at myself and at first glance
I see who I recently thought to be me
Based on identities public and private
Behold the radio pirate, your nigga
A felon, chillin with a gun to your melon
A pimp with his pockets swellin, a jester
A slave with wounds that fester
The wannabe pre-med 3-D dread
An academic reject, hopin to detect
why we wreck what God gave, human laws are laid
We go to war, come back and come up with more
I'm kind, friendly; your worst enemy
Charming, crass, and potentially
dangerous, have you ever heard of such?
I'm invisible and impossible to touch

[Chorus 3X: EL-P]
This is not my beautiful melting identity
Corrupts, and I can't manipulate
For the same blind description of one amongst many
is the macro; made from the pain of the fragile

[Mr. Lif]
I still say fresh dope and things of that sort
I don't shoot up, smoke crack, or take shorts
Your thoughts are always welcome, I seldom
Won't enter another's perspective, corrective lenses
arrre somethin that I wear
So I can see the globe real clear
Look there's famine over there, plus your family's in fear
of disease and the stress that lingers in the air
These are the words of a man in purgatory
Words of a simpleton living in oblivion
Is this the model for life you were envisioning
free as can be in a world of imprisonment?
I dare you to check new territory
American dream? Time for another story
One where I don't choke to keep afloat
I'm sick of livin' on false visions of hope
with a knife to my own throat
Stick of dynamite inside my overcoat, because I know the ropes
Reality in this world is bought and sold
A very limited scope of life is shown
And I'm just one in the mold, fully controlled
Left to erode in my humble abode
You won't hear me because I got no loot
You don't hear me because you won't compute
I'm docile, psycho, have you heard of such?
I'm invisible and impossible to touch

Single mother, who are you? (I phantom)
Office worker, who are you? (I phantom)
Caught up in the system, who are you? (I phantom)
Tryin' to earn a living, who are you? (I phantom)
Depressed and uninspired, who are you? (I phantom)
Hard-workin', broke and tired, who are you? (I phantom)
Seekin' education, who are you? (I phantom)
Can't get ahead no matter what you do? (I phantom)</pre>
