[Everlast]
Please, please, please don't, leave me now girl
After all I've done for you
On my knees here, let's work it out woman
After all that we've been through; I told you that

[Chorus]
Everyone cheats, everyone lies
Everyone suffers and everyone cries
Old people laugh, young people try
Lovers they know when they look in your eyes
Everyone cheats, everyone lies
Everyone hustles and everyone strives
Bad people win, and good people die
Lovers they know when they look in your eyes

[Everlast]
Hush your mouth girl, and settle down woman
Cause you don't make no sense
Make up your mind girl, and come around now
Come down from off that fence; don't you know

[Chorus]

[Everlast]
Watch your temper girl, and calm your nerves down
Better watch how you react
Put your hands down, and back up off me woman
Cause you might get touched back~! I told you that

[Chorus] - repeat 2X with instrumental in between

[Outro]
When they look in your eyes {*2X*}
Lovers they know when they look in your eyes</pre>
