[Knickolist Knowledge] (Cno Evil) {Li-Mouse}
Aiyo, my team's winning, going hard
From the first to the ninth inning
(Then to the finish, like we cross the line and win it
Gone in sixty seconds like a minute)
Diminish negativity, it was done once
It can't be done again, potential to infinity
{You can't get rid of me, fuck it, these jeans look big on me}
Same artillery, you can't fuck with the vocabulary
(Technically, my speech is like John F. Kennedy
The President, I'm irrelevant) {I'm hesitant, spitting with no
speech impediment}
Several prints let out mentally, ready to made instantly
Similar to how I play alphabetically (Similar to how I play verbally
Eternally natural like an herbal leaf)
{Curing your mind, curing diseases, stopping the sneezes, lyrical breezes}
With the verbal street thesis (break your brain down into little Reese's Pieces)
{And we be folding ya'll like pants and creases} My flow is crafted
Coming through these speakers digitally remastered {you bastards}
(Fantastic, not four, but three MC's, Mouse, Knowledge, Cno E)
Catch me at Knick 360, yeah, you heard of me {And Li, fucking with this MC}
(Who's next, you or me? I don't know, here I flow) So here it go, yo
Time to let you know, from making freestyle tapes to karaoke machines
But living out bigger dreams, and getting cream with my team
(Now it seems its a dream, so I'm eating cuisine)
Shrimp, lobsters, muscles, fresh greens and beans
{Alfredo, noodles, vegetables that steam}
(Stop bitching, go in the kitchen and clean)
{Bars like soap, I'm praised like the Pope}
(When I mix this joint down, it sounds dope)
Thought you had me against the ropes, shit was over? Nope
{I'm the silent killer in the trees with the scope
You go down like snowboarders down the slope}
(And you have no hope when the swords against your throat)</pre>
