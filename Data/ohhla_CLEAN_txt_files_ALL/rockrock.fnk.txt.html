Right about now, in this place to be
Most definately, the Bomfunk MC's dropping the bomb

Whole lot of soul as he cuts it up
Rock, rock and roll as he cuts it up
Cutmaster king with hardcore cuts
Making it rough, rock, rocking the spot
Cool evidently as he cuts it up
Break, breaking the funk as he cuts it up
Wounded heart with the B-Boys drop
Dropping the bomb, rock, rocking the spot
Watch behind move as he cuts it up
Delivering the groove as he cuts it up
Transforming the shit to the beat that rocks
Bad meaning, bad meaning, don't stop
You know you're itchy when he cuts it up
Place get wet as he cuts it up
Pure madness on wheels, throw em up, throw em up
Go Gismo, go, let me see what you're made of

Hear me out now cause the mic I will rock
You can't say I'm not cause the mic I'll rock
Boom boom, you feel lick a shot then you can lick a shot
This a DJ about to mash it up
Boom boom, you feel lick a shot then you can lick a shot
Boom boom, you feel lick a shot then you can lick a shot
Boom boom, you feel lick a shot then you can lick a shot
This a DJ about to mash it up

Fuck me, rocking the spot, what
Fuck me, take you to the top, what
Fuck me, throw em up, what, what
Doing the do cause the mic I'll rock, what

Fuck me, rocking the spot, what
Fuck me, take you to the top, what
Fuck me, throw em up, what, what
Doing the do cause the mic I'll rock, what

Hear me out now cause the mic I will rock
You can't say I'm not cause the mic I'll rock
Boom boom, you feel lick a shot then you feel lick a shot
This a DJ about to mash it up

Blowing the roof off cause the mic I'll rock
Got a rocket in my pocket cause the mic I'll rock
In the way to stars for the future shock
B-O-W rock, rocking the spot

Watch behind move as he cuts it up
Delivering the groove as he cuts it up
Transforming the shit to the beat that rocks
Bad meaning, bad meaning, don't stop
You know you're itchy when he cuts it up
Place go wet as he cuts it up
Pure madness on wheels, throw em up, throw em up
Go Gismo, go, let me see what you're made of

Hear me out now cause the mic I will rock
You can't say I'm not cause the mic I'll rock
Boom boom, you feel lick a shot then you feel lick a shot
This a DJ about to mash it up
Boom boom, you feel lick a shot then you can lick a shot
Boom boom, you feel lick a shot then you can lick a shot
Boom boom, you feel lick a shot then you can lick a shot
This a DJ about to mash it up

Fuck me, rocking the spot, what
Fuck me, take you to the top, what
Fuck me, throw em up, what, what
Doing the do cause the mic I'll rock, what

Fuck me, rocking the spot, what
Fuck me, take you to the top, what
Fuck me, throw em up, what, what
Doing the do cause the mic I'll rock, what</pre>
