Extracurricular, parallel to none
I am perpendicular
Hit 'em with the oh now that's just ridiculous
We could've kid up all these particulars
That could have been the homicide vehicular
You wasn't in to no state to speed off
You was buggin out, ya you was p'd off
We was just chilling up at the ski loft
Thinkin we was on, you telling me we off
Your whole vibe changed when you got that call
Best of affect they call a snow ball
Next thing you know I was running down the hall
Saying, "Please come back, I have giving my all."
I have given my all
Funny how you could always make me feel small
I had given my all

Catch me, catch me, I think I'm gonna fall
My mind is made up, I'm waiting for you
I'm waiting on you, waiting, boy
My mind is set, I'm waiting on you
I'm waiting for you, waiting boy
Could you catch me, could you catch me
Could you catch me?
I am waiting on you to catch me

You want it, oh, so bad to prove points
But your game always makes me lose points
And your game always makes me concur
That maybe I should have never taken you from her
But with all of the after mentions
I am still trapped in your dimension
So I will be on the mountain waiting
'cause I am in need of more attention
Could've called back just to say some
I'm a fall back in the bass drum
Please come to destination
I'm not doing well, exclamation!
You succeeded at your attempts to make me
Need you desperately to vindicate me
It's funny how you could always make me feel small
I have given my all

Catch me, catch me, I think I'm gonna fall
My mind is made up, I'm waiting for you
I'm waiting on you, waiting, boy
My mind is set, I'm waiting on you
I'm waiting for you, waiting, boy
Could you catch me, could you catch me
Could you catch me?
I am waiting on you to catch me

Oh, oh, OK, oh, oh, OK, oh, oh, OK
It's whatever you say
Eh, eh
It's whatever you say
Eh, eh

My mind is made up, I'm waiting for you
I'm waiting on you, waiting, boy
My mind is set, I'm waiting on you
I'm waiting for you, waiting, boy
Could you catch me, could you catch me
Could you catch me?
I am waiting on you to catch me</pre>
