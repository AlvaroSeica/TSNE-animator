YAY AREA!!!!
From the front to the back from the left to the right side, we worldwide
From the east to the westside get it girl that's right, let's ride
(I beat the pussy up)

[Verse One: 50 Cent]
She ain't got to tell me she want it she know I know that she with it
She moan and groan when I get it she told me lick it I did it
Sexy thang! Enough to make a nigga go crazy mayne do crazy thangs
We get the poppin and touchin we get the lickin and stickin
Now now you know what we doin when your around and we missin
We go to perfect positions we get it poppin now listen
Too much pleasure to measure she got the power to beat it
D make her wanna give it to me in a major way 
Jackpot jumpshot a nigga fade away
I mean way away, I be on that elite shit

Then we smoke a blunt and kick it like kung fu

[Verse Three: T.I.]
Hey! Beat that pussy up jab, jab, right hook
Send her home to her man let her watch that notebook
Shawty wanna hang on that coat hook (HAAAAAA!!!!)
Split that thang down the middle let her roll up
Sho' nuff gucci down to the shoelace
Hundred cash in the chain no fugaze
Hoe still sweat a nigga on a cool day
Them other sucker niggas faker than a school day
A rich nigga gotta pay that's what you say
I got bitches from the Bay to the U.K.
Thick with it pussy sweet like Kool Aid
Run it raw then I let her buss two straight
No suitcase on the PJ runway
Me plus two that's a G4 three way
Hey! I give her man a hard time
He got a soft six and I got a hard nine
HEY!

[Chorus: LoveRance]
I beat the pussy up! Up! Up! Up! Up! Up! Up!
I beat the pussy up! Up! Up! Up! Up! Up! Up!
I beat the pussy up! Up! Up! Up! Up! Up! Up!
I beat the pussy up! Up! Up! Up! Up! Up! Up!
I beat the pussy.....</pre>
