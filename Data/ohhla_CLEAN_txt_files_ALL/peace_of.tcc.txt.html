(Yesterday was bad, today was not much better
Tomorrow may not bring much better news
But since you can't erase it
Just force yourself to face it
And you can win, you haven't much to lose)

(If you don't have peace of mind, you can come to one conclusion
One day you'll find yourself in a mental institution
Dig me) --&gt; S.O.U.L.

(Can you hear me?)
(Yes mother)
(Okay then, I'll tell you)
(Be quick about it)
(I told you explain yourself to me, young man)

[ VERSE 1: MC/DJ Force ]
I'm different, I'm not your average MC
They put me down but in secret they envy
They can't accept the simple fact I'm not a thug
Blastin up an addict for some coke and some drugs
This isn't gangsterism, I prefer to be smart
I don't follow crowds, I act straight from the heart
Use my own mind, I'm not influenced by another man
I'm livin proof that a brother can
Learn from his own self, stick with one program
And have the gall to raise hell with a dope jam
To perplex the crowd, that's how I hit ya
Not a riffer nor a sniffer but the giver of a scripture
Demandin that the violence stop
Gain intelligence, stop ( ? ) your crew's block
Cause the way I live I'm doin fine
Don't try to criticize, boy, give me some peace of mind

(Gotta have peace of mind) --&gt; S.O.U.L.
(We got to have it) --&gt; James Brown
(Can you hear me?)
(Gotta have peace of mind)
(How long will it take?)
(What's the answer?)
(Gotta have peace of mind)
(Do you feel the force?)
(Yes)
(Gotta have peace of mind)
(Come on now) --&gt; Chuck D
(Okay)

(I told you explain yourself to me, young man)

[ VERSE 2: Jawn P ]
My peace of mind is influential
I got potential and I think that I was meant to
Be upon the microphone, speakin some knowledge, then
Remind you all we're from the same origin
We gotta get past the stage of stereotypin
Your color shouldn't matter if you keep the crowd hype and
That's my opinion, I guess that's my prerogative
Just let me finish and you'll see I got a lot to give
Cause I'm a superstar walkin with a hit song
(We're makin dollars, so you know they're on the tip, Jawn)
They're called groupies, they're after that one thing
They'll try to play ya for a big fat diamond ring
I'm sorry honey, I work hard for my dollars
You wanna try to get with it? Yo Force (Don't bother)
Cause in our world you'll just get left behind
Next time you gotta remember you have to have a peace of mind

(Gotta have peace of mind)
(We got to have it)
(Can you hear me?)
(Gotta have peace of mind)
(How long will it take?)
(What's the answer?)
(Gotta have peace of mind)
(Do you feel the force?)
(Yes)
(Gotta have peace of mind)
(Come on now)
(Okay)

(Listen to me, we ain't got too much time
You got to have some, you got to have) --&gt; S.O.U.L.

[ VERSE 3: MC/DJ Force ]
Now what's this, you're sayin hip-hop isn't music?
Then why do so many rap fans choose it?
They're impressed by the beat and the rhyme track
And if you suckers paid attention you would find that
There are many styles, simple and complicated
This one's simple, when I'm complex I'm top-rated
I choose to chill on this song to get across
A basic message - I hold it, then let it off
Many complain that you can't dance to a rap rhythm
I prove 'em wrong - I just smack, hit 'em
With a couple of beats to make their hands clap
And when I'm finished they'll admit that the jam's packed
And if you don't, who gives a hell about you, brother?
Too strong is the hip-hop culture
So if you don't like it, yo, well that's fine
Respect my feelings, boy, give me some peace of mind

(Gotta have peace of mind)
(Let the hate decrease and like increase the peace) --&gt; Big Daddy Kane
(Gotta have peace of mind)
(Stop the violence and kick the science) --&gt; D-Nice
(Gotta have peace of mind)
(How wonderful)
(That's pretty good)

Yo Top Choice, why don't you 'em where you're comin from, boyeee...

Go (Boston)
Go
Go Boston

[ VERSE 4: Jawn P ]
You said we wouldn't last, hah, what a statement
Laughin up a storm when you put our tape in
But now we made it and you still try to diss
Because you're stuck with the crews who can't produce any hits
My son, you'll learn a lesson when you listen to our music
Use it as an artform, and don't abuse it
We stand together to get the point across
That when we rhyme with a message, that doesn't make us soft
We're creative, just like a genius
Shock the crowd, in the past you have seen this
Hip-hop song with a message that's negative
Cool and smooth, this jam is like a sedative
I stand strong, never soft ( ? )
Step with the rep and I beat with a horse whip
I give you a chance to what you sought you can find
Next time you gotta remember you have a have a peace of mind

(Gotta have peace of mind)

Yo Force, check it out, man
It goes like this, like
It's like
Jawn P, he's got to have a peace of mind
MC Force, he's gotta have a peace of mind
Master G, he's gotta have a peace of mind
( Name ), yo, he's gotta have a peace of mind
( Name ), he's gotta have a peace of mind
( Name ), she gotta have a peace of mind
My girl Steph, she gotta have a peace of mind
( Name ), they gotta have a peace of mind
Mick Mick, he has to have a peace of mind
Yo Boston
Yo, we got a peace of mind</pre>
