Whoooo
Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto

[Chorus: Trey Songz 2X]
I'm from the motherfucking slums where the cops don't come
Turn the lights on and the bugs don't run
You ain't shit without no gun
In the ghetto [ghetto]
Ghetto [ghetto]

[1st verse]
I'm from where diapers full of feces
We's endangered species
Bodies lay in traffic, that's right, where the streets be
You ain't seen nothing this obscene from no TV
You would have to be me to feel what Obie's speaking
Bodies leak like steel pipes, it's real creepy
Ch-ch-ch-ha-ha-ha, Jason Vorhee's
You're boring me with your story, I'm a Detroitee
Craft took my mind so the craft exploits me

[Chorus]

[2nd verse]
I got no pot to piss in, en route to prison
You don't want it with us nigga, we strapped with nitroglicerin
Our ambitions is some riders, thriving off poor decisions
A blessing nigga still living, still pimping, still visions of
Sitting in that foreign whip, whipping up cola take a lick
To my tongue, numb from the shit
My nuts hung since I was a young one
And that's just the slum fuck of it
I'm pumped daddy gone but, gun in my palm
My momma can't save me her gender is wrong
On my own in this jungle that niggaz call home
What? His momma died from a lump in her D cup
Police freeze 'em up for serving these glucks
It's like a habitual situation, we stuck
The ritual is for niggaz to grab they nuts
And just soak all this bullshit up, where I'm from?

[Chorus]

[3rd verse]
I'm from real bridge cause, for niggaz living hard
Welfare scarers just most chicks'll buy them broad
Pimping the government cause government pimping us
Rather see 'em suffering then niggaz live it up
Cause you ain't heard? Bird got birds
But the nigga got murd' cause niggaz felt he ain't deserve
What he was worth, he ain't a real nigga from the turf
He was birth with money, that's why they left him bloody
I'm from the streets where most these niggaz nutty
I adapt to em, I'm exactly in tuned with 'em
Strapped with the Mac that extract flesh from humans
Home sweet home, better known as The Ruins

[Chorus]

Whoaa!</pre>
