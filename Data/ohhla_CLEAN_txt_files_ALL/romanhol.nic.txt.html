[Intro/Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Take your medication, Roman; take a short vacation, Roman
You'll be okay
You need to know your station, Roman
Some alterations on your clothes and, your brain
Take a little break, little break from your sovereignty
There is so much you can take, you can take, I know how bad you need
a Roman holiday - Roman holiday, a Roman holiday

[Nicki Minaj]
You done, you tight? You suck at life?
You don't want a round three? You done suffered twice?
W-w-w-orship the queen and you might could pass
Keep it real, these chicks couldn't wipe my huh
Anyway, stylist, go get Bulgari; I am the ultimate Svengali
You-you bitches can't even spell that
You-you hoes buggin, prppel that
Let me tell you this sister
I am, I am colder than a blister
Cause my flow's so sick and I'm a lunatic
and this can't be cured with no elixir
Cause y'all know who the fuck, what the fuck I do
I done put the pressure to every thug I knew
Quack quack to a duck and a chicken too
Put the hyena in a freakin zoo, BIM~!!

[Chorus]

[Nicki Minaj]
Witch! Twitch!
Bitch! Motherfuckin right, this is world war six
This right here might make a bitch die
And this right here gon' make a bitch cry
And if we bein honest, I am such a great guy
But guess what I do when a bitch break fly huh?
Nuh, nuh, nuh, na-nuh-na-nuh-nuh
Ah-huh di-duh, a-nuh-di-da-duh
I'ma put her in a dungeon under, under
No them bitches ain't eatin, they dyin of hunger
Motherfucker I'm meeeeeeee
Who the fuck is hoeeeeeeee?
And yes, maybe this a type of Tourette's
Get my wigs, Terrence, go and get my barrettes

[Chorus]

[repeat 3X]
Cummmm, all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
I am Roman 'til, I'm done

[Nicki Minaj]
Talkin 'bout me, you talkin about me?
I dare a motherfucker to be talkin about me~!!
Y'all bitches must be smokin a couple of O-Z
They want the outline, I give them a goatee
God damn motherfucker~! You talkin about me?
I dare a motherfucker to be talkin about me
Y'all bitches must be smokin a couple of O-Z
I nuh-nuh-nuh and give 'em a goatee
