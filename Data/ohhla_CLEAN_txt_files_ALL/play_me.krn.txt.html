[Nas]
Everybody's an Enemy
Telling me lies and it's killing me
Why they all want to get rid of me
Everybody's my enemy
Several try to disguise the devil in them
Wanting to get into my cerebellum but I'm
Ready and willing to tell them that I can't f with them
Exhale so hard it got my chest swelling
Like my dick does when watching naked women
Do sick stuff on my porn collection on television

[Chorus - Nas]
Trust nobody
I don't know who to call a friend
They all just pretend to be
Fuck Everybody this is to all of ya'll
Cuz everybody is an enemy
Trust nobody
I don't know who to call a friend
They all just pretend to be
Fuck Everybody this is to all of ya'll
Cuz everybody is an enemy

[Nas]
Watching my own back
Strapped in chrome, to my homies
Where the tombstones at, where the hoes at?
Cuz to many didn't act like dikes, hermaphrodites
With benzene, amen
Look at the trash they biting
The life in times is kinda weaker
Like the time and life of the sandman
On Apollo theater
Imagine that another black with a hook
Who pulls the wack talent off the stage
I'm enraged

[Chorus]

[Jonathan Davis]
You fill your lies around me
and you think you won
You feel you can control me
with the things you've done
You think you can take me
you think you can play me
you're going to start to hate me
I feel that you disgraced me [x5]

[Chorus]</pre>
