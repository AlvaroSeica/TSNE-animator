Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Faster
He did five, he got chill more to go he wish the ills can go faster
I'm moving blow, I'm the deep in the snow
You need it low the troll faster, go
I'm too impatient tryin to roll it up quick
But my bitch can roll faster
It's all good you wind me your old school
But my news can go faster

I'm in my class reunion and I'm pass the car
I'm the richest niggas here but I didn't pass the bar
I got a white so bright and make a cool proud applaud
Make account so stupid I got thank you Lord
I got a bitch so bad marry man the..
She a chop not shit G can't afford
I'm having so much jewelry at the vibal wars
And I'm bulled up from Friday to Friday but
Up the extraline nigga touch inside the..
Left Ferrari that your girlfriend round beside your boy
Remember when I first started they been... boy
And a nigga lost me likely 'cause he trush me boy

[Chorus]
Faster
He did five, he got chill more to go he wish the ills can go faster
I'm moving blow, I'm the deep in the snow
You need it low the troll faster, go
I'm too impatient tryin to roll it up quick
But my bitch can roll faster
It's all good you wind me your old school
But my news can go faster

I got niggas doing life you like they moving battles
Just thinking what I'm facing make me rapping faster
I still fernessing... and I'm on CD
A million dollar nigga and I'm still in the street
A free band boss yeah I cause shot
I bought a red rari could be out the pot
Gucci that my nigga we got street time
Everywhere you see me, you see plugs around
I keep my money bands but I spend it faster
Never seen it drive I got birds in the addict
I spin em miller weak, I got a lot of heavens
You say your flood take a weak, I got get em to you faster

[Chorus]
Faster
He did five, he got chill more to go he wish the ills can go faster
I'm moving blow, I'm the deep in the snow
You need it low the troll faster, go
I'm too impatient tryin to roll it up quick
But my bitch can roll faster
It's all good you wind me your old school
But my news can go faster

Everything moving fast hills poud to straight glass
Diamonds bricks and fake bell for the cash drawing down fast
Murder rate high shit, but them loan sticks uh shit
Runs world on six,.. free bricks
Prison time hell the slow, no parade home I'm ready to go
Got a five in, I'm a 15 hope to move fast he fit it low
LA need a fast car and... niggas don't play the bar
He the real face of the A as a... being low
You're the one that... on my feet
Two minutes on seats nigga riding with me
Don't take five hundred at least
Clear whole light..
Faster my nigga gonna script them pockets faster
And they gotta ask it and they gonna blast it so move faster

[Chorus]
Faster
He did five, he got chill more to go he wish the ills can go faster
I'm moving blow, I'm the deep in the snow
You need it low the troll faster, go
I'm too impatient tryin to roll it up quick
But my bitch can roll faster
It's all good you wind me your old school
But my news can go faster</pre>
