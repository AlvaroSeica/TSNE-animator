Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Forgive me for what I have done
Cause I'm young, yeah I'm young
Forgive me for what I have done
Cause I'm young, yeah I'm young

I don't mean to feded you off
It's just fun, it's just fun
I don't mean to feded you off
It's just fun, it's just fun

We live on the edge the life
We don't even compromise
We rush because we're out of time

Forgive us for what we have done
Cause we're young, we're young, we're young
I said forgive us for what we have done
Cause we're young, we're young, we're young

I make mistakes that I learn from
Cause I'm young, yeah I'm young
I'm sorry I'm not even dumb
Cause I'm young, yeah I'm young
Don't worry about what I'll become
It's just fun, it's just fun
It's just fun, it's just fun
I scream out the top of my lungs
It's just fun, it's just fun
It's just fun, it's just fun

We live on the edge the life
We don't even compromise
We rush because we're out of time

Forgive us for what we have done
Cause we're young, we're young, we're young
I said forgive us for what we have done
Cause we're young, we're young, we're young

We live on the edge the life
We don't even compromise
We rush because we're out of time

Forgive us for what we have done
Cause we young, we young, we young
I said forgive us for what we have done
Cause we young, we young, we young

We are young</pre>
