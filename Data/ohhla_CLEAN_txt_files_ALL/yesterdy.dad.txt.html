[Intro]
Yeah... yayyyyyy-yeah
Uhhhhh-uhhhh

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Yesterday I fell in love, today feels like my funeral
I just got hit by a bus, shouldn'ta been so beautiful
Don't know why I gave my heart, gave my trust, gave everything
You think that if I had the chance, to do it over again
I'd do something different, make better decisions
Save me from my ignorance
But I keep makin the same mistakes before I
I see the danger but I go forward
I'm sittin here tryin to keep my composure
Knowin inside I'm broken and to' up
She got me gone I'm on her like a drug
I try to go but end up wantin more
Stuck in my head, vivid as a picture
I wanna be clean but I can't get rid of herrrr

[Diddy] + (Chris Brown)
Uh! Give my all you take it from me (from me girl)
And don't even replace it for me (nooo)
I wish you'd just fake it for me (fake it)
I wish I can make you love me more
You can't tell I fucks wit'chu I needed you (needed you)
I thought that you understood that based on how I treated you (treated you)
I don't pay attention to the rumors that you feed into
Know you're missin somethin, I wish I was what completed you

[Chorus]

[Diddy] + (Chris Brown)
Uh yeah, I feel like a killer hit me (hit me)
The weapon was concealed initially (ohhh!)
But I felt so much pain from it (pain)
You deserved to feel it with me more (more)
I feel like I beg wit'chu I plead wit'chu (plead with you)
I don't comprehend how you can't love when it's so easy to (easy to )
I thought you could do it I believed in the naive in you (ohhh!)
I just need to breathe baby, now I got the freedom to

[Chris Brown]
She like a drug, yeahhh!
And I don't think I can get rid of her
Cause she got me in this curse
And then it dawned on me
I can't do nothin with her
What this woman's worth
I can't find my way out and it hurts
I tried but she won't let me go
She, won't let me go
She won't let me go
She, won't let me go
She won't let me GO! {*2X*}
Won't won't won't won't won't won't won't won't
Yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Whooooo-ahhhhh, yeahhhhh-hah
