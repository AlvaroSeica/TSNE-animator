[Intro]
Heh
Smile nigga, make your face feel good
Smile bitch~! Fuck you up

[Chorus: Lil' Fame]
What the fuck are you lookin for?
Can't a young nigga get money any more?
Screw up your face when you see Fitzroy
You get shot the fuck on up, bitch boy!
What the fuck are you lookin for?
Can't a young nigga get money any more?
Screw up your face when you see Fitzroy
You get shot the fuck on up!

[Lil' Fame]
Fall back in this bitch, like I came to get a boost
from one of y'all niggaz to help jumpstart my hooptie hoop
The wheels on this old-ass piece of shit
still rollin, I just needed some 10-Dub 40
Shorty, fall back, 'fore I fuck around
and pop a hot one plus eight up in your gut
I'll see you, up in ICU
with the motherfuckin Diggy Doc staple in your gut
Now why the fuck are you fuckin with me?
You ain't heard that I'm sufferin from a disease
called Leave-Me-The-Fuck-Alone?
The only way to cure it is to leave me the fuck alone!
It's the 13th letter (M) 15th letter (O)
16th letter (P) y'all niggaz know the acronym
I'm backed by them, read the murder report
Crashed around yo' ass sprawled out on the floor
It's

[Chorus: Lil' Fame]
What the fuck are y'all lookin for?!
Can't stomp a motherfucker out no more?
Tell the police it was them Mo. P boys
You get shot the fuck on up, bitch boy!
What the fuck are y'all lookin for?!
Never seen a nigga sprawled out homeboy
Screw up your face when you see Fitzroy
You get shot the fuck on up!

[Chorus 2X: Billy Danze]
GET YO' BITCH ASS OUTTA MY FACE
You fuckin with a nigga with no time to waste
(We get) hot on yo' ass, nigga cut to chase
(It's me) Coppertop to knock somethin out of place

[Billy Danze]
We need order 'round this motherfucker
'fore somebody get slaughtered 'round this motherfucker {*whistling*}
Who know the game, who bang, who aim for the sport
Who rearrange and change your whole frame of thought
And keep niggaz off balance
And silencers show niggaz raw talent
In violence who remind you of sin? (Mo. P'z)
Who remind you that Brooklyn's on the map baby? (Mo. P'z!)
We showed you how to grip quick from your hip click get at a nigga
in the center of his back baby (Mo. P'z)
Look tell him we are your providers
When you needed yo' ass whupped you ain't had to look hard to find us
I don't wanna hear about it how you got it (nigga)
Or which part of town you're supposed to be runnin (nigga)
The truth is we see through kids like you that's frontin
Your gangster ain't really that stunnin

[Chorus: Billy Danze]
What the fuck are you lookin for?
Can't shoot a motherfucker up no more?
Tell the police it was them Mo. P boyz
You get shot the fuck on up, bitch boy!
Now what the fuck are you lookin for?
Never seen a nigga sprawled out homeboy
Screw up your face when you see Bird Dog
You'll get shot the fuck on up!

[Outro: M.O.P.]
Yeah, hah~!!
Who need they ass whupped? (Hahaha)
Who want they motherfuckin ass whupped?
You get knocked the fuck on out (who wan' hold one of these)
You get knocked the fuck on out
You get knocked the fuck on out (bitch boy)
Get knocked the fuck on out (bitch boy!)
Hehehehehe, y'all know how the game go
NIGGA! NIGGA! NIGGA! NIGGA! NIGGA!

HAI! Oh, P, eh, heh, oh, hooo</pre>
