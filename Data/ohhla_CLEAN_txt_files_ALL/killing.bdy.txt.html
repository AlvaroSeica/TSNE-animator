[Intro: Unidentified Artist]
Ice can't fall, Ice keep on ball
And he who doesn't know will get involved
Last hope for the whitey folks
Ice came cursed, last hope for the whitey guy
Ice can't die

[Ice-T]
No!!
Help
It's the killing floor, killing floor
Yeah
Ah
Killing floor
No
Killing floor
Ah
Killing floor
Body Count motherfuckers</pre>
