[Werd]
Hello

[Doctor]
Just, Just come in

[Werd]
Hi Doc

[Doctor]
Hi How are.. Who are you sorry?

[Werd]
Court Sent me

[Doctor]
Oh yes involuntary sentence

[Werd]
Nah no voluntary, I'll take a seat though

[Doctor]
Yes I was about to say just take a seat and we can start to proceed
and see what exactly might be wrong with you

[Werd]
Nothing wrong with me doc, well...

I've got healthy mental problems 
And my mental health is shocking
You can tell it when I'm talking 
That I must be from Scotland [X2]

And they said that I need medicine
Go and get the medics in and pump me with adrenalin
Stick me with amphetamines and contact my next of Kin
He aint getting out for a long time get him in
Get his thoughts now on lock down
All locked up with thoughts we gone watch now
Put him on the right track don't let him write tracks
If he does that he'll be right back (right back)
Need to fight that don't be a shite bag
This is for own good and no you don't like that
Since the breakdown you've been a right bad
Writer with the white pad writing all this shite crap
And we know that your ill mate
But these pills aint the ones that you like mate
Mate mate stop calling me that
Cunt are you Werd or Drew I'm no follow that

I've got healthy mental problems 
And my mental health is shocking
You can tell it when I'm talking 
That I must be from Scotland [X2]

And they say I got split personality
Werd is fanny and Drew's got vanity
Ones got Stanley blades other got a salary
Works for his money other one just taxing you
And you can tell who I am
Cause that Werd mate he just raps like a bam
And I'm normal (normal) not Hag G
Because what's normal to you is not normal for me
And that's my problem my normality
To be a no friends Norman I normally be
So normal to me just storm in a tea
Cup cut fuck back on the beat
But wait wait need to get my act together
Werd and Drew been fight forever
Even though that my acts no together
S.O.S. mate the act is forever

I've got healthy mental problems 
And my mental health is shocking
You can tell it when I'm talking 
That I must be from Scotland [X2]

So they said Werd your better off here
And Drew you too since you keep him so near
Used to be seven thirty now quarter to eight
Now your way past that like the next day
Hey it aint so bad
But you must be crazy if you think you can rap
Perhaps should go and find a guitar
If you do that you'll be saner by far

Saner my arse who you talking to Drew
You thing your soft spoken they will listen to you
Cunt they ken who I am fuck the mad world pish
See I am a ghost your a default prick

Sorry for the outburst that was Werd
He had a breakdown before man you probably heard
And anyway he's no looking for pity
But its true he's the only one that's committed

I've healthy mental problems 
And my mental health is shocking
You can tell it when I'm talking 
That I must be from Scotland

I've got I've got 
no where you taking me
What I'm no going in there
