Typed by: Knowledge God

[Long Axe]
Y'all acting like Rae don't get my flesh
Like Axe don't feel these pain behind doors
Can't even trip and play the shit off
Flawless even with scars I want all of this
Won't remain carless, Chevy's and them parlours
Feet don't fail me now, we got to marvellous
I'm on my way to making very large dollars
Money upfront like the audience that hollers
Black low then high, aim for the sky
like the Fourth of July, the city fly like a drive-by
Hold tight to your Kangols
We about to put your mind where your body can't go
Arrange the position in the Range Rove
Comfortable now why we gotta change for

[Chorus]
Huh
Black low then high, aim for the sky
Dananannana Huh
Dananannana Huh
Huh, huh

[Long Axe]
Pick you up where I left you off
On the side of hard time right behind the corner store
What you want it for? Keeping it traditional?
Maybe if you want it more they will reposition you
Huh, I ain't even given them a hundred yet
Talking like a millionaire, don't even got my money yet
Shits gonna change, gonna stain the beat left
With the same damn things, it is all about the rest
Black low then high, aim for the sky
King C, Begga Ooh, Dragonfly outside
Toast of the Most High, Wu-chi won't die
Sean G a part of me, though you act so shy
Premonitions of a man, his position is a plan
Reposition your hand so you people understand

[Chorus]</pre>
