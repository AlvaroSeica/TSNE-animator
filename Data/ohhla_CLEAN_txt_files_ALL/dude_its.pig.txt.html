[Pigeon John]
We got the windows down
Mess up our hair and let it blow around
The music bangs out loud
Sittin on chrome and we're Westcoast bound
We got our shadies on
for good watchin up a Cinnabun
That sky is liquid blue
Go tell the homies that we comin thru
cause it's on

[Chorus]
Oh yeah it's on now
Baby yo, it's on now
Oh yeah, it's on
I can feel it washin over me
(And it's about to be on) Washin over me
(And it's about to be on, I can feel it)

La la-la la-la la..
La la-la la, la-la, la-la-la la..

[Pigeon John]
We at the Motel 6
Watchin some Conan, eatin Chick-o-Stix
The homies bringin some brew
We crack 'em open and we do what we do
cause it's on

[Chorus]

La la-la la-la la..
La la-la la, la-la, la-la-la la..

[Pigeon John]
We got the windows down
Mess up our hair and let it blow around
The music bangs out loud
(Rollin on hubcaps and we're West Coast bound)

[Chorus]</pre>
