(Yo yo)
Bury you with satan
(Peep the death rap)
Bury you with satan
Death is in your future

Im gettin outrageous on you, pullin razors on you
Blazin on you, twelve gauges on you
Amazin the ways I print your veins on you
Ill warn you I'll bring euthanasia upon you
On some shocking asia shit
Split your face and spit on your corpse, you're a goner
Wrapped stabbed flesh juxed quick and grab your neck
Bludgeon you bloody, buddy you stupid what's after death?
You must be after gettin half your body cut in half
and after the aftermath of the bloodbath I'll have my laughter
You stupid fucks'll catch crew cuts
A chainsaw'll take the top of your brain off
Stabbin the two nuts of a Ku Klux - with scalpels
My rap'll leave you shackled
My rap is like crack inside a capsule
I'll shove an axe in you where your axel
Your main point your midsection where your ribs are flexin
Infested with injections you can't get rid of the infection
Kid you're destined for the death
Dead walkin, flesh exertin
Walkin through the streets dressed - being a corpse is next
Make a mistake a blade'll take ya life away
Leave you decayed inside a lake and break your neck down to your spinal blade
The gore shit I kick is sick cause I'm a bitter kid
I'll stick and vic you bitch
RIP you to pieces - pick you out a ditch
Go devour dick you coward
Catch a thousand hits around your skull
You won't get yourself know it bitin our shit
Niggas know who did it - kid you did it
Kickin it like you bit it - you never lived it
Kick in his head til it splitted
Open and liquid soakin a hemoglobin ocean
You're a victim, you're no one
I see him scopin - I choke him

(Hook) x4
Bury you with satan
Bury you with satan
Death is in your future

You're in for it
My sins are horrid explore it - cause death is torrid
You'll be dead for it - endure it
Morbid cold like Nordic
The hydrochloric - pour it
Onto your arm, it's all so much it melt the skin right off it
Right to the bone - forfeit
I offer you morphine and a chance to escape a coffin
Enter my auction
Become a slave I got nuns depraved
Under my cave I got a hundred ways to murder all of you gays
I'm ambitious for leavin you in stitches
I won't give up hope, seeing you hang from a rope - achieve my goal
Let the meat cleaver unfold
You traveled a great distance
And you still ain't sadistic - wait for assistance
You'll hate your own existance
Persistance overcomes resistance
When I persist to bash my fist in your face from instinct

(Hook) x5
