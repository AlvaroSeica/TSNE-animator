[Intro: King Just]
May day, may day, danger, danger
The lone ranger stranger
Knocking phony rappers off a pedestal

[Chorus: King Just]
Just because you got chips, that don't mean shit
Just because you got stacks, that don't mean jack
Just because you get paper, that don't make you a player
Come off that high horse!

[King Just]
After this one, niggas gon' pick up they pen again
All hail, when you see the real rap veteran
Better than, any fucking rapper you can bring about
Swiss ross, handwash, spin dry, air 'em out
No doubt, this rapper here sold out
From every fucking record store you stole out
Choke out, every label exec', for not giving Who You respect
Had rubberbands checked
Check yourself before you tamper with ours
It takes a small man to be a big bully, you coward
Devour, the knowledge to the game, I guess I'm to blame
When niggas start shitting on my name
Compare the dollars to the fame, but it's not the same
On your mark, get set, go, and the dough is to aim
Claim turf like Captain Kirk, No Power on Earth
You RuPaul rappers better work, jerk

[Chorus 2X]

[King Just]
High ho silver, let me guess, that's platinum
And you must be the baboon, goons is backing 'em
Acting and, like you don't know what's happening
The rowdy Staten Islanders is back again
Tell a friend to tell a friend, to fax it in
With an R&amp;B wifey like Biggie and Mack 10
Back then I couldn't picture that, with a Kodak
Too busy running from this bald head cop named Kojak
Sold crack to make a buck or two, fuck you
If you can't relate, what a starving artist been through
Chopped you like gensu, hang that ass like tensil
And stab instrumentals with a number two pencil
Avenge you, Who You's the label, now shout out
Full moon'll have niggas surround you, that's bout it
Outed, from the doorstep with a war rep
And most of them slept, where there jaw was last left

[Chorus]

[King Just]
What goes up, must come down
Been to every, how can I be down and still ain't down
What now, do I step down, and hand my crown down
Hell no, clown, I pump sounds through the underground
Run now, before you get, runned down, gunned down
From every shell in my round, feel like a beatdown
Eat now, cuz later we gon' still be hungry
And I don't want your money, money, get it straight
I could wait, til they put food on my plate
And it be my turn to burn, for ten years straight
Debate, while I hit the fifty-two states
And polly with the kids behind the black iron gate
Hoping we see the pearly ones, but not early, son
Until then I'm trapped on this Island like Gilligan
Back to the Hill again, it's real again
With some unfamiliar faces and few fake friends
Here's a message that I send, while you see me in The Source
You had yours, now it's mine, get off that high horse
Here's a message that I send, while you see me in The Source
You had yours, now it's mine, get off that high horse

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
