Song:   To Be a Man
Typed by: trustthebuzzinc@gmail.com

*Chorus x2*
Trust is/ something that's earned in this world of pain
So many died from the money pretty girls and fame
Trying to survive yo we gotta maintain/
It's so hard to be a man/ here me say

*Verse1*
Living by the devil's doctrine/ murders and metal sparking
Tearing our face apart for some cheddar in our pockets
Rich like Liberachi diamond bezels in our watches
Fucking dimes intoxicated while the devils watching
Shadow boxing with myself while the devil's watching
Can't shake the feeling the government's spying on me
The path to stardom/ Mazeratti's and Aston Martins
Shit I used to dream about when my ass was starving
Relied on my survival instincts/ to dig myself out the bottom percentage
Tearing up the bar full of bottles of liquor/ man's biggest weakness
Drugs, money and the women/ with thick features
Lusting for more power/ insatiable from making love
To my shorty to dousing her with golden showers
Moving closer to my final hour/ watching my life
Flash in front of my eyes a hundred miles per hours

*Chorus*
* *
* Verse 2*
Living in a world of tyranny kind of nice isn't he?
Bullshit and bright lights and Zeitgeist conspiracies
Thoroughbreds that are freaky give me head when they see me
Rub the head of a genie to get that fettuccini
Moving through Illuminati in a blue Ducatti
Niggas shooting through the lobby bullets ringing through your body
Body snatchers that'll end you with a shotty blast
And throw your whole swag inside of a body bag
In dollars we trust/ corruption of the human mind
Shit is do or die can lead you to a suicide
Since a juvenile no limits what we do to shine
For reputation, money and the pussy niggas doing time
Fuck earning a decent living/ Ferraris and the Benzes
And the baddest of the baddest dimes turn to easy women
Nasty and freaky women that'll do just about anything
To get a little glimpse of that easy living

*Chorus*
*Verse 3*
The aura of a pharaoh I'm a king in his essence
In a world where man's measured by the things he possesses
And the women he blesses since adolescence I learn
That with fortune came a crime had to sin for the cheddar
Chased it like a dog and it made me depressive
Then I expressed on a beat and it made me a Legend
Woke up now we too smart to fall for the lie
Put our hearts in it too hard for yall to deny
Using us as an experiment/ poisoning our medicine
Put guns in our hands pop toys for the hell of it
Me and money get along/ I hear voices in my head
Serenaded by the devils song
Stuck in this predicament/ hard to get up out it
And when the metal's drawn you gotta react
No time to think about it/ and it's a vicious cycle
Downward spiral/ we crabs in a bucket in this world for survival</pre>
