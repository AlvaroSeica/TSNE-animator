[Intro]
Uh! Uh! Yeah! T-I-T-O
My mama to be proud of me, I just want my mama to be proud of me that's all I want
I just want my mama to be proud of me, I just want my mama to be proud of me

[Verse One]
HUH! I do it like this for a reason
'Cause if you stop to beat it don't feel like I'm fuckin breathin
Get neither for your treason I'm squeezin my whole life into a verse  
In the studio itchin to fix your lil' mic in a hearst
And a worst case, scenari-o you know it gets scary
Well loaded in this motherfucker they 'gon laugh at you carry
I'm very sick, I might throw up
Grenades and lemonades for lunch nigga makin sure I blow up
I can't slow up, too busy bleedin the brakes
And I stay in my lane 'cause I don't wanna be with the fakes
Call a snitch T.D. whether they be with the Jakes
See how niggas is rats, too busy feedin the snakes
I got, aches and pains from bein boxed in
Locked in my firm spot in the fuckin top ten
And you tryin to push the envelope get you a stamp then
Pops gave me that belt, I guess that means I'm champ then
RIGHT!!!!

[Chorus]
And I just want my mama to be proud of me
I just want my mama to be proud of me that's all I want
And I just want my mama to be proud of me
I just want my mama to be proud of me that's all I need
And I just want my mama to be proud of me
I just want my mama to be proud of me that's all I want
And I just want my mama to be proud of me
I just want my mama to be proud of me 

[Verse Two]
OK! Trill at the wheel, let me let my seat back
Adjust the mirror for niggas so I could peep back
Start with Lucious Left, left off with three stacks
Three lax, peel off then lead tracks ease back
And these back pains I handle a different way
I stay Icy Hot, these niggas Ben Gay
And since they feel the need to question whether he's real
I stopped before they start like a plan b pill
Bitch I'm the answer, question, who's the truest?
Still the answer, question, who's the newest?
Knew this, the way I let it all hang out
Rope chain make a noose homey chill hang out
They need a hero so I suited up and came out
Show the dame how she came in once I came out
Yeah! Tito Lo the name you should know
If you don't fuck with me you know where you can go
NIGGA!

[Chorus]:
And I just want my mama to be proud of me
I just want my mama to be proud of me that's all I want
And I just want my mama to be proud of me
I just want my mama to be proud of me that's all I need
Said I just want my mama to be proud of me
I just want my mama to be proud of me that's all I want
Man!  I just want my mama to be proud of me
I just want my mama to be proud of me 

[Verse Three]
Huh! Damnit! Was on the way home and crash landed
Stranded, fuck the planet if they don't understand it
And my crew, I got it branded
That's just the way that love goes, it's thugged out, forgive me Janet 
Man it's unlikely see me this weak on these beats 
Comin from these streets I'm stretchin three hundred for three weeks
And these freaks wanna play chess, with they sex 
I tell a bitch to, Skip like Bayless to Payless before I say yes
Comments from common niggas, thinkin they commentators
But y'all ain't commentators y'all niggas is common haters
Watts told me to keep the energy flowin I listened
Mississippi power really my only competition
I see you fishin for greatness in the wrong water
Ain't caught a part of a starter for your team, play it smarter
I see alot of Marlons, I don't see no Michaels
One love in my one glove
HA!!!!!!!

[Chorus]
And I just want my mama to be proud of me
I just want my mama to be proud of me that's all I want
UH! I just want my mama to be proud of me
I just want my mama to be proud of me that's all I need
Said I just want my mama to be proud of me
I just want my mama to be proud of me that's all I want
UH! I just want my mama to be proud of me
I just want my mama to be proud of me 
HUH!

[Outro]
T-I-T-O!!! Uh! G-P-T! Y'all know how we do
I just want my mama to be proud of me
UH! I just want my mama to be proud of me
I just want my mama to be proud of me 
HUH!</pre>
