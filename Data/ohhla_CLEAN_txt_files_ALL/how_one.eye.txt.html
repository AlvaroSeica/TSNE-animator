I'm here to break my own ball and chain
Hoping the ?? to be completely sane
Nothings to gain if image blocks the only chance for change
When I expand my range the world shares it's judges
But don't think music defines my care
These songs ain't me, they're just documentations of momentary thoughts
Nothing's set in stone just because it's sold or bought
Your expectations need a catergory of placement
But a renasance man sits nowhere particular
Every seed is vacant to a song writer, comedian, ??
actor, author, emcee, carpenter, producer, engineer, shit talker
Hustler, musician, architect, businessman
student of the seed and human being if you give a damn
No matter what side you see it's only one side
No matter how much you think it means, it's just one side
My depth is only as shallow as time and space
This is just one of my eternally changing...</pre>
