Song:   Untouchable Part 1
Typed by: timmy.bogenburt@gmail.com

Ooh here I come, not what you expected
Y'all erected while I wreck shit, next bit hard while I wreck it
Elected prom queen on the strength of my last record
Hectic, get nekkid and do it backstage after y'all exit
About three minutes start counting back seconds
I got sexists begging me to make me breakfasts
Winnipeg to Texas, Easter egg to X-mas
Ass in excess make them other senseless girls look anorexics
Ain't nobody can do what I do, can't have what I have, untouchable, don't be mad
If naughty girls need love too then I guess I'm bad
I flow like Maxi Pad, magic Alad it's just some crazy spark I always had
Y'all are gonna feel like Chris Columbus when you discover me
Under the covers undercover in reverie readily I'd say I was bigger than Jesus
Save the formal apology for my Anthology and Regis

[7Even]
Stand off, hands off, the Princess resussin' y'all
Fresh air in the game, hands off she's untouchable
Untouchable what, untouchable what, untouchable what, untouchable

I'm the finest of the best and if that don't make sense
Who cares look at how I dress and if that don't make sense I'm gonna talk about you in past tense
And if that don't make sense, fuck you I'm a go smoke sens
Don't start a fight with me I don't care, I'll bite your teeth
Get in ya shit like a colostomy impossible to complete with me
A Prophecy, I'm gonna own everything like I was an apostrophe
Number one on Billboard, a record of just me coughing see
To heck with ya I'm kickin' non-sequiturs
To all my competitors so out your range don't give a what if I'm strange
Come up to my room D'Angelo, I want to bite your abdomen
What, have fun, crush you lyrically like Neil Carter mixed with Big Pun and Run
Never outdone, shinin' charisma only one star can outshine and that's the sun (and that's a big one)

[7Even]
Stand off, hands off, the Princess resussin' y'all
Fresh air in the game, hands off she's untouchable
Untouchable what, untouchable what, untouchable what, untouchable

I got a vision itchin' to be an imposition
Invadin' domes and homes like a religion inquisition
A juxtaposition, let's fuck, you pick the position
Holdin' the front of the fridge bangin' your bitch in the kitchen
Diamond in the rough, I'm rough on the diamond
Gotta be nice if you want in the hymen
If you an MC you better be nice when you rhymin'
And if you get me a seltzer it better have a lime and um
Memorize the name the Superstar, open your big mouths only if you about to go Rarrrr
On the one's, two's, three's and five's, no 1200's, I got 12, 000's and I mean guys
Easy on the eyes, I can't lie, get high from rhymes to you know what I'm tight
What a lady, what a night, oooh
And if you think this song is through, there's Untouchable Part 2

Untouchable in the 4x4, untouchable, you know I got more
Untouchable, and that's how we raw, and that's how we raw, and that's raw

Untouchable in the 4x4, untouchable, you know I got more
Untouchable, and that's how we raw, and that's how we raw, and that's raw

Untouchable in the 4x4, untouchable, you know I got more
Untouchable, and that's how we raw, and that's how we raw, and that's raw

Untouchable in the 4x4, untouchable, you know I got more
Untouchable, and that's how we raw, and that's how we raw, and that's raw</pre>
