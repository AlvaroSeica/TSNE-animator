I'm back but chill, homegirls don't mob me
You all can slob me down but don't rob me
I'm Super Lover so come one at a time
Because when it comes to crowds, I bust rhymes
To open em up, synchronize so precise
to make my jams... nice
Take off my pouch, then cold chill on my couch
So into me cause I'm relaxin, I'm no slouch
when it comes to a break, a funky dope pump take
Just press it on material, let it relate
to the partyin crowd as we're kickin it loud
No need to hide the pride, Super Rud feel proud
It's..

	Super - Casanova! (4X)

Now the troopers call me Super superb Lover superial
I'm known for pumpin the dope on record material
Rappers I'm runnin em, girls I'm confrontin em
I've got so many but only do love but one of them
So, to any girl on the street, who try to pass me
I say alright and just cold bust the whole chassis up
Heard me on the radio, now the tables turn
Said he's awesome but I lost him, so now you learn
that ain't no time for frontin and cold stereotypin
Get down on the Lover because I'm Super and hype and
up the atmosphere for entertainin the crowd
Super Rud's here to do it again, and feel proud
It's..

	Super - Casanova! (2X)

Here's a secret don't ruin it, I'm puttin you on it
Claim I never cheated on girls, meanwhile I'm doin it
I'm charmin and dashin, beautiful smashin
Always known for juicin girls in a orderly fashion
Huh, that's why they're pickin it, because I'm kickin it
When it comes to girls I only like em if I'm stickin it
Mmmm, it's only right because I claim my love is Super
They're on the jock you know just what I'm sayin trooper
Performer from Astoria, yes I'm an historian
High established rapper so I'm valedictorian
Fly and live the life just like a real smooth brother
Bad on the mic and I'm a cold stone Lover
It's..

	Super - Casanova! (2X)

Yo stop the beat and cuts before we startin em
For all interferin MC's, let's not pardon em
Cause I'm chumpin em, my jams I'm thumpin em
Girls act stupid-aly, when I'm pumpin em
Starin up a crowd, don't need to be harassin me
I don't have audacity to pull a weak capacity
Finale in show, but I'm prolonging the length
Don't ask did you rock em Sup', cause on the strength
this mic is forever mine, so have a clever rhyme
When the other brothers rockin, pay em no nevermind
Cause I can clock ya, rappin and rock ya
.. that's how I locked ya on
So now you're linked, people grow fond of you
Flash the Sup' jacket, they start to rendezvous
Rushin up to us, as they pursue us
Say who's these frontin mothersuckers claimin they knew us
Hmm that made em leary, I guess I learied em
Spacin em out, just like a planetarium
Kicked it loud, but cold kept the crowd
Don't need to hide the pride, the Super Rud feels proud
It's..
