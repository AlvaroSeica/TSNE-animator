[Intro: Buddha Monk]
They ain't know?
Buddy Love, Buddha Monk
Fat Tone Records, Duck-Lo Records
Agent Stealth, Mr. Tibbs, Captain Save-A-Hoe

[Buddha Monk]
Yo, let's get the party started, it's Duck-Lo and Fat Tone
You disrespect that, someone be knocking at ya home
Come to, show these cats, real raps and real gats
No need for you to fill out, unless we at the party you at
I'm a made cat, we strictly love Buddha Black
Big cootie from the back, hold on it like Thundercats
No party done, unless Duck-Lo get crunk
Fat Tone get crunk, Buddy Love gets crunk

[Yung Budd]
Aiyo, eyes all chinky, can't do me
Guess who stepped in, L-O-V-E
First name, Budd, you know who I...
Aiyo, Buddha (How you do it, Budd?) We stay high
Bottle popping ain't only expected
We don't even hit the library if our gats ain't packing
Dough ain't stacking, if the bar ain't bought out, word is bond, we coat jacking

[Chorus: Buddha Monk (Yung Budd)]
Aiyo, we got dough (got dough) Got cheese (got cheese)
(We do it up for the Fat Tone family)
Aiyo, we got dough (got dough) Got cheese (got cheese)
We do it up for the Duck-Lo family

[Buddha Monk]
You could holla at ya boy if the Price is Right
Nigga, I used to use ya money to pay for that ice
Spit sixteen, need for sixty thou' of them things
Now I'm living a little closer to an Iverson dream
Duck-Lo in the bing, off with ya girl or ya dreams
She said she loved the way I made her ting-a-ling-a-ling
Don't hate the player, just hate that I played ya
I'm a all-star major, read in every paper
Loose lips don't sink ships on park bench
Get you stuck up and robbed for yo' whip
I stay drunk but never slip, armed with my clips
Surround ya whole house, you be like "Huh? What's this?"
It's me, Daddy Warbucks, shutting up yo' what what?
Taking the streets from all you punk fucks
Fifty/fifty love won't get you drippy-drippy blood
My sticky-sticky rug, chalk with ya presents

[Chorus 2 2X: Buddha Monk (Yung Budd)]
Aiyo, we got dough (got dough) Got cheese (got cheese)
We do it up for the Duck-Lo family
Aiyo, we got dough (got dough) Got cheese (got cheese)
(We do it up for the Fat Tone family)

[Yung Budd]
Aiyo, we back on the scene, Budd and 'Bucks
Got dough, stack chips, ladies call me Ush
I get the butts, and my ear stay gleaming
Three-way ring and, chicks want semen
Infrared beaming, cuz if you sticking me
I tell ya boys, "Get naked, down on ya knees"
Bound to squeeze, we see y'all rolling, pounds
All iced out, gambling, holding it down
Firebird with trucks, Fat Tone and 'Bucks
Slumped in the trunk, filling Phillie with chunks
You know I never talk madness, cuz I'm more quiet
When we busting that, yo that's a wrap
Come and check me now (Brooklyn)
We ain't riding with clowns, got shit now
Feel me, niggaz? And when we coming on, we coming on with the get down

[Chorus]

[Outro: Buddha Monk]
Niggaz...</pre>
