[Intro: Truck]
It's Truck, Ruthless Bastardz
Cue Trax, let's go

[Truck]
I hope I got your attention, man, pardon me
Hot 97, blazing hip hop and R&amp;B
Megatron, from the 9, yea you know the AM
It's Truck, I'm on the block, causing massive mayhem
Ruthless, pop your head off, I represent
All them other wack stations, they making cents
The hot lines off the hook, there's no way you can stop it
Call up, Megatron, number one, with the topics
You the streets right now, and they feeling you bad
Can't wait for the weekend, the weekdays are sad
Coming home late night from dancing in the club
Radio blasting, man sitting on dubs
Is you really tuned in, do I need to say more?
Don't touch that dial, Megatron, coming on at 4</pre>
