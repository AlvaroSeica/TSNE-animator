[Tyler, the Creator]
Hello, the hype is so mellow
Bitch I'm dope but my pipe is so yellow
with blue polka dots, pink stripes and it's pink on the title
Nigga fuck your role model bitch, I'm my own idol and
If you can't face it my nigga you can ass it
Might accessorize accessories bring out my assets
Nigga this sound on acid, tablets
Stussys G-Shock with my custom pair of 3D glasses
I suffer from ADHD
I should win a fucking award for being me
Beat bangin the tom-toms
My producer selection is fresh nigga, fuck Vons
Ace the Underdog, thrown them on the back bender
cause I change my outfit more than transsexuals change gender
Eatin Belgian waffles with Italian biscotts
I sold my soul to the devil for thirty percent off
And to you emo kids who walk around pissed off
Step 1: pull your panties down and start to piss off
Step 2: run to your radio, turn this shit off
Nigga didn't bother, so my father didn't help
So when my mom would beat my ass, she would always hit me with Gucci belts
Gucci imprint from leather welts, uh-huh, yeah
Ace, the Creator man! Uhh
Casey Veggies yo~! Uh-huh
Odd Future nigga, get used to it
Uhh, let me ay I'ma slow it down real quick for you
Look

[Tyler, the Creator]
I'm so dapper man, funky fresh Dapper Dan
I'm your favorite rapper, fan it's an honor to shake my hand
On +Award Tour+, on +Excursions+
I'm a virgin of swap meets
I'm so pure, so sick it's no cure
I'm dope, where the fiends at?
Aight, where the jeans at?
The hat, the crew, the t-shirt is Supreme, uhh

[Casey Veggies]
And they see me they play Pictionary
I got a good way with words like a dictionary
And in that dictionary my name is by "Fresh"
They at the same spot they makin no progress
Becoming a good rapper ain't that easy of a process
Eargasms they have them
The hotels we stayin in twelve star
Tyler say "Yo Casey just write a twelve bar"
If I'm with twelve people, I'm with twelve stars
You haters put up your guards
They against us? Oh no
