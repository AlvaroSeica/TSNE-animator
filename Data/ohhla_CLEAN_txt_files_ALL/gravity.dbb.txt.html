[Y-Tee]
Is it East and West? I ask you original the best
Well I don't know what's with all this stress
Got up in the morning many man a contest
And so I think 'em 

Hook:
Everybody want the same thing one day 
Everybod want to be number one    (x2)
Rudebwoy you wanna be number one
I'm gonna run it down the line one time

[Lee Majors]
We in this modern day Babylon with empty palms
I think about my last dollar while you hollar for these rap songs
I'm in my Eden when I rap about what I believe in
No deceivin' Illuminati got that ass thinkin'
Should I even rap or will I ever blow
Or should I take the loot I got and call a cab and go
Cause now-a-days you can't smile up in your video
I'm livin' off sour milk and cold cereal
My moms stated that life is what you make it
Hold everyday sacred I'm filled with such hatred
Cause a lot of niggas in the east don't represent 
And out west I saw a few that was fraudulant
Hesitant to give a man a pound and step
Cause when your songs don't bump
they look through that ass like fish net
With no respect how could you look up at the mirror 
The world is lookin' shadey and the futures no clearer

Hook

[Y-Tee]
Now as dem rumors done spreadin' I want a single now-a-day
Everybody want to the king but no man want to work ?

Hook

[Mr. Man]
It's time to invent the future cause there ain't nobody else
Who can make it happen right so make it happen for yourself
Instead of stressin' everything the next man got 
And trying to blow up the next mans' spot 
And always actin' like you got a whole lot
When the fact is you're trying to be something you're not
Yo if you don't cut it out you're gone be forgot
Cause the madness got to stop
See life is kinda stressful 
So many twist and turns it's like you walkin' on a pretzel
Yet and still I swear to build by any means 
Mr. Man and Nine Ether represent for Elohim
And you don't stop

Hook

[Lee Majors]

It's what it means to me.
It's like that ch'all. It's like gravity. </pre>
