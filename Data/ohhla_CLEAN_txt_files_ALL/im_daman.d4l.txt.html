[Chorus]
Bitch I'm the man, I, I, I'm the man
Got no wife but the white be my girlfriend
Got no wife but he white be my girl...
Got, got, no wife but the wife be my girlfriend

I don't know what y'all been told
Shawty Lo got coke and that's what's up that's what's happennin
And you know I keep work
Seventeen five same color t-shirts what's happennin

I'm the man
Bitch I'm the man
Got no wife but the white be my girlfriend

I'm hustlin
Got units in the city
If you want it come and get it "ha ha" work "whoa"

Bitch I'm the man
I, I, I'm the man
Got no wife but the white be my girlfriend
Got no wife but the white be my girl
Got, got no wife but the white be my girlfriend

Bitch I'm the man
I, I, I'm the man
Got no wife but the white be my girlfriend

Bitch I'm the man
I, I, I'm the man
I, I, I'm the man
I, I, I'm the man

[Verse 1]
Don't look suprised they can't hold me
I'm like oil base, I'm hard to lock up
You can meet me still hard to lock up
Hit the westside I made them stand up
CEO, colonel, whatever they call me
Niggaz gain weight
They obese
They done got fat
Its that time jenny craig got that Shawty Lo crack
Whoa made them stop that
They don't want that
D4L made them suckas lean back, way back
Cause I'm the man
Yea bitch I'm the man
Catch me in the club poppin rubberbands cause I can
I like to stunt a lot
See me in the parking lot
645 roof gone, Yea I dropped the top

[Chorus]
Bitch I'm the man
I, I, I'm the man
Got no wife but the white be my girlfriend

Bitch I'm the man
I, I, I'm the man
I, I, I'm the man
I, I, I'm the man

Bitch I'm the man, I, I, I'm the man
Got no wife but the white be my girlfriend
Got no wife but the white be my girl...
Got, got, no wife but the wife be my girlfriend

[Verse 2]
The cars, the hoes
The life I chose
The ice is froze
My flow is cold
I'm hot fa sho
You know its snow
I been getting money way back in 94'
The base, my trap
And you know it be on fire
D4L ain't gettin money?
Thats a Motherfucking lie
I already got money
Cant you look at me dummy?
I'm laced head to toe
Look at the way your hoe chosed
Bank roll unfold I made it rain on them hoes
04 4 door double 0 on them hoes
Bubble kush I blow
Leave the smell on your clothes
I'm gettin money in the hood and you already know
Whoa!

[Chorus]
Bitch I'm the man, I, I, I'm the man
Got no wife but the white be my girlfriend
Got no wife but the white be my girl...
Got, got, no wife but the wife be my girlfriend

Bitch I'm the man
I, I, I'm the man
Got no wife but the white be my girlfriend

Bitch I'm the man
I, I, I'm the man
I, I, I'm the man
I, I, I'm the man

Bitch I'm the man, I, I, I'm the man
Got no wife but the white be my girlfriend
Got no wife but the white be my girl...
Got, got, no wife but the wife be my girlfriend</pre>
