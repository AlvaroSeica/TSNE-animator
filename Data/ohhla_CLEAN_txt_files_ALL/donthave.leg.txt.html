[L.E.G.A.C.Y - Intro]
Suicide, it's a suicide, uh
Suicide, it's a suicide, uh
Suicide, it's the suicide

If I...put a Gillette to my wrist
If I, kill myself, who would really give a shit? - NOT ONE
I should kill myself with Pac's gun 
That would mean somethin' {*two gunshots*}
That'll mean sum'hin
I'm done with this life, slice 'til I'm done with this life
A bloody mess on my wrist 'til I'm done with death
The Grim Reaper, at the front door, I greet ya
"Hey, how ya doin?" Wit a blade so soothin
Cut the varicose, me nd my family never close
That gives me more reason, just look at me bleedin
There's red everywhere, pieces of L.E.G. everywhere
The puzzles scattered, can't be put back together
FUCK YOU, BASTARDS! This'll show you I'm clever
Start a trend of suicides like the movie Heathers
Tell Tracey I'm sorry, tell the baby I'm sorry
Just couldn't keep up with all these people tryna keep us

[Chorus]
Nah...'cause I don't have to stay here
Uh...
You can't keep me 'cause I don't have to stay here
Nah...'cause I don't have to stay here
Uh...
You can't keep me 'cause I don't have to stay here

Here's to whom it may concern, in hell I'ma burn
Remember that song, by B.I.G.?
"Suicidal Thoughts" Ready to D-I-E
You know that one part when he was like "I'm sick of talkin!"
Well right now, shit I'm sick of talkin
Wait, you still there? 'Cause I hung up yet
(Hey, you still there?) 'Cause the noose ain't strung up yet
Hang myself, like my video or somethin
Cobain myself, got out wit a shotgun bustin
Milwaukee Buckshots, "L.E.G. blew his fuckin top"
It was the headline, what was goin through L.E.G.'s mind?
Possessed by the evil, and now what about his people
Grow tired of stress, the pressure, tired of debt
So self-execution was the only solution
It's over, thoughts devily the stressin me
It's over, 'cause L.E.G.A.C.Y killed L.E.G.A.C.Y</pre>
