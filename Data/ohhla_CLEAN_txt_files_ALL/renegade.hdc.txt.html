{*"For the world's heavyweight championship"*}
{*"Where my soldiers at?"*}

[J Criminology]
While the dark lords sit on their throne
And plot to manipulate the institutionalized masses
  {*"Where my soldiers at?"*}
A renegade army of warriors is building strength
from the four corners of the globe
  {*"Where my soldiers at?"*}
Learning the language
  {*"Where my soldiers at?"*}
Exposing the infiltrators
And drawing on help from multiple dimensions
An army led by the last champions
The liberation process is in full effect
SOLDIERS~! Witness the strength
  {*"Where my soldiers at?"*}
Witness the strength {"soldiers"}
Witness the strength {"soldiers"}
Witness the strength {*"soldiers"*}
Witness the strength
