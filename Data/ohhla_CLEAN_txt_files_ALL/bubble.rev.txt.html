[Intro: The Reverend William Burk]
Yeah, bubble bath, baby
Burk, drop that beat
Word, word
Like that, like this
Yo

[The Reverend William Burk]
I used to French kiss her luscious lips and grab her hips
This chick was so thick that it was sick
I nearly had a fit when I seen her, black senorita
Met her back in 93 or maybe it was 94
I told her I was ill and that her body was the cure
I could tell she had taste by the clothes that she wore
High heels with open toes, so you could see her pretty black feet
Skirt with a slit down the middle made me happy
Picture perfect, you should have seen the way she worked it
I flirted with her all night long, and didn't stop until she told me I could give her a call
I hit her up the next week, we conversated till dawn
The first day followed, and she looked just like a model
I loved the way it wobbled, but her head wasn't hollow
Her motto was "Live for today, not just tomorrow"
But when I looked her in the eyes I could feel her sorrow
As we sat across from one another with the table in between
I could tell that this Queen had been played a couple times
She said a man always played games with her mind
And everytime she trusted him, she ended up bustin him
But she was in love with him, so she stayed with him
And every night she laid with him, thinking how she was getting played by him
And eventually she started hate the man
This is where the story gets ill
I thinkin to myself "Chill!", cause I don't wanna get all in her grill
But I know the deal, she likes getting dark
Then that's for real, it was just an energy that I could feel
Her scarred heart was bleedin, and she never let it heal
She wanted what she couldn't have, I took a sip from my drink
Sat back and laughed, picturin how she would look up in a bubble bath
Nahmean?

[Chorus: The Reverend William Burk]
Why they want what they can't have?
Why they want what they can't have?

[The Reverend William Burk]
You know how Burk went to work now, I said "Forgive me,
I have so many styles", I was playin Sade on surround sound
As I broke it down, still the King, still holdin the crown
Still making 'em sing, still pulling her hair, still spanking the back
As time went on, in fact she bacame a test
Now this is where I had to go hard, I had to be the God, I told her it would never work out
What are the odds that a brother like me and a sister like her could ever
get together for a future that was brighter
I told her I was no good, I'd only do her wrong and she know I would
So it was on, she loved that same old song, she loved that same old bond
And that same old relationship Where her man never came home till the break of dawn
And always did her wrong, but I had to go strong
Because I knew she wanted what she couldn't have, now you do the math
I laugh, took a sip of my drink and laid back with my shorty up in the bubble bath
Nahmean?

[Chorus]

[The Reverend William Burk]
Even though you say you love me, you can't handcuff me
I tried to keep a distance, she was persistent
Callin me, telling me how she desired all of me
But I was happy with the current arrangement
Shorty's talkin engagement, that's just not happenin
I like the way you work it in the bubble bath, but after it you gotta leave
That dream, I shattered it, left it in pieces, yo it's hazardous
To mess with these unstable creatures, I'm always looking for a keeper
And when I find her I'mma know just how to treat her
But shorty here, I didn't need her, and she ain't need me
She just didn't really wanna see somebody like the God be free
So I told her that she still got a spot in my stable
Just as long as she's healthy, ready, willing and able
So she still comes through sometimes, and I still laugh
Y'all do the math, bubble bath
Nahmean?

[Outro: The Reverend William Burk]
Why ya want what you can't have?
Why they want what they can't have?
Do the math, it makes me laugh
Don't get it twisted
Girls always want what they can't have
Ya wanna kill me, man
Don't be mad at me, I just tell it how it is
Keep it real
It's all about the fun, I ain't lie
Ya only want what you can't have
Do the math</pre>
