[Intro: Raekwon]
Yeah! Fly shit man, word up man
It's that old motherfuckin laid back and.....
Leanin back on that good ol' Al Packer, in the back of the vehicle and shit
Countin up motherfuckin sixty eight thousand, two motherfuckin vests' on the floor
Got mad reefa in the ashtray, police put seventeen cars away
You already know man shit is realer

[Verse One: Raekwon]
Threw on the Harley leather sheepskin gloves my beretta
'Bout to hit the ghetto hard body bring the kettle
Niggas is drinkin and gamblin, all you see is hammers in my corner
Champion sweats, hoes in pajamas
7:50  new blue this is my lady
She stay playin suits mad cute two three eighties
And the cousin, a police who lives in the east
I knew him from the fifth grade he different that's a beast
A thug smugglin cop who live in the hood
Plus he rock alot of cart hard, brave hard and die hard 
The day I seen him, was the day they try to rob him 
They pulled out a flare gun they shot up his charger
Yo beef started simmerin at dice games in pubs
Niggas runnin up in alleyways gettin mugged
Niggas lucky, 'cause them other niggas butt
I sat back calm as fuck entered the conference

[Chorus: Big Bub]
Whatever whenever, just keep that thing up on you
Whatever whenever............
Whatever whenever, just keep that thing up on you
Whatever whenever............

[Verse Two: Raekwon]
Show 'em how we position all of the shit glisten
Stones flooded the smith and liquor I'm reminiscin
Fiends is still sniffin, sons is still in prison
My pen is still scriptin all of them ghetto viisons
They gave me the contract came where mom's was at
Left her audi '86 in the driveway and the mac
Felt like young Bond Tom Ford slacks some metal lenses 
Two polaroid pictures in front of his brother's benzes
His sisters was some hustlin dykes, bullyin niggas
Ridin around mollied up plus suspended license
Hit the stash box right there, hundred in cash 
Left her blue steel muzzle in the glove box yikes
4:40 that mornin it's foggy 
I'm under the Gotti Louis jumper jack and huntin hat cocky
Mad 'cause I ain't fucked that mornin 
I had a korean malaysian black sista with a thunder back ridin me
Made it to the balcony part
Tossed the rope around the big lion head statue climbed up remarkably 
Right by the window they there
Took a glance through they covered in versace covers fuckin in the mirror
Couldn't see the face heard the moans
La Perla draws hung off the sectional chair, copped the chrome
Emptied the barrel, all you saw was goose down flyin
The trigger felt like wind was two bitches lyin there

[Chorus: Big Bub]
Whatever whenever, just keep that thing up on you
Whatever whenever............
Whatever whenever, just keep that thing up on you
Whatever whenever............

[Outro: Raekwon]
Show 'em how we position all of the shit glisten
Stones flooded the smith and liquor I'm reminiscin
Fiends is still sniffin, sons is still in prison
My pen is still scriptin all of them ghetto viisons</pre>
