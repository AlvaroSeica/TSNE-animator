[Verse 1]
Crush a bit, lil bit, roll it up, take a hit
Feeling lit, feeling right, 2AM, summer night
I don't care, hand on the wheel, driving drunk I'm doing my thing
Rolling the Midwest side and out, living my life, getting out dreams
People told me slow my roll, I'm screaming out, "Fuck that"
I'm a do just what I want, looking ahead no turning back
If I fall, if I die, know I lived it to the fullest
If I fall, if I die, know I lived and missed some bullets

[Chorus] 2x
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know
everything that shines ain't always gonna be gold
I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good

[Verse 2]
Tell me what you know about dreaming, dreaming
You don't really know about nothing, nothing
Tell me what you know about them night terrors, every night
5AM cold sweats waking up to the sky
Tell me what you know about dreams, dreams
Tell me what you know about night terrors, nothing
You don't really care about the trials of tomorrow
Rather lay awake in a bed full of sorrow

[Chorus] 2x
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know
everything that shines ain't always gonna be gold
I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good

[Bridge]
I'm on the pursuit of happiness
I know everything that shining ain't always gold
I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good

[Chorus] 2x
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know
everything that shines ain't always gonna be gold
I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good</pre>
