(*talking*)
Yeah, know I'm tal'n bout
It's your nigga, Dougie mayn
Shit, I know y'all boys been waiting for a long
Lil' skeet taste, and I'ma put it in your ear
Shit, I wreck for the Maab baby
S-L-A-B going hard baby, Slow Loud And Bangin'
In your motherfucking ear bitch, it's the Dougie

[Hook - 2x]
One, it's me the Dougie
Two, give it to you the way that it's 'spose to be
Three, y'all been waiting for Dougie for long time
Four, here we go and I'm putting it on your mind

[Dougie D]
Hold up, this your boy Dougie Deezie
Representing the Maab, and the S-L-A-Beezie
I'm off the heezie, please believe me for sheezie
I can rock a party and the mic, when I'm pleasing
Boys knocking, getting mad wanna stop me
Try to copy, but they game too sloppy
I stay wrecking, A Guerilla Maab veteran
Down in the Dirty, Southside Houston Texas
I'm still riding, cocked up 4's gliding
Throwed in the mix, Dougie D stay shining
All on it, kicking like a wild donkey
Heard the track, shitted on a bitch and got funky
It's your partna, cutting corners on choppers
Deuce out the roof, with a jazzy lil' mama
Already, so you know I stay wired
It's in our life mine too, it's going down

[Hook - 2x]

[Dougie D]
Bring it back, part two and don't quit
How you thinking it's over, and I ain't said shit
I'm a big body flipper, candy paint up on toys
Sliding down the Boulevard, wrecking on 4's
Trunk steady knocking, won't stop making noise
Dougie in your ear, bitch wrecking going hard
You can catch me sipping, on the purple potent fo'
With my big bro Z-Ro, and blowing on dro
Riding down my cousin Trae, screens lit up on gray
Jay'Ton, Lil B and the Pimp Skinn-ay
Frank Nitty in the cut, Raw D he throwed off
D-Bo got quitters, that'll slide your ass off

[Hook - 2x]

[Dougie D]
What it do like DJ Screw, I stay screwed up
Like my partna H.A.W.K., all tracks get chewed up
Hoes love me, wanna kiss touch and rub me
Told you once befo', bitch I'm all about my money
I'm never sober, fucked off and fucked over
Rocking on stage, with my towel on my shoulder
Hoes acting, all crazy straight snatching
Pulling on my throwback, bitch quit grabbing
I know you love it, like the way that Dougie does it
Always keep a couple of cakes, in the oven
Can I rip it, hell yeah I get wicked
Dougie on the grind, trying to get a mill ticket
Whoa whodi, slow it down you don't know me
Back back bitch, cause you pulling me too closely
Too forward, and you already know
They're my motherfucking niggaz, chunk it up there they go
