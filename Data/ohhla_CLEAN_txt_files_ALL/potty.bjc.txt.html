Gotta potty
Gotta potty
Potty
Potty!


You know what I said a
Gotta potty, I had to farty
Rappin' on the mic, uh-oh, there goes my body
I'm just a man with lots of class
And when I eat a lot of beans I have to pass gas
Ooh, there, it growled like a bear
I think it's time to check my dirty underwear
Tick tock a you don't stop
To the tick tick a you don't quit
I farted again, it sounded like thunder
Went to the bathroom they said take a number
From start to stall had to potty y'all
Refried beans gave my booty a call
37, yes, that's my number
6 minutes, 6 minutes, 6 minutes Bobby Jimmy you're on
o o on, o o on, o, o, o, o on

Oh! Oh! Oh my God!  (I gotta go!)
Oh! Oh! Oh my God!  (I gotta go!)
Oh! Oh! Oh my God!  (I gotta go!)
Oh! Oh! Oh my God!  (I gotta go!)
Uh let it go.  (Let it go)  Come on.  (Come on)
Uh let it go.  (Let it go)  Come on.  (Come on)

Yo brothers, what, I was late for the show
Why?  There wasn't any toilet paper on the roll
Oh no!  You forgot it again
I forgot, I forgot
I forgot the toilet paper on the roll
r r roll, r r roll
roll, roll roll r roll
no, no, no no no no I didn't
no, no no no no no no no no I didn't
no I didn't, don't get me wrong
I was stranded, I was stranded
I was stranded on the toilet bowl
B b bowl, b b bowl
Bowl, bowl, bowl, b bowl

(sung)Stranded, stranded on the toilet bowl
What do you do when you're stranded, no paper on the roll
To prove you're a man you must wipe with your hand
Then everyone will know you were stranded  (cry)

You know what I did next?  I grabbed the guy that was in the stall before me. 
And I looked him in the eye and I said:

(sung) It's all because of you
Got poopoo on my shoe
I must confess I used my shirt to clean up this mess
Oh don't you see
I got poop on my body
You took my paper away from me (cry)

Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Oh my God!

Will somebody tell me where the bathroom is?

There's a potty over there
There's a potty over here
There's a potty over there
A potty over there
There' s a potty everywhere
I need to find the bathroom!

Say potty!  (Potty!)
Say potty!  (Potty!)
Say potty!  (Potty!)
Say potty!  (Potty!)

Excuse me brother.  You got a quarter for the stall?</pre>
