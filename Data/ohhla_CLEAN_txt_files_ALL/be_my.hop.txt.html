Song:   Be My Friend
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I never had a lot of hope
I looked above and god had spoke
And said I'm only here because my daddys fuckin condom broke
Did I ever go to college (nope)
And even got no job for dough
I'm looked upon like I'm a joke
Cuz this the shit that I promote
The ill mind of hopsin!
Where real life's an option!
The ill lines that I spit make you realize your not sick!
Science at its finest tell Bill nye to watch it
I turn this shit the fuck up til your feeling high and nausious!
You fake thug rappers be frontin like you was born with Glocks
But only time you ever bang is when the door is locked
Nigger with attitude just without the s curl
I brake rappers like prmises with my ex girl
I'm kinda strange
And I been this way since a young age
The biggest book I've read was less than one page
Ive always had slump grades
Never use a condom like I want aids
A nutcase
I'll smash your fuckin dreams like a pugs face

[Chorus]
I'mma high school drop out
Still living at my moms house (my moms house) (OH YEAH!)
I talk shit and get knocked out
My life sucks and I'm not proud
Ohwow wow Do you wanna be my friend
I would love to be your friend
Come one man now
Do you wanna be my friend
I would love to be your friend
Come on man now

My life's lame
I gotta PAY money to fuck a whore, I couldn't pull a damn anorexic bitch in a tug of war

I'm sick of big headed niggas feelin above the lord
Somebody please give soldier boy the you suck award!
Out of all the styles you just had to pick the wak shit
Hopsin won't attack you if you practice
You faggot little bastard
I never would have imagined this would happen
I should fuckin power drive your ass into a cactus
Yo, the games mine, go rule you own
I got a foolish zone
I'm a pschitzo who carpools alone
Relax this is the music that I make for maniacs
Who can't adapt with the rest, now watch the chain react
The worlds cold, open your mouth and let me come inside
I diss the fuck outta rappers its cuz I wanna die
I never face my problems
Shit I always run from mine
I fucked my life up, now I'm tryin to give your son a try

[Chorus]
I'mma high school drop out
Still living at my moms house (my moms house) (OH YEAH!)
I talk shit and get knocked out
My life sucks and I'm not proud
Ohwow wow Do you wanna be my friend
I would love to be your friend
Come one man now
Do you wanna be my friend
I would love to be your friend
Come on man now

Yo, I come from a land where the kids fail
It's a sick hell
So if your frightened by my lyrics and looks bitch yell
Brainwashed, by slim shady and d12
Crooked, ludacriss, missy ellliot, big L
Well, yall no hopsin, but let me explain who marcus is
I make insiration on music for the retarted kids
Who suffer from parkinsons
Who's bodies set partsmason
Cuz in special man you really don't know how hard it is
You know I've always been a know it all
I thought that when I'd grow up tall
Id get pussy and not be using blow up dolls
I want more hoes
I can't control my hormones
I'm always watchin pornos in the bedroom with my door closed
Woah! Hey Hopsin!
Stop with the mental dagger games
You've already brainwashed our son, Alexander James
Hes only half your age
And now he masturbates
His whole perspective on the things that really matter changed man

[Chorus]
I'mma high school drop out
Still living at my moms house (my moms house) (OH YEAH!)
I talk shit and get knocked out
My life sucks and I'm not proud
Ohwow wow Do you wanna be my friend
I would love to be your friend
Come one man now
Do you wanna be my friend
I would love to be your friend
Come on man now</pre>
