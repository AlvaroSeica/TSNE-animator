[Talking]
Ease ya mind alittle bit (ease ya mind)
light up that blunt (light up that motherfuckin blunt)
let back that sun roof (lets get it started)

[Verse 1 - Boosie]
This that shit that we ride to
this that shit that we vibe to
this that shit that we get high to
that gangsta music nigga
and you can try but you ain't Lil' Boosie nigga (noooo - noooo)
bad bitches got you feelin great
looked at my CEO, like CEO let's get this cake
baby I hit the stage, and hoes go crazy - I'm playa made
all my hoes got Jordan skills they fade away
I hit the mall and ball (shit) throwback after throwback
everybody wanna take pictures they like damn you Mr.Kodak (call me Kodak)
smoke comin'out my sunroof a nigga shinin
nigga love gettin pussy, love rockin diamonds
if you got kids in this world nigga handle your business
and you don't need no nigga be independant
it's murder, murder niggaz beefin - niggaz slangin iron
I keep that purple purp to ease my mind tonight

[Chorus - Boosie]
Smokin on purple ease my mind (this that shit that we get high to - yeah)
it's murder, murder, murder gotta keep ya nine (this that shit that we ride to - yeah)
Smokin on purple ease my mind (this that shit that we get high to - yeah)
it's murder, murder, murder gotta keep ya nine (this that shit that we ride to - yeah)

[Verse 2 - Boosie]
I know the game, I know the street
I got the rap, you got the beats
and we gon'lay it down real sweet
so ya'll can ride, head bobbin side to side
I don't want shit from my fans but this feel the real nigga vibe
when you down and out don't nobody trust ya
but when you got bread, it seem like everybody love ya
it's still fucked up mayne in certain cases (believe this look)
look they still racist, I see it on them bitches faces
that's why I'm smokin and laughin I got my grind on
they don't feel my struggle they think my mind gone
that's why it's murder, murder - kill, kill on the corner
these lil'niggaz got big pistols ready to put it on ya
so when you die, you might as well be high
is it Heaven or Hell?....or is it all lies?
that's why I smoke purple on Monday - purple on Tuesday
two blocks, cops so they don't blues me (hah)

[Chorus - Boosie]
Smokin on purple ease my mind (this that shit that we get high to - yeah)
it's murder, murder, murder gotta keep ya nine (this that shit that we ride to - yeah)
Smokin on purple ease my mind (this that shit that we get high to - yeah)
it's murder, murder, murder gotta keep ya nine (this that shit that we ride to - yeah)

[Verse 3 - Webbie]
Smokin on this doja, I done got a bag for cheap
nigga eyes barely open and I'm glued to the backseat
Boosie took another hit and then he passed it back to me
this shit must got somethin in it, nigga slipped some crack on me
ain't no crack up in the windows I can barely even breathe
got me fumblin and trippin I almost passed the blunt to C
got it cloudy in the Bently nigga squintin tryna see
they don't know what time it is, but I know it's time to eat
ridin dirty while we ridin dirty you know how that shit be
one day you here then the next day you gone on repeat
with that nine up in my reach, 'cause right now dyin ain't for me
mayne this pine got me sleepy but I'm too high to go to sleep
bust it open, when you roll it potent as it 'ppose to be
and we rollin I'm smokin them back to back constantly
Keep Movin, Dutches, Phillies, Garcils, to Swisher Sweets
Young Savage don't really care - ust put that shit up in the air......

[Chorus - Boosie]
Smokin on purple ease my mind (this that shit that we get high to - yeah)
it's murder, murder, murder gotta keep ya nine (this that shit that we ride to - yeah)
Smokin on purple ease my mind (this that shit that we get high to - yeah)
it's murder, murder, murder gotta keep ya nine (this that shit that we ride to - yeah)</pre>
