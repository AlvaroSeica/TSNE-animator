Typed by: AZ Lyrics

You should have know it from the jump she a jump
Every time a nigga pop a bottle she a jump
You should see a face when you see a nigga stunt
She be looking at his car like, "this the one I want!"
And she know, you can't afford that shit
She a bad baby bitch, you should have bought that bitch!
Me and my niggas world tour that bitch
No Benzes, we Honda-Accord that bitch!
So you look real dumb, you know that!
You know your income, she gonna blow that!
Where your hoe at? Where your hoe at?
Looking like the front page of world star in my Kodak.
But it's not your fault, nobody schooled you
You was new in town, the bitch fooled you!
How you fucked up of you let her
But you know now, so do better!

Holler at me, I can tell you, what is hidden, foe
Everybody in the club got her info
She a freak, she a whop, she a nimpho
So make sure you don't get sentimental!

Yeah, you love her
But she loves everyone, everyone, everyone
That's everybody's girl
And each time that you lay down and touch her
Just know you ain't the only one! Oh no that's not cha girl
That's everybody's girl!

Michelle and Chante!
Down to a make one hell of an entre
One of them is married the other one gone straight
So how you gonna treat them hoes like prom dates?
Imposing your face, they pose with bump face
All these names dropping
Like, "you know we know Lebron James?"
I'm like so bitch? Who else you know, bitch?
With âem all old bags, is them coaches?
Taking pics in another nigga Phantom
Out in Vegas with a couple other randoms
Molly Heads got a pill popping anthem
And them real bad bitches can't stand them!
Can you blame them? You can't tame them!
You with strangers? I wouldn't even change them!
I'm just happy that I told my crew
Cause we all need hoes like you!

Holler at me, I can tell you, what is hidden, foe
Everybody in the club gofuvkjhhbm
She a freak, she a whop, she a nimpho
So make sure you don't get sentimental!

Yeah, you love her
But she loves everyone, everyone, everyone
That's everybody's girl
And each time that you lay down and touch her
Just know you ain't the only one!oh no that's not cha girl.
That's everybody's girl!
Turn the lights on!

How you're in a lab with a jump showing off a Benz
Not even knowing you can...
I'll be courtside at the lake show
And I bet she know who all the niggas is!
Saying that's her bro or her bestie
Bitch prolly' fucked half for the SPs.
And I bet she got two phones
You'll be like, "do you smile like that when you text me?"
Head super cold, unemployed
But always be a allstar, week in the super-bowl
Super hoe, she living large
Staying underneath was clothes, always in a different car.
I can never be mad at her grind
Do your thing, love! The head shine
But if you kill a nigga over her
Shit, I hope you do a whole lot of time!

Holler at me, I can tell you, what is hidden, foe
Everybody in the club got her info
She a freak, she a whop, she a nimpho
So make sure you don't get sentimental!

Yeah, you love her
But she loves everyone, everyone, everyone
That's everybody's girl
And each time that you lay down and touch her
Just know you ain't the only one!
That's everybody's girl!
Turn the lights on!</pre>
