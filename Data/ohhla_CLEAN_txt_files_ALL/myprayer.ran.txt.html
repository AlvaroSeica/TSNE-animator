[Intro: Random]
I think I'd be remiss in the middle of this holiday season
if I didn't, try to at least shed a little bit of light on
those who have not, SO
This goes out to everybody
who may not feel that you got the best Christmas coming
Realize, it could be a lot worse

[Random]
Soon as we finish off the turkey and the cranberry
sauce, I'm off in the basement with Aunt Mary
Breaking out the box labeled Xmas
A seven foot tree completes the checklist
Tree up, stocking stuffed, now we ready
The warmth of the season always gets my heart heavy
Kinda feel emotional at this time of year
I know the holidays are 'sposed to bring all kinda cheer
But I wonder how the homeless is gettin through 'em
without presents or family to give 'em to 'em
And the orphans, who watch us spend fortunes
on stuff we can't afford when they only get a portion
That's why I try to show some love
Donate some time, sweaters, coats and gloves, you know?
Growin up, we ain't have a lot of dough
Borderline poor, but don't tell that to my momma though
Single mother, cause was pop was never there
But she saved all year so the tree was never bare
And I'm proud of her, know that I'm lucky G
Pray to be half of the parent that she was to me
Taught me some valuable lessons
Like if you're blessed, it's only right to be a blessing
And I'ma always remember
The season of giving doesn't start in December

[Chorus]
This is my Christmas Prayer
I hope it sees you in good health or gets you there, yeah
Sometimes we forget you there
But the blessing is that we have gifts to share
I say again - this is my Christmas Prayer
I hope it sees you in good health or gets you there, yeah
Sometimes we forget you there
But the blessing is we always have gifts to share

[Random]
To the students that I taught in Langhorne at Woods Services
who never had the option of good alternatives
Products of poor parenting and mad abuse
And yet they wonder why you feel like you don't deserve to live
How serious is it?
Some kids there go years without a parental visit
But they send you mad expensive presents
And you would trade it all just to be within their presence
Some of 'em, never goin home again
I pray you never spend a holiday alone again
Gets me in a reflective mood
How would you live if you had no one you were special to?
Some see it as a decoration and some and lights
But I see it as a symbol, on how to live your life
Oh why make a child if you can't take care of it?
And what good is fortune, if you ain't sharin it?
The best gift is easy to see
It isn't in a box sittin under a tre
It's good in the winter, and all year through
The greatest gift I have, is you~!
The best gift is easy to see
It isn't in a box sittin under a tree
It's good in the winter, and all year through
The greatest gift I have is you, f'real

[Chorus]</pre>
