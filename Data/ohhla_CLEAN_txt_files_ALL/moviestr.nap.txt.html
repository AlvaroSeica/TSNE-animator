[Napoleon]
Roll out the red carpet for the new king
Off of two stings, I got Red Monkeys on the blue jeans
Now I got hit the whole Zoo theme
Chinchillas, with panda bear minks, you know the routine
Life being me is like a true dream
Look at the news screen, my team too hot, how can we lose steam
I'm going to the jewels, when I choose bling
And come back, with a mouth full of rugers the way I do things
Sorta like they close in the screw scene
If the gangsta act tight with his dope, I'll let the ooze bring
Fifty cent short, I refuse fiends
Long as my shoes clean, the talent's on me like a Tom Cruise fling
I'm still in the hood cuz I move cream
I was a routine, stash crack, in my inner two seems
Ten years later, still the Q's clean
I roll with convicts, that would of played on Paul Crew's team

[Chorus: Napoleon]
Even though they knew me, damn near, my whole life
Niggas treat me like a movie star
The models wouldn't date me, now they loving the don
Cuz they treat me like a movie star
The feds take our pictures, when we leaving the club
Cuz they treat us like a movie star
Champagne, caviar, groupies and czars
I live the life of a movie star

[Napoleon]
Ya'll broke dudes funny like Money Mike, we got our money right
From robbing dice games in gin rummy heist
Thirty two hundred was a dummy price
We flying first class, while ya'll in coach, having a bum flight
Bang, we don't 'Cher' like Sonny's wife
Next frame, catch me up in the beam, that's Easter Bunny white
Got the game sown like a mummy twice
My shit banging, like barbeque chicken with the honey spice
Now my ex wish she would of done me right
Cuz my new chick's hair long, breast big and tummy tight
It must be heaven cuz it's sunny nights
I'm fucking easy, while most of ya'll live the Ted Bundy life
Them diamonds ain't real you got lumpy ice
Stones fades, glass clouded looking like a junky pipe
When it come to pies, I want a chunky slice
I'm living fabulous, eating good, cause about a honkey wife

[Chorus]</pre>
