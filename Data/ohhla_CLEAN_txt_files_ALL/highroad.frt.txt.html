[Verse 1 - Mike Shinoda]
Let's go ya'll

These people are running off at the mouth
Tryin to convince me that I'm running on empty
Tryin to convince themselves that the record
With Jay was a fluke
That the record that I'm makin is a mistake
And I can't take this
Let me tell you where I'm at with this
You bastards are gonna have to take back that shit
I'm not plastic and fake
When I make tracks I take facts and lay them out for the masses
You assholes are gonna see soon that I'm not playin'
Start askin me the names that I'm not sayin'
But I'm tryin to be bigger than the bickerin'
Bigger than the petty name callin'
Under the breath talkin
Rumors and labels and categorization
I'm like a struggling doctor
No patients
But you can say what you want about me
Keep talkin' while I'm walkin away

[Hook - John Legend]
You can say what you have to say
Cause my mind's made up anyway
I'm taking the high road going above you
This is the last time that I'm gonna trust you

You can say what you have to say
Cause my mind's made up anyway
All that bullshit you talk might work a lot
But it's not gonna work today

[Verse 2 - Mike Shinoda]
You people are running off at the mouth
Tryin to make me take myself off safety
Tryin to make my friends turn their backs on the team we built
Buildin' up some mistaken information
And I can't take this
Let me spell it out plain for you
Angry groups complain about the things we do
I'm not changing direction, I'm stepping my game up
Maintainin my name, the same way I came up
You're gonna see that I'm not playin'
Start asking the names that I'm not sayin'
But I'm tryin not to mention the names of people
Who wanna sight and attention
You like the hype but pretendin you're part of the picture won't pass
You're like a high school dropout
No class
You can say what you want about me
Keep talkin' while I'm walkin away
Bitch

[Hook]

[Bridge - John Legend]
Why does it always have to be
Somebody's always watching me
All I really need is some room to breathe (breathe, breathe)

Is anybody out there listening?
Cause I can't stand to keep this in
All I really want, I'll say it again (yeah, yeah)
(Like that)
