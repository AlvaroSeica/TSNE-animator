Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Hook 8X]
If you ain't from my hood, you could get from 'round here

[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
Terror town, no limit gang, MB, we let pistols ring
Lil Bibby, I dare a nigga try to jump silly, lot of new niggas trying to
Fuck with me, I don't fuck with guys that ain't 150, and the opps scared
To come near me, cause you know a nigga keep the pump with me; I be posted up with my
Crew nigga, trigger happy, we shoot niggas - move around, who is you, nigga?
Who is you, nigga?
My little niggas do take downs with the trey pound, put your face down
If he don't get down, make him lay down - if he try to run, get chased down
Let him hear how the eight sound, now they got yellow tape 'round
They was sleep, but they awake now, and my hood don't play around

[Hook 8X]
If you ain't from my hood, you could get from 'round here

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
If you ain't from the Eight Block, better move around, ain't no walking on the
Set bitch, cause we reckless, we'll shoot him down - work a nigga like he
Losing pounds, Vito City, our name ranging, throwing signs we
Gang banging, Black Mob ain't no shit, don't tell shooter
We name-changing, that's on the guys, run up on him with the black Mag
In the black mask, leave him on his ass, we whacking shit, and that's no surprise
If you lowkey, better hope it last, cause we on that, and I don't think y'all
Want that, leave a nigga stinking on Colfax, speeding in the Lincoln
No throwback, now I'm back up on the Essex block, .30 poppers with a
Extra Glock, my niggas got 47 sweating hot, so you better run when that beretta cocked

[Hook 9X]
If you ain't from my hood, you could get from 'round here</pre>
