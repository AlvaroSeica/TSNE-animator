Song:   Welcome to Arizona
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Welcome to Arizona (oh yeah)
Throw your A's to the sky
I know you wanna ride
Magic City Arizona
Oh yeaaahhh
Throw your A's to the sky
I know you wanna ride
Magic City Arizona

Magic City Arizona where the sun is king
Everyday we still fighting for that championship ring
Even through the recession
we all want success
DJ's in nightclubs and hot girls undress
For the money, the fame, to break into the game
Two shots of patron and she'll give you anything
Even though sheriff Joe is satan in the flesh
My people still make it past the walls and the fence
Im living proof of this American dream
selling ring tones and always raising up AZ
From the lies, to sexy lady pretty brown eyes
Feels good to hear em say AZilla overtime
When I land in the bay, or the 915
When I'm on stage at the gibson in my cocaine white
Nick dolls, BIg D, NastyBoy is in the building
And we bout to make a killin'

Welcome to Arizona (oh yeah)
Throw your A's to the sky
I know you wanna ride
Magic City Arizona
Oh yeaaahhh
Throw your A's to the sky
I know you wanna ride
Magic City Arizona

Listen, its AZ not the birth place of X3
But the place that made me who you know me to be
I've been rocking radio since dos mil cero dos
And aint no other dude that crack the microphone
Dun come close, to the list
Of many accomplishments,
I've got so many accolades it doesn't seem to make sense
And all because, of all of Arizona showing love
So how can I not represent the state that rise me up above
I started rapping, right here in AZ
I started making it happen, right here in AZ
I kept the clubs packing, right here in AZ
And even into the higher tax bracket, right here in AZ
So I say, peace to everyone in the valley of the sun
Whether you dabble in the books or whether you gamble with the gun
you've embraced, and for that you can never be replaced
So throw your city in the sky and MAY IT RECIPROCATE with age

Welcome to Arizona (oh yeah)
Throw your A's to the sky
I know you wanna ride
Magic City Arizona
Oh yeaaahhh
Throw your A's to the sky
I know you wanna ride
Magic City Arizona

Yeah, one of the originals, I represent man im from Arizona
Get love and respect from my city every time I roll up
Born and raised on the east side of phoenix in Maricopa
Known for spitting that heat got plenty up in my holster
I'm a soldier, straight hustler wont catch me on the sofa
Playing Nintendo, man I get my dough in Arizona
Outta towners get crushed thinking that they can roll up on us
But never that, try to disrespect us, that'll get you toe up
Shout out to MC Magic and the homie X3
We stay relevant while you other fools remain sleepy
To the homes from the west side, avenues, AZ
South side representing and keeping it gangsta like weezie
I been rapping since the bookie free style in the mid 90?s
Other days when it was more life and the city was behind us
I stay connected to my city like george and weezie
If you visiting my stateÂ….

Welcome to Arizona (oh yeah)
Throw your A's to the sky
I know you wanna ride
Magic City Arizona
Oh yeaaahhh
Throw your A's to the sky
I know you wanna ride
Magic City Arizona </pre>
