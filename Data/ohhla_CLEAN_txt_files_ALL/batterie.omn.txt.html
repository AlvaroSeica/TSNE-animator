batterie batterie batterie

jack of all trades in a black and white valentino
wanted out in reno for portraying dealers in casinos
jetted down the coast switch coats hit a new circuit new jack
pen a perfect got the waitress working no cap __
we got em over worked with no tax carry the big bag
from the streets and the zig zags relax feel the impact
tell the cop to cooperate they cant raise the poker face
I give it to them straight heads up aces wild cant fade the style
they bid hit em unexpected damn they look sketchy
gotta bouncer in the front heavy trying to keep it steady
when I open up the door they werent ready when they meet me

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
put em in the air keep em there
batterie
put em in the air keep them there
batterie
put em in the air

I bomb my synodium __ read Napoleon
I strip the door I got the doodie in
__ rock hard
break shit on the late shift looking sold against
earthquake lift til it level out
tech lab on the beat please take the treble out
I'm ready now bout to be so I can bring battaries
brain manilies so I can make a hard rock out of me
we got what you came for no further adeui
anticapated waded threw a water or two
push push heavy cargo todays tommorrow
my crew moves in car loads see
those that wanna be let me show you something about skill
if you wanna beef I out the meat on the grill its black angus
for real kill I'm still stainless the unsual __</pre>
