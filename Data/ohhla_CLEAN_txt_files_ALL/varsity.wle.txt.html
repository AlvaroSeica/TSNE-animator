Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Ah, you say that you love me
Know that couldn't be real
My highschool girlfriend dykin', my side bitch and take her pill
And all these bitches that I hung with ain't doing too well
And every nigga that I hung with just use me for bail
Once considered a rouge, I was chilling alone
But I did have miss medusa, she loud and she leave me stoned
Used to ride little buses, I ain't fuck with my teachers
They ain't fuck with me neither
15 and high on reefer
Thank God for what I did with blocking against this shaky defense
Yeah they always defend you, look how they say your name
But if you're rap shit attendant I bet them feelings change
Look, just remember how that winning taste
Just in case a nigga never see that thrill again
Love the game know this is coming from a different place
Different stage, you switching paces like them...
Look, just remember how that winning taste
Just in case a nigga never see that thrill again
Love the game know this is coming from a different place
All the... all in the world...

Varsity Blues y'all, Varsity Blues
Varsity Blues y'all, Varsity Blues
Varsity Blues y'all, Varsity Blues
Varsity Blues y'all, Varsity Blues

Look, I'm talking Reggie Bush, matter of fact ask Cameron Newton
Matter of fact go ask they schools how many jerseys they was moving
Thank you for they tuition, thank you for room and board
Most of the niggaz got no pot to piss during fall
Niggaz thinking in moving, AJ flipping computers
Brandon Davis had relations, what if Jimmer was screwing?
They hate on Calipari, but I never seen the problem
They get one season and poppin shit, at least he's being honest
They always in their class, they always at their practice
While they bumming for cash, you made it grip off a bracket
Shout out to mid-majors, who forget what they major
Just trying to go somewhere play somewhere with your players
Pardon me, European, fuck who your current team is
Cause every QB with my features is a Willie Beamen
We never gonna be shit, unless we believe we need shit
... to your leadership critiquing me some from the bleachers

Varsity Blues y'all, Varsity Blues
Varsity Blues y'all, Varsity Blues
Varsity Blues y'all, Varsity Blues
Varsity Blues y'all, Varsity Blues

Look, just remember how that winning taste
Just in case a nigga never see that thrill again
Love the game know this is coming from a different place</pre>
