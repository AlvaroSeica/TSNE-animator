[Intro - Timbaland]
Oh! Come here shorty, I like you
What? You like me too?
I don't understand what you're saying but let me talk to you...

[Hook - Timbaland] &amp; (Raje Swari)
I got my eyes on you (mera raja)
Baby let me tell you that are the truth (tu hai me raja)
I love your Indian flute (mera raja)
Oh da da do da da do da do
Sing it to me! (Tu phil a mera milen antha)
Sing it to me! (Tu phil a mera pyar hua)
Sing it to me! (Darasa tu mein loo to kya )
But I can't understand a word you're sayin...

[Verse 1]
[Raj] Bari mujhe phil a hai ab bach na
[Tim] Baby, I've been eyein' you way from afar
[Raj] Teri ake'o mein kuch de ta
[Tim] Thanks for the props but to me, you the star
[Raj] Nadin a kuw bol lun aaja
[Tim] Let's get it on tonight, why wait for tomorrow?
[Raj] Come on, can you show me how bad you are?
[Tim] Aaja soniye mein pya kya, oh!

[Hook - Timbaland] (Raje Swari)
I got my eyes on you (mera raja)
Baby let me tell you that are the truth (tu hai me raja)
I love your Indian flute (mera raja)
Oh da da do da da do da do
Sing it to me! (Tu phil a mera milen antha)
Sing it to me! (Tu phil a mera pyar hua)
Sing it to me! (Darasa tu mein loo to kya )
But I can't understand a word you're sayin...

[Verse 2]
[Raj] Abito batana mein kya karoo
[Mag] Baby you sure you wanna sleep next to 'Oo
When it's 3, all that's on the TV is Kung Fu
Fuck around and a nigga end up on top of you
[Raj] Dooga hai ta zindagi hai tu
[Mag] You weren't the first, best believe fo' sho' there's been a few
[Raj] Come on bang the music 'cause I'm feelin' you
[Mag] Aaja soniye par kurta voo

[Verse 3]
[Raj] Tere baho mein ab pluleo
[Sab] Go slow and I'll direct your every move
Like a young Benny Boom after beatin' up your womb
No need to put on perfume, baby girl you leavin' soon
[Raj] Kabhi mere paso jele aaja
[Sab] Nobody gotta know your thong was maroon
[Raj] Tere huna
[Sab] You know, after creepin' out my room
[Raj] Tu hi mera
[Sab] Just so your man don't assume
[Tim] Sing it to him!
[Raj] Kasise humara meruna
[Tim] Sing it to him!
[Raj] Dumhese hum dono dewana
[Tim] Sing it to him!
[Raj] Hum heeto hum muste me koya
Para to me loo to kya hua
