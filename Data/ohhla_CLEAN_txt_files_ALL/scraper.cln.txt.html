[MessCalen]
Give me a bag of that glue shit, nigga I'm good
In a Scraper eatin Now or Laters, nigga I'm hood
You spend a whole fifty, I give ya a solid
Like that Remi in my cup, I'm a alcoholic
The first, the second, and the third dumb off
Them four-five's and the Eagle birds jump off
It's summertime everybody on the corner sellin crack
Finna get my money, nigga fuck all that
The Buick need paint, it's The Up All Nite Show
Four in the mornin nigga snortin that nitro
In my Scraper makin paper, parks still smokin
I need a bottle and the sto' ain't open, shit

[Hook: Keak Da Sneak] - 2X
I'm in a Scraper makin paper, drinkin Remi ????
Yadadadamean, ain't from the Golden State
But shit, can't hate-can't hate, catch me with some real boss niggaz
Some more rawer than Digga, slang rock everywhere like Jigga

[MessCalen]
I got a sell for a hundred, and I'm on my way
It's been slow as fuck around this bitch all day
Fuck it, I'm about to go and pull a jack
And jump out on the corner, with a mask and a Mac
And jump back in the car with another nigga sack
And a couple mo' days come right fuckin back
Yeah, yo boy gotta count
I hit Times and snatch the bill out a nigga mouth
You know, it's one of them days
I can get you chalupa, in so many ways
In my Scraper makin paper, ridin and still smokin
I need a bottle but the sto' ain't open, shit

[Hook: Keak Da Sneak] - 2X

(*Talking*)
Ah, we runnin this here
Ay, keep goin my nigga, hit this left
Yeah, ah, hey, park right here
Ay, ay, ay, yeah, ay, we just ran the bitch over
