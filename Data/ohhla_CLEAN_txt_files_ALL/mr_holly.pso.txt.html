Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro]
Chillin on the street in my b-boy stance
I got my pockets on swoll and my beats on blast

[Chorus]
I'm Mr. Hollywood, Mist-Mr. Hollywood
And everywhere that I go, yup, it's probably hood
I'm Mr. Hollywood, Mist-Mr. Hollywood
And everything that I say, yeah, it's probably good
I'm Mr. Hollywood, Mist-Mr. Hollywood
And would I give it to shorty? Yeah, I probably would
"Chillin on the street in my b-boy stance
 I got my pockets on swoll and my beats on blast"

[Verse One]
I'm Mr. Hollywood, Mist-Mr. Hollywood
I'm puffin la-di-da-di and party in Hollyhood
I'm probably out with a hottie shakin her body good
God she lookin like Halle Berry, rubbin my holly wood
She looked her best in the dress on her breasts
I gotta look fresh so I dress to impress
I got a greater mind every time I say a rhyme
Hollywood ain't spendin money, people it's a state of mind
I break a hater's spine, then I'd just be facin time
I'd rather just create a rhyme, sip and drink, date and dine
If I make her mine, maybe I can make her grind
on the beach, overseas, livin on Jamaican time
We sunbakin, gettin naked chillin wastin time
Sippin out a chalice gin and tonic with a chase of lime
Mami shake and wind, damn your face is fine
Mr. Hollywood, livin my life through space and time

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
Yo, yo
Let me tell you 'bout my campaign (uh-huh)
I'm a mellow type of nigga chillin, tryin to do my damn thang
If you hatin that's a damn shame
I'm untouchable, my body stays dry under damp rain
I'm just tryin to get this cash mayne
I take pulls real slow even though I'm in the fast lane
You got a gat but you got bad aim
My crew is risin to the top like the bubbles do in champagne
Party people get your groove on
Sip a drink, puff an L and start movin to this smooth song
You tryin to tussle with my crew? WRONG~!
Keep sleepin I'm about to cop the drop with the roof gone
Passin L's like Grey Poupon
I don't even need a telly I bank shorty on my futon
Wifebeater and my boots on
Yeah I'm lovin you tonight, but tomorrow we can move on

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
I come with the Yankee hung fitted
Fluid tongue run liquid movin dumb dumb critics
Son winnin, +I'm Not a Player+ like Pun, get it
Not bangin no gun clip in just makin some fun wit it
I'm livin Hollywood now without the fame
Just a lil' bit of money I'm about my game
I'm about my name, I'm about my strife
I'm about my struggle, I'm about my life
I'm just tryin to do this music thing whatever it takes
Cause we all know the value rap revenue makes
For y'all corny acts I gotta make it federal case
I'm the tortoise you the hare I got incredible pace
Had an incredible night, had incredible sex
She had on edible panties under her red and blue dress
YES~! And I move with the wind
So we can wake up in the mornin and just do it again

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Aight what I want everybody to do right now
Is just smooth it out
Yeah, smooth it out
{*piano plays and applause*}
Nah, we ain't done yet!
YEAH!! I'm feelin so good right now
I'm on top of my game
Shout out to all my people ballin on a budget
Broke as fuck
You can still live Hollywood y'know?
"Chillin on the street in my b-boy stance
 I got my pockets on swoll and my beats on blast"

[Chorus] - dub version to fade

"Chillin on the street in my b-boy stance
 I got my pockets on swoll and my beats on blast"</pre>
