[Beanie Sigel]
Bare witness to the greatest, can't beat us, join us
Keep heaters on us, wit red lasers
Now fair warning, sure shots wont graze ya
We hug corners, play blocks like Gators
With bundles on us, serve tre's like waiters
It's the life we chose to hustle
Can't stop it, can't knock it
Half the profit get flown out Vegas
Me and my niggaz try an' break tables
Stack chips like Connect Four
While you prick's try and whip try and stretch more
Charge less for, that ain't the program
Get ya lessons from the snow man
Like Pillsbury I get the doe man
I'll off ya head for a slice of bread
I keep my word and I'm true to my peeps
Give me a bird and my crew gon' eat
I'm over the stove like +Cuban Links+
Breakin' down +Cash Money+ like +Baby+ do
You niggaz soft like baby food
'Round the world niggaz pay me dues
While you niggaz sing the same old song like Sadies do
Grown man nigga, baby who?
I'll send you shots from the baby zoo
Old game like Grady fool
Propane flow flame you dudes
No name's don't claim ya shoes

Once again its on nigga, Sigel hard like corn liqour
I'll take you out this world like you was born nigga
Butt naked covered in blood, gaspin' for air
Clingin' for dear life, nigga you dead right

[Jay-Z]
Since you was a baby coward
We been sprinklin' the world with baby powder
+So Fresh and So Clean+
Been an outcast since I was a teen
But I outlast cuz I outblast anybody you bring
Young, you got it the prophet I told ya'll niggaz
Then I showed ya'll niggaz, you +Can't Knock It+
Don't get carried away, you a mute nigga (mute nigga)
Where was you nigga? I was doin' this here like Mary J.
Like +Every Day+, and was true nigga

[Beanie Sigel]
They can't question what we do Jigga.

[Jay-Z]
Once again it's on, Young run through you niggaz
Like a glitch in the computer nigga
I'm the shit, I'm a sewer nigga
This is Jay everyday, no days off, Ferris Bueler nigga

[Beanie Sigel]
B-Sig' Fred Kruger niggaz
Nightmare ??? nigga
You scared cuz I grew with Jigga
He said "Sig' you that nigga," couldn't see his vision
But then he drew the picture, like a compository sketch
Yeah Sig' stay honest I'll deposit you a check
There's a secret society, all we ask is trust
No G money shit all we gots is us
True indeed, yes, more better, yes
More cheddar, S.P. chain, jeans and sweaters
Movies, cartoons, labels, etcetera
Fill in the blanks and drop blocks like tetris or
Get off the block, run south with M. Betha
From my block to your block, shout out to M Extra
Who the fuck (fuck) want (want) what (what)
None of you niggaz is B-Sig' word I'm done with you niggaz

[Beanie Sigel]
Once again it's on, fuck it we ain't through wit niggaz
Twin towers here to ruin niggaz
You couldn't break up the towers with Tomjanovich
or Osama bombin' shit
We slay niggaz wit K's, we the drama men
Get it right young scrap don't even try it boy (boy)
You rather slide down the razor blade slidin' board
I'm a live wire, hoolahoop barb wire
Run through hell with gasoline draws on
You can't mute me put the pause on
My guns shoot like fast-foward's on
And dress cute when the war's off
What you doin' dawg, you playin' wit it
You make your bed right you layin' in it
You keep your ?share? tight you stayin' in it
You bringin' niggaz where your kids sleep
I sing to niggaz while the kids sleep
Rock-a-bye muthafucka.
I hope you high muthafucka.
Ready to die muthafucka.

Who shot ya? Seperate the weak from State Prop' the
Kids who squash beef and run them streets

[Jay-Z]
Once again it's on nigga, bring the drama to ya lawn nigga
Tell ya mama {?| get ready to mourn sista, it's a
See what you got here's a full blown twister
You nothin' but hot air, it's not fair
The reason why we lead the pack, this is a marathon
You start off fast then you weezin' in the back
So even if I slack, I got enough lee-way
To put out The Reason by the Mac, Philadelphia Freeway
And I'm back, without leavin' I'm here, but you can't see him
I gave you the Blueprint but you can't be him
So no matter what you been told or the records you sold
Deep inside you know that it's only one Hove
Young Vito, voice of the young people
If my life is a movie then Sigel be the sequel
We bring it to your door with Bleek peekin' through your peek hole
And don't get scared nigga, alert ya people

[Beanie Sigel]
Once again it's on</pre>
