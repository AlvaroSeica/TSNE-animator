[LongShot]
One two, one two
My name is LongShot
"Civil War, Pt. 2" the mixtape
My man Overflow is on the beat
Birthwrite Records, EV Productions
We 'bout to do it one time
What?

Hey yo take what I'm not supposed ta, not a jokesta
{Fuck} you and yo' comedy raps, blocks'll roach ya
And stop givin rocks, niggaz stop glock promotions
What happened to kids idolizin they Jordan poster?
Now they growin up wantin to be like poppa posted
Fightin a case from the box, life in a toaster
Hyper than most, sheer flowin offa energy
Fake niggaz turn they back and I ain't talkin enemies
I'm talkin, who wanna work to merch', I'm 'bout that bidness kid
Killin this "Civil War" shit with vicious penmanship
I want my membership, in the BBC
Puttin my niggaz on like 15 deep
Spit these mean while faggots still swearin they nice
Left in the car, at the show they scared of the mic
Scared to get hype, not me, I'm crunker than John
From the weed, I don't get drunk on the job, no more
Quote raw, s'why I forever live with a cold sore
You don't know what it's like livin your whole life in a cold war
Hold more, anger than a banger that pours
I'm Mos Def +The New Danger-ous+ flow so make way nigga
I'm down down on the ground ground already already
to get that fetti and (throw it up, I'm goin up)
I'm down down on the ground ground already already
to get that fetti and (throw it up, I'm goin up)
I'm down down on the ground ground already already
to get that fetti and (throw it up, I'm goin up)</pre>
