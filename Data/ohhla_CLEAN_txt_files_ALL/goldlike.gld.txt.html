Typed by: Matt Mortoni

I got gold chains, I got gold ropes
I got gold rims, I got gold spokes
You ain't never seen gold like this
You ain't never seen gold like this

[Make make make] them bitches roll

I got gold chains, I got gold ropes
I got gold rims, I got gold spokes
You ain't never seen gold like this
You ain't never seen gold like this
I got gold chains, I got gold ropes
I got gold rims, I got gold spokes
You ain't never seen gold like this
You ain't never seen gold like this

You ain't never seen gold like this
You ain't never seen gold like this
I got gold chains, I got gold ropes
I got gold rims, I got gold spokes
You ain't never seen gold like this
You ain't never seen gold like this

[Make make make] them bitches roll

I got gold chains, I got gold ropes
I got gold rims, I got gold spokes
You ain't never seen gold like this
You ain't never seen gold like this
I got gold chains, I got gold ropes
I got gold rims, I got gold spokes
You ain't never seen gold like this
You ain't never seen gold like this

You ain't never seen gold like this </pre>
