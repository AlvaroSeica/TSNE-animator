(Raekwon)
This veteran's charge, soon to have a whiley garage
Yea, demand the land, I want a jet black discovery recovery, big time
See when you, when you start fuking wit my shit like that
You're taking on a natural high see what I'm saying
Shit is natural (yea no doubt) shit is like baking a cake
Know what I mean, like squeezing a hand joint (word up design, designing)
Know what I'm saying, Doe or Die style kid, the remix

(Both)
Yo, yo I roll wit brothers who puff dust lust plus
A + conniving cash you can't trust
Yo, these avalanche rock throwers, granola holders
Style is steady ready like a military soldier
Wu Killa Bee plus Sosa, AZ
Two SC's, Doe or die style, let's see
Yo, the track's banging like an armaretta shake son
Take some, 50 on whatever we make son

(Raekwon)
Yo now let me show you how my whole team operate
Cooperate, tie you up, drop you on the Tri-state
What up, my whole style is camoflage
The veteran's charge, bagging all these shorties up in sport cars
When we react, it's like Mafia, keep jims rocking ya
Czechoslovakia, Khadafi the diamonds
What soulsa La costra da nostra
Snap a flick of this Chef, double exposure

(AZ)
Who's the wickedest, street officialist, Guess, Gortex
Lex is the crispiest, ice the vidiculous
Peep and look, the unexplainable'll keep ya shook
High illism, the realism got you hooked
So let's lay law cause only fat cats play raw
Let this ?a pour? 'cause taking his paper's all I claim for
The resurrection 86 cartel connection
Raid your section, el's twist to a perfection

(Raekwon)
Primetime, genuine, shine, Lex seat recline
Yo, Vine, he ran up on me wit a nine, he's mine
I won't play, Gamma ray spray Rae, he tried to pray
He threw a grand away, yo, I plan a day to drive his land away
Doe or die, right, light up the time my ?feet? was gear high
Showing love to niggaz on the inside

(AZ)
Black supreme, high king, mine shine like high beams
We be that Don ?queen? seems you take time in a hygiene
My line ?queen?, Italian gator, boast made of fiend
Check the Firm team, names internationally reign
Triple X large, duplex wit a garage
Gold Express Cards plus enuff sex to bless the Gods
So let's play, catch me in a Motown Cafe
Cap on half way, sipping OJ and ?cram on lye?
Doe or die way, ?corosea?
