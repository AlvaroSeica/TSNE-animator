[Isaiah Rashad]
I take a drag of the square - I feel anxious, spit dangerous
as the verbal appears, is reflecting my perspective
Beer, goggle, and fear; role model so hallow
Shadow adolescence and a gaggle of them bitches
Road to the riches still paved with the ditches
Get caught up in the hype, your career is for a night
I ain't these other niggas, cause these niggas is fake
They ain't poppin' shot, these niggas is Papa Doc
If I ain't shinin', beat me up in a rhyme spot
No cryin' 'til I'm in a pine box
I got the bitches hittin' Mikey like where Zay at?
Probably fuckin' on her friend, probably LA at (WHOO)
Probably plotting on a mil staying where Fay at (WHOO)
Bitch don't run your mouth, we don't play that
Mama taught me better; can't count on niggas
Can't count on weather - go figure, nigga!
They ain't worried about this cheddar
Them niggas just sky diving in my propellers, I don't feel them (nah)
Ain't trying to be no freshman, I'm chillin' (nah)
Cause they'll bring a knife to the fight, and not kill em (BAP)
Me and my niggas is hungry, we're willing (BAP)
to bring a little ho to the +Party+ and Meek Mill 'em
Yeah, I feel like talkin' my shit
Come in the house, acting friendly, you can suck my dick!
I'm prayin' for some good rappers and a fleetwood
Where I gotta bring my A game, you just D goods
We don't wanna hear that weak shit, nigga speak up
Rocking old flows corn rows and a beeper
You niggas hoes, you niggas hoes, and I ain't even trippin
Cause we'll be laughin' to the bank and ridin' by these niggas
Mikey bring that mink with your low body Bentley
Put the hood in the fuckin' trunk and bring the party with me

[Chorus: Isaiah Rashad - singing]
I came, I saw, I conquered, ay, I shot you down
Now, your brain don't have no conscious, ay - what you do now?
Now, I came, I saw, I conquered, ay, I shot you down
Now, I bang, I bang, I blocka, ay - what you do now?
Ol' bitch ass rappers, ay, I shot you down
Ol' sensitive niggas, ay, I shot you down
Ol' bitch ass rappers, ay, I shot you down
Ol' hypebeast pussies, ay, what you do now?
Now, I came, I saw, I conquered, ay, I shot you down
Now, your brain don't have no conscious, ay - don't make a sound
Now, I came, I saw, I conquered, ay - what you do now?
Now your brain don't have no conscious, ay - what you doÂ—don't make a sound
Haha - BITCH!</pre>
