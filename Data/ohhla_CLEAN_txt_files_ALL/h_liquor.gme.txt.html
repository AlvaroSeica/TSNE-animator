[The Game]
Dre you musta been off the Hennessy when you did this one nigga

[Jellyroll]
Hard liquorrrrr
Hard liquorrrrr...

[Intro: Jellyroll]
Is there anymore, hard liquorrrrr
Make sure that it's mixed, and twisted
with a lit-tle bit of lemon juice
On ice, on ice, on ice, yeahhhhhhh

[The Game]
You know me I turn them 40 bottles upside down
Like niggaz with dead homies 'til it's empty like my fo' pound
Niggaz thinkin I'm drunk; reach for my N.W.A. chain
and get yo' ass beat with the pump
Tell security it's Game plus 50
And he probably get fucked up every night like Bobby dp Whitney
Fuck poppin Cristal, I got a bottle of Henny
And me and my nine stay together like Hardaway and Lil' Penny
I ain't here so you can ask about Em or Dre
I came to see some bitches shake they ass like Beyonc√©
So let me be Hov' for a minute, get up in your hoe for a minute
You could be my hoe for a minute
Like I'm Diddy, be J-Lo for a minute
From the windows to the wall, gettin low while I'm in it
All I gotta do is hit 'em with a Jay-Z line
like "you deserve to be my sunshine"

[Chorus: Jellyroll]
Out on the floor, she's sexyyyyy
Tell her where the af...ter party is
But make sure that you see her friends
Before, before, before, hmmmmmmmmm

[The Game]
I'll spend a hundred dollars take a bitch to the Hyatt
Then treat her like Busta, +Light Her Ass On Fire+
I'm a gangsta ma, I wanna see you wiggle your butt cheeks
Both hands around your ankles ma
All I wanna see is ass and titties
Shake it like they do in Magic City when T.I. in that muh'fucker
I'm like fifty P.I. in this muh'fucker
You seee the gold D's on that Porsche truck?
I'll show you how gangsters fuck
My forty-five to the back of you and both of your arms in handcuffs
Take a bottle of Cisco to the head
See how you like gettin fucked with a pistol to your head?
Tell your girls I fucked your brains out
We can do a menage-a-trois pull the whips and chains out
I tear that frame out, I ain't no stunt man
I pull that Range out... bitch~!

[Chorus]

[The Game]
I got 40's like the liquor sto'
Po' it on your weave like that bitch in the "G Thang" video
You look wet, let me help you out your Von Dutch and
I know you used to niggaz spinnin but tonight I'm fuckin
The truck stop, the rims spin, I know they hate me fuck 'em
It's killer Cali nigga haters come a dime a dozen
Load up shells then I get drunk pissy
This bottle of Hennessy got me wantin to fuck Missy
I'ma gangster I can turn the bitch out
Play with her pussy, then drop ecstasy in her Cristal
Sixty seconds later I'm kickin that bitch out
Then ride down the 'Shaw with the four-fifth out
Stop at the sto' that bitch emptied my Crist' out
Gimme fifty feet or I'll empty this clip out
Niggaz wanna know what this L.A. shit 'bout
Just visit when the Bloods and Crips out

[Outro] - same as [Intro]</pre>
