Typed by: Metro Lyrics

[Chorus]
See you grabbin' on my tooly
She told me smack her on the booty
She say I got too many hoes
She say I got too many shows

But she twerking (8xs)

[Ca$h Out]
Whats up, baby? I see you, you watching
Versace like Biggie, my watch is Rolly
This hoe say holly molly, you stole it
Oh, no, no, pay for it, be foreign, go touring
A nigga so burry, drive her out when hes snoring
He kiki for the free-free took lil kiki to Waikiki
Put Louis, with Gucci, put a hoochie with a hoochie
We do the hoochie coochie but Im still grabbing on my tooly

[Chorus]
See me, baby, now Imma do it
She told me smack her on the booty
She say I got too many hoes
She say I got too many shows

But she twerking (8xs)

[Ca$h Out]
Ferrari, retarded, no bank, retarded
These hoes, they tardy, they missing, Im sorry
Ferragamo for freak-o, I seize this cappuccino
Baby, Im beating nino, that your boyfriend, I bet you he know
Got your girl saying I want to do foo-foo
Got your girl at my front door in a tutu
Yeah, she got that million dollar mouth, ooh, ooh
Spenz and dyeing on a beast, say ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
See me, baby, now Imma do it
She told me smack her on the booty
She say I got too many hoes
She say I got too many shows

But she twerking (8xs)</pre>
