[Chorus 2X: Random]
We gon' rock right, stock right, 'til we got it locked tight
Hot like cruisin through the stoplight, that's right
Roll hard, go hard, Bogart, whole squad
Buy you every minute like a pre-paid phone card

[Random]
My spectacular vernacular makes me rap with a chip on my scapula
When I'm attackin ya it's a massacre
Danger is imminent when Random be rippin it
Half of my fans are participants, philanthropists or hypocrites
See I'm a man among infants and the difference is persistance
From this distance I can't hear your whispers
But don't risk it, cause the slightest inference'll
get you done like the dishes I'm knee deep in the trenches
Resistance is senseless, man you done crossed the line
You lost your mind? I'm sharper than porcupines
And your shine? Of course it's mine
I'm sick - stuffy head fever, nauseous I'm
a problem, word to Big Ran, rip jams
Regardless of what it scan, yo it's bland
On the warpath, a storm is in the forecast
Charge into battle like Leroy in Warcraft
Leroy!!! And only nerds'll get that
Step back, you in the deathtrap, screamin EFF RAP
I'm level 99, y'all dudes just try to rhyme
Better off with a life of crime than tryin to bite these lines
You wanna fight me fine, this destined is by design
I show up and rappers go SWOOSH~! Like the Nike sign
How you gon' hate son, Mega Ran's the great one
That you ain't safe from with the same dude that laced Pun
No jewlery, you still can't fool with me musically
Do the knowledge, go ahead and Google me
Or get your readin up, check out Wikipedia
You see me leavin crates in the game like a meteor
And the media they finally recognizin
We enterprisin and probably see millions on the horizon
It makes no difference man, y'all can't spit with Ran
When I hit Japan, fans gon' call me ICHIBAN

[Chorus]

{Here we go! FINAL STRIKE}</pre>
