[Chorus: Game]
My Phantom's so mean
Like I wash that motherfucker every Sunday in holy water
My Jesus piece clean
Even my shoes are Christians, I'm walkin on holy water
She came out them True Religion jeans
And fell straight to her knees like she was dipped in holy water
Holy water...
Holy water

[Game]
Back when Michael Jordan was raw
'92 was the year my city was City of God
Coke on the boulevard, crack fiends skiing the slaloms
is exactly how drug lords found their way from the bottom
Them Yeezy's drop got 'em, couldn't afford 'em you shot 'em
Cause they the same price of fuckin Red Bottoms
We don't pop tags, leave that motherfucker on it
and return it back to the store when you no longer want it
Sleep outside for days for a pair of J's
Then you sleep outside forever cause you got sprayed
If you gon' die for 'em, they better be #4's
or some shit made in Japan you can never find in the stores
Rolex watches, Gucci belts, and Louis luggage
Definitely set us apart from niggaz when we in public
Jeffery Campbell and Michael Kors got you lookin rugged
Gave her a Louis bag, now she love me
Take a look at her posin on my car cause

[Chorus]

[Game]
Met a girl named Christian in some Christians, she a Christian
Suck a dick like suckin dick is her life's mission
Tryin to save her is like, tryin to save a stripper
She fine as fuck, you tryin to fuck, that's the reason you tip her
And all I'm sayin is a watch and a gold chain
can't make Bobby Valentino Johnny Coltrane
And she knows this, that's why her mouth wide
Openin her legs straight up like they suicide
I cross my heart and hope to die
if somethin happens to my voice and I can no longer provide
Should I run and hide? No, hustle and survive
Work a 9-to-5 until sweat drips into my eyes
And if it burns like the kush then I go back to sellin pies
Switchin lanes in that Cutlass, rubbin her thighs while I drive
Reminiscin on the days I was rollin broke
Jesus piece on the rearview, holy ghost
Amen~!
