"My man Illus, check it out yo"

[Illus]
I love hip-hop with all my heart (all my heart)
I never cared about bein a star
But I work hard to make a living
So when I'm spittin, I'm givin you my all
I got a family I love with all my soul
and when I hug 'em, man I never wanna let go (never)
I live for my son and beautiful wife
I got a smile, it's a magical life
And I don't say you this to boast or brag
I wish everyone had what I have
I know I'm blessed, I don't take it for granted
It hasn't always gone according to plan, kid
I failed plenty, and lost a lot of fights
Been rejected more times than I care to write
Had my heart broken, had my dreams crushed
But never gave up hope, I just kept up
And never quit fightin, never quit drawin
Never quit writing, life's too exciting
And I love livin, I seen the birth of my son
A gift that keeps giving, and I'ma keep winning
With my family by my side, I can't fail
I just tell my tale and set sail
And let the winds of life guide my focus
And live loving all the magical moments

[Chorus: Illus]
You gotta open your eyes and open your mind
Open your heart and see the beauty in life (It's so magical)
You gotta live and learn and grow
and embrace the wisdom of time and share your light
You gotta open your eyes and open your mind
Open your heart and see the beauty in life (It's so magical)
You gotta live and learn and grow
and embrace the wisdom of time and share your light

"Check it out, yo it's J-Live"

[J-Live]
Grown-ass man, plan from the beginning
Pits the game, it's no need for extra innings
My home run goes 360 degrees
to walk off slow, enjoyin the breeze
A square in the circle, I navigate, with ease
The trail that was blazed by previous emcees
Machette to the growth of the weeds, so the seeds
could walk the same path that my history reads
For the road less traveled in the grand scheme
I hit the road worldwide and do the damn thing
For the family we do it most honorably
A proud father and a son, I'm both honored to be
A humble student and a teacher most definitely
And life's test and lil' stress is not gettin to me
Learn the lesson, know that truth could ALWAYS be questioned
The science is the magic, it's no need for guessin

[Chorus]</pre>
