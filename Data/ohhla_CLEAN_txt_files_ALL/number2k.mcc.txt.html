[Intro from a Charlie Brown cartoon]
All I want is what I, I have coming to me
All I want is my fair share

[mc chris]
Good evening ladies this is mc chris
You know I know how to love
Loving'ss what I do best
For those of you that aren't impressed
Dry yo' eye
mc chris, will arrive

[singers - repeat 4X]
mc chris #1 with the ladies
Got you foamin at the mouth like a dog with rabies

[mc chris]
This ones for the ladies, the crazy honey babies
The biddies with the shitties that drive Jimmy dizzy at the mini-mall
Arby's sauce on my lapel
I'm chilling a the perfume counter so I can smell
the intoxicating breezes, bring on wheezes and sneezes
Have me over, for dinner, and let me eat your feces
I go to pieces cause I fall in love five times a day
my name is mc chris before you buy like doing KLJ
mc chris, I'm number 2000
with the ladies so the crowd keeps shoutin
You can't help it if you find him attractive
Cause mc chris is the motherfuckin mack, shit

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
mc chris, I'm number 2000
with the ladies so the crowd keeps shoutin
You can't help it if you find him attractive
Cause mc chris is the motherfuckin mack, shit

[mc chris]
What one? Fuck that, I'm number infin'
As in "In Like Flynt," so please let me begin
Obviously I'm mc, worrrd I deserve it
As for the many cuties that let me berserk it
I work the circuit, from XLR to RCA
I get up on the mic about every damn day
All the way from Sante Fe over to the Ukraine
I get more insane than my boy Billy Zane
On the Titanic, leaving all the ladies in a Leonardo panic
Automatic but I turn it like it's static
I lock them upstairs just like flowers in the attic
Like she was Kimmy Gibbler, and I was Bob Saget

[Chorus]

[mc chris]
Amazing, the act of body painting
I get up on the mic 'til I leave all the ladies fainting
In my life it's always raining but yo it's not cats and pups
It's me wearing hoes with big ass butts
We've been known to rock, we've been known to party
We've been known to strip and shake our bodies
You like our show, you like our sound?
Motherfucker put your money down

[Chorus]

[repeat 4X]
The mack shit, the mack shit
Who is the motherfuckin mack shit?

[Outro]
Ooooooooh yeah
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus!!</pre>
