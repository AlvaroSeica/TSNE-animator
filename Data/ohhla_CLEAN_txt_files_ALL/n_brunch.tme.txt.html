60 years ago today
Crowley taught Calm. to play
The little fun songs
For the little numb kids
But the teacher had snake eyes and a fork tongue kiss

They said we've been going in and out of style
But we're guaranteed to raise an anti-smile
So pack up the drugs and the controversy
The contrabands in your ear and naked dinner's got the mercy

So may I introduce to you? 
The act you've known for all these years
Put away the junk and dissolve the fear
It's naked dinner's lonely brunch club band
The dinner is naked

(Time and Extra Kool)
We're naked dinner's lonely brunch club band
We hope that you enjoy the show
We're naked dinner's lonely brunch club band
Sit back and let the evening go.
Naked dinner's lonely, naked dinner's lonely
We're naked dinner's lonely brunch club band
It's wonderful to be here
It's certainly a thrill
You're such a lovely audience
We'd like to take you home with us
We'd love to take you home
All aboard 

I don't really want to stop the show
But I thought that you might like to know
That Time's got the mic and the feelings right
And if we all come together we can turn the dark to light

So the singer's going to sing a song
And he wants you all to sing along
So let me introduce to you
The one and only Billy Cooper
And naked dinner's lonely brunch club band


And no one is (living)
And no one whoever told the truth is (living)</pre>
