[Intro]
We smokin fatty blunts {?}
We woulda stabbed you the fuck up
and put you in the back of the Caddy trunk
Hehe, yeah, ladies and gentlemen
Get your cocaine and your heroin
You're in a situation that you can never win
You notice that right away
This is your world, this is your world
And this is my world...

[Slaine]
It's like I'm walkin by Jesus freaks in the cheapest sneaks
With the sounds of cell phones and beeper beeps
Hot blocks with drug spots on the corner
Gum white-out blunts rollin marijuana
And I'm just trying to get by runnin through the city
The same bums with me, with the rum shitty
fuck the dum diddy, this society
I got my eyes on them because they're eyin me
And I hate the greedier likes to the media hype
Cause these are the skeeviest types
Believe me I can't take it easy at night
I'm having dreams of the devil that ain't leaving m right
I'm convinced I'm a prince, I glimpse at the blimps
The hookers and the rookies and the pimps with the limps
I've rinsed, my hands of the newspaper prints
that hints at the filthiness of my environments
They've got tecs to squeeze and ecstasies
Unmarked cars with detectives, "Freeze~!"
And you, you walkin right next to these
Fuckin raw dog 'til you get a sex disease

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Yo this is my life, blurred city lights
Got society eyin me, is he blind?
But this is your world, look at all the madness
Do you have this in your sight? Look around

[Slaine]
Yo this is what we callin life
You shouldn't have stepped in front of the alcoholic's knife
You call it wrong
But this is what we callin right, right?
Aiyyo money rules it all from lawyers to politics
High school bitches who strip for scholarships
That gangster shit, swallow hollow tips
The game of life is played for thousand dollar chips
Follow this, they call Japs gooks, blacks spooks
Whites crackers, so you grill whoever looking at you
Villains in all colors, our forefathers
But why don't you take a look where your heart is?
Filled with more garbage, that's why we sniff and get high
Bullshittin sittin underneath magnificent skies
So my lyrics are are a sketch you catchin whiffs of the lies
And my breath's a 100 proof, it wreaks of the truth
I speak to the youth take leaks in the booth
Piss warm with the shit storm the speakers are blew
Look around what society is teachin to you
What you ain't doin dirt? You got your feet in it too

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Look around... {*3X*}</pre>
