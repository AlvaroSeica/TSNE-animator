(Intro, Juicy J)
I get so damn trippy
In my mind; I go blank
Then touching in her wrappers
Number one is my rank

(Hook, Juicy J)
You say no to drugs
Juicy J cain't (Mhmm)
You say-you say no to drugs
Juicy-Juicy J cain't (Trippy!)
You say no to drugs
Juicy J cain't (Mhmm)
You say-you say no to drugs
Juicy-Juicy J cain't (Trippy!)

I get so damn trippy, in my mind; I go blank
Then touching in her wrappers
Number one is my rank

You say no to drugs
Juicy J cain't (Mhmm)
You say-you say no to drugs
Juicy-Juicy J cain't (Trippy!)
You say no to drugs
Juicy J cain't (Mhmm)
You say-you say no to drugs
Juicy-Juicy J cain't (Trippy!)

Juicy J-Juicy J-Juicy J-Juicy J
Juicy-Juicy-Juicy-Juicy
Juicy J cain't

(Verse 1, Juicy J)
Lean overflowin like New Orleans' broken levies (Damn!)
No relationships wit ho's; I just want that "becky" (Damn)
I'm bout my money; I gets my fetti (You know it!)
Street nigga; North Memphis
Bitch I still rep it! (Trippy!)
Smokin weed from the bong
And the lean got me sprung (Trippy!)
Molly in my veins; Got my heart beatin like a drum (Trippy!)
Grindin on my teeth, like a nigga chewin gum (Trippy!)
Eyes Chinese tight; But I don't work it young (Trippy!)
Juicy so high; I feel like that I'm on a cloud (Trippy nigga!)
Weed don't talk; But this shit I got here "loud" (Trippy!)
After the show; We grab the groupie ho's, I'm smokin out (Trippy, yep)
No smoke for free; No I-O-U's; No, I don't do no vows (Trippy)

(Hook)

(Verse 2, Juicy J)
The club doped out; We dopin
Shawty got that ass poked out; But I'm pokin
I get that cap and gown; Like I'm graduated (Uh-huh!)
Shawty straight on the business; She ain't hesitatin (No sir!)
I'm on that loud; You on that hush
Nigga I'm the shit; Can't be flushed (Mm-m)
I'm gettin money, ballin; without a contract
I ain't gotta smoke for you to catch a contact
I shoot guns; I don't blow guns
Smoked so much, I shoulda had four lungs
I'm smokin, til' my money gone
And that's no time soon; Cause my money long
