[Chorus: Musiq (Black Thought)]
Comin to break you off (we started.....we started-started..)
Comin to break you off (we started.....we started-started..)
Comin to break you off (we started.....we started-started..)
Comin to break you off (we started.....comin to break you off)
Comin to break you off (tell em to work it... tell em to work it out)
Comin to break you off (tell em to work it... tell em to work it out)
Comin to break you off (tell em to work it, work it, out... tell em to work it out)
Comin to break you off (we started.....comin to break you off)
Yeah Baby

[Black Thought]
Bad misses throwin raspberry kisses on me
You looking for direction girl, I feel your vision on me
Just dont let him see you sweatin, we aint 'spose to be involved
Knowing when we get it off, girl I mean it all
Keeping you fiending 'til you taken and tossed
And when I'm breaking it off, its no denying the fact - it's wrong
'Cause you got a man who's probably playing his part
You probably breaking his heart, He trying to figure the reason you gone
Is it 'cause he's superficial, or is he too submissive
Or did I come along and hit you with the futuristic
Or is it 'cause you really couldn't see a future with him
All he about is paper, never took the time with you to listen
You want it gripped up, flipped, and thrown
An' get stripped and shown, the way to get in the zone - of course
...Dealing with this you won't be taking a loss
You need to leave him alone
And roll with the one who breaking you off...

[Chorus]

[Black Thought (Musiq)]
Brother down the hall, the one you bound to call
Workaholic, so really I'm rarely around at all
What we started got serious reprecautions in court
We had a chance to turn back, but look now its all
Late nights twistin something listenin to Neicey sing
She got the beat for you telling me you deeply
Appreciate the company, time we spend
I feel the same, it's a shame you ain't my girlfriend (my girl)
Cuz listen, you need a brotha with the physical fix
That come through in the mix for you with no head tricks or fraud
You need a new position and who can get you open
Like a eucalyptus and have ready to go for yours
Come on and work with me, you won't get hurt with me
Just keep it real and you'll get broken off certainly
Dealing with this you won't be taking a loss
You need to leave him alone
And roll with the one who's breaking you off

Chorus

[Black Thought]
Rollin down the highway, listening to Sade sing
The way the "Smooth Operator" move my way
You sitting beside me looking like Friday Foster
Pam Grier structure - look at your body
Keep each other thirsty, kisses like Hershey
But lips is sealed cuz we don't need a controversy
I say I'm in town, you say you want it in the worst way?
You probably told your man it was your mother's birthday
Meanwhile it's champagne chillin in ice
You ready for the freakiest things you've done in your life
We break it down like road dogs pulling a heist
You makin sounds like the vibe gotcha reaching your height
Prepare for flight, this is your captain I'm getting strapped in
There's no denying the strength that it's attraction - girl
working with this you won't be taking a loss
So stop fooling your man
And roll with the one who's breaking you off

[Musiq]
Baby, baby, baby... Don't you worry bout (no babe)
nothing cuz I'm comin to...
Handle you no doubt
Whenever you want that thing you need (I got it)
and then I aim to please
I'm coming over to give it to you babe (babe)

Comin to Break You Off
Comin to Break You Off
Comin to Break You Off
Comin to Break You Off
Yeah Babe {Repeat 4x}
