[Intro: Chamillionaire]
Uhh
Hold up, hold up
Chamilitary mayne~! Ay from now on
when y'all spell my name
Make sure you capitalize the C
and put a dollar sign above every I
I feel like that's how y'all should address me
Hold up, I work hard for my paper man
I've been doin this for what, 11, 12, 13
MAN somebody get a calculator
I think I lost count
Whattup Watts? Whattup Z-Ro? Whattup Rap-A-Lot?
H-Town whassup? Hakeem Olajuwon, Slow City Don
Hold up!

[Chamillionaire]
Slow loud and bangin man I'm the man
I never been your fan and I ain't never been a Stan
Sayin I'm the man cause I told you that I am
I'm on super poked swangers you can check my wingspan
I don't mess with y'all man, I'm anti-social
I don't talk too much, I'm anti-vocal
Y'all ain't goin nowhere, y'all anti-coastal
And ya'll ain't gettin no mail, y'all anti-postal
Speakers soundin like a marchin band
Laws hopin that my pockets full of contraband
Boys thinkin 'bout plottin when I park my Lam'
I'm a spray you cockroaches like the Orkin man
Lookin so regal, hopin out a Regal
Not the Birdman but I'm ridin with a Eagle
I don't know who the hell tellin you that I need you
They got you gassed up girl, I hope your usin diesel
Whoa Kimosabe~! Groupies in the lobby
Flyin outta Hobby like flyin is a hobby
Boys wanna rob me, go ahead and try me
Just know I own way mo' +Heat+ than Pat Riley
Your girlfriend, recommend that, I molest her
At the UFH I shoulda been a professor
Open up my wallet and pretend I'ma test her
She turnin in paper like it's end of semister
Ready to poker her, livin la vida loca
Come at me wrong I'm at'cha neck like a choker
When I recline, I'm sittin in it like a sofa
Drive it once then I give away the vehicle like Oprah
Chauffeur, Mr. Belvadere, that's the butler
Told ya, let her disappear, never cuff her
Roller, money everywhere in my duffle
Hold up, I can't even hear that's my muffler
Damn~! Loud pipes got me soundin super sexy
+Blades+ everywhere make your woman think I'm Wesley
Ask the police when they gonna come arrest
If I do a crime it'll be the day they catch me
Rims sittin high, you can call me high roller
Ice on both wrists, you can call me bi-polar
Go against me, you should know your life over
Your girl goin crazy, you should know that I drove her
Manage the wheel, they know Cham is for real
Now that I am independent they gon' panic for real
From the land of the trill, before they hand me a deal
I will slap that boy with a backhand full of bills
Gettin that cabbage, that's been established
In the new crib where the layout is lavish
Money Jurassic, Amex is blackness
Naked lady standin like she straight out a pageant
Haters, you should go get yourself a razor
Look at your wrist and go on do yourself a favor
Watch the one-time the police'll try to taze ya
Pistol jam on me, I'ma switch it up and blade ya
You don't know me you can diss away
I ain't waitin 'til tomorrow I'm a trip today
Stop actin like you hard, y'all should switch to gay
Y'all boys sweeter than a lemonade at Chick Fil-A, ay!

Got to come down got to be the damn best
Jewellery gon' shine that il be on my chest
Rain or sunshine I admit that I'm fresh
And ya already knowin what I rep, yep
I was always on grind while them other boys slept
Money on time, bet' not be a dime less
Gotta bunch of dimes and they hit me on texts
Just to tell me that I always be the best
Yep, I'm the best

I got to +touch-down+ and show my endzone skills
But when I touch down it's probably in Brazil
Diamonds on froze so my wrists on still
Never on safety, my fo'-fifth on kill
See me out there she tried to get my address
Plenty hoes pose and change clothes like pageants
Headboard that's in my bedroom is so padded
Plenty dope lines for these hoes like tablets
Tongue'll get stuck on my gold it's so icy
Tongue'll stay stuck on my pole the hoe like me
Haters back at home ain't made enough to come fight me
I'm in New York sittin courtside like I'm Spike Lee
Always winnin like I'm Bryant with fo' Lakers
Got'cha woman sippin Hennessy with no chaser
Everytime I see him that Chamillion hold paper
Got her sayin "Koopa what the hell is yo' safe for?"
Got these boys sayin that she mines and don't touch her
Then she tell you to stop cryin and don't cuff her
I convince a girl to strip down with no muscle
Went out to the A and took a dime to know Usher
Went out to the Lou' and took a dime to know Nelly
Went out to the Chi and took a dime to know Kelly
Plus the chick that say she cool with Drake was so ready
But none of 'em done tripped cause they know that's so petty
In the Panamera with the shoes
Gettin plenty knowledge like she takin me to school
Say I don't go hard they gon' say that you a fool
It's gon hit you like BLAOW when I hit you with the tool</pre>
