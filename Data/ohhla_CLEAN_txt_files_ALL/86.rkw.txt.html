[Intro: Raekwon]
Ok ok ok ok! I see her
I see that! Turn me up turn me up!
Gimme some juices! Gimme some juices kid
Come on! Let's go man for real!

[Verse One: Raekwon]
Aiyyo! Aiyyo wood grain jacket and the clapper
Catch me inside Mojito City with a stretch plum actress
Grabbin her thong, the light skin Nia Long
Rich niggas way back, when bitch knew John
Why would you ever wanna be here?!
Guns bigger than me yeah I'm like the centerpede three pair
Wallabee first pair ferocious
Guns from Scotia everybody know I flow like oceans
Truck little pieces, how we gonna eat this
I walk around fly, high, telekinesis 
And my lady, a well known designer
Who fell in lined with me, and all she do is sell L.B.
We in the grow house, trees look alone
I built the dutchmaster train set kid relax you home
And watchin Carmelo and the Knicks go in
I'm playin my square I'm in the front row my bitch roll in
That's not wifey, that's a lover
She gave me some top but how we met she was alone with my brother
Givin twenty year veteran good dick, came to my senses
Stay strong like old men and dentures
Winter time rockin a fox hangin with Bruno Mars, The LOX
Sting, yo Nas's pops
We gettin honeys, ratpack clique and my gunny 
Blowin two L's +Ocean Eleven+ this money
Floss days coolin on them horses
Hop over logs, long polo boots on to them porches
Maxin king everything gucci
Just like the suits I play saturday to stay in jacuzzis
Brother man I flown on the motherlands
And came back quick, ounces of gold, wrapped inside rubberbands
Hangin in my cormega schmidts
Doin my O.G. thing slingin some 'caine in the mix

[Chorus: Altrina Renee]
He got my flyin to the islands when it's cold outside
Matchin furs his and hers black, matchin black cars
Got my life livin right baby, love is no limit
Life's good either way, long as you win it

[Outro: Raekwon]
Yeah! yo be easy chef be easy man!
Word up next year man, you could have it man
The whole year you heard, twenty years of rap nigga!
Professionally! Logistically! Scientifically! It's real!
Ice Age 2.0 you already know
And we ain't stoppin! We ain't never 'gon stop!
Real! Real! Real! Real! Real! </pre>
