Uh its Werd
Scottish Hip hop now its on

Wicked wicked now its on

[Werd]
The UK rap game am not init
But when am back home flow every minute
Are you OK cause I'm sick with the lyric
So dont play cause I spit photogenic
Comic strip spit see a rip speech bubbles
Take out two B's attached them to both knuckles
Beat you off the page
And they say I've got issues
Plus they knows am a blow like tissues
A wont diss you
I'll put cunts at you
God bless me
A dont think that he had to
I shit on rappers got skill out the ass dude
If you dont believe me
Who the fuck asked you
I'll hit you with a glass and a'l smash you
Hit you with a cup and I mug you
Unplug mics and I will just plug you
Fuck you the DJ will cut you
You can drop in the club 
Thats what you want huh?
Drop in the club or to leak in the street
Got beef like meat then you leak when me meet
Make cunts bleed like the first time in the sheets
Like every four weeks four knuckles in your teeth
And you face defeat when my feets in your face
Rockports rock your jaw like the E you ate
And I'm easy take 8 like seven mistakes
Like cut
Take it from the top now great
Ok your gay no way can you match me
Dont play flow spray all day at ye
Its like we bump cabs and they cant catch us
Mixtape money so I dont pay taxis

[Werd]
Nah a dont pay taxes
Nah a dont pay taxes
Fuck taxes</pre>
