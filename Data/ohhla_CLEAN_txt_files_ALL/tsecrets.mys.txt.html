Hahaha, yeah-yeah
Hilltop Hoods, Mys' Diggi Down Unda
Say it man

Yo, check it
If I'm not cloud stepping, this underground weapon's
Probably somewhere out repping where a hungry crowd's sweating
When this thunder mouth steps in, it's a must I sound fresh
You're as thick as my dick thinking that I'm not sound checking
You know Mys' is on his toes and always lively from the go
But believe you'll never see him eating right before the show
Because being full up's an uncomfortable feeling
Whilst running around stage and tryna crumble your ceiling
The same thing goes for being drunk and stuff
You see I'd love to but I might cuss too much
And I ain't tryna offend, my steps stumble while I rock the house and
Puffing and drinking before would just give me cottonmouth
And we don't need that like microphone feedback
Plus if it ain't a cordless, best to side with a lead tap
Before you're seen flat on your face, but if that was the case
A real emcee should pull you back in your place

[Chorus]
You see we got skills to prove and we're built to do this
So don't be surprised if you feel the music
Time after time the crowd remains speechless
So for the love of it now we trade secrets
And keep coming with sound that shakes speakers
And always give it up to the crowd cause they need this
And if he does it the same, he ain't a genius
Nah man nah, he just listened to Trade Secrets
Now say la-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Coming with the la-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Come on, come on, la-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Coming with the la-da-da-da

[Pressure]
This is the rapper's guide to survival
Chapter one, side with the rival
Keep your enemies close and bide in your time till
It's the night of your title, with your finest recital
Get some personal punch lines on 'em, timing is vital
Chapter two, the sex and skirts, pack an extra shirt and cologne
You ain't gonna bone stinking of sweat and dirt
Be sure of one thing before you set to work
Your plan of attack, her man has a knack to gets necks to hurt
Chapter three, keep a sober mind, after the show is fine
Nothing worse than a rapper that doesn't know his rhymes
It's cool, we all unfocused at times
Just make sure your partner in rhyme knows it in mime
Chapter four, know you're worthless for starters son
You're only as dope as your worst track, not your hardest one
After you're done, pay respect for how far that you've come
And you'll be a jack-of-all-trades, I'll be a master of one

[Chorus]

[Suffa]
If you ain't sweating like a pig, work harder, then you ain't doing it right
If you fuck up, smile like to do it was tight
You wanna come through on the mic? Then don't cup it
"Keep your hands off it" Damn right, you look like you wanna suck it dude
It ain't a dude, it's a mic, it ain't Mike your boyfriend
You look like you swallowing pipe
Come here and follow my boy if you wanna be tight
Cause you don't wannabe a wannabe, you wannabe hype, right?
You wanna rock a crew with super hunnies?
You better coat that flow in Manuka honey
Because man it's super funny to see a super dummy
Come bounce around on stage like he's doing bungees
Standing up, I've had enough of these jokers when they
Think they kick it, they ain't even spoke to Sensei
Or learnt the trade secrets, saw the way we get
The crowd off their feet and heard the play we get

[Chorus]

[Mystro]
You lot learned a lesson from that man
Oi Presh, Suff, Debris, you know we got to go and do the show right?
We got to bounce man, come on man
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!
Haha, after the show...</pre>
