[Lil 1/2 Dead]
It all started back in 83'
It's when I first came an O.B.G
The set that I claim was the L.BC
And none of these niggas couldn't see H.D (Whys that)
Cause I got it going on 
I'm flocking new bitches and my paper is low (Like what)
Like the beach and the city I'm from
And H.D dogg getting bitches sprung (Off what)
Off the dick, so take an lick 
And hurry up and get out of my face you trick ass bitch
Cause I don't give an fuck about an hoe
Even though I got in the game in 94'
I still got it going on and I bust an gain bitches because my game is strong
And hoes be clocking me, straight jocking me
In the party even if I'm with somebody

[Lil 1//2 Hook]
Why should an nigga ever try to be
So mother fucking fresh and fly as me
And why should an bitch should ever lie to me
That gangsta ass nigga name young H.D

[chorus 2x]
Young H.D why is he such an old B.G.E 
 
[Lil 1/2 Dead]
Now H.D dogg is an mack you see
I been on a mission since 83'
The city that I well is the L.B.C
H.D dogg will stay an G
Be on a mission clocking ends and shit 
And he be on the mission try to check an bitch
He be on the mission try to straight get paid
He be on the mission and try to have it made
So I could live like the rest of them
And when it's time to floss, I'm with the best of them
Living lavage and straight be clocking ends and shit
Cause I'm going to keep going and it just want quit, shit
I'm going to stay fly to I die and every single day I straight get high
Off drank or maybe even off of some bomb ass weed
Why should I be an O.B.G
[Lil 1/2 Dead Hook 2x]

[chorus 2x] 

[Lil 1/2 dead]
I beat you down like an boxer
Got your girl and rocked her
Never ever jocked her, she talk shit I socked her
All in her mouth cause I got some much class
If their an party in her house I'm turning it out (That's right)
That nigga H.D in the place to be and I'm still C walking on 21 street
It's me the little nigga that would never drop
Playing keys and cavi and just won't stop 
Clocking fat ass knots and I got four stops
Cause I got three glocks in case you want to get shot
It's hot in the spot where I slangs my dope
Don't coming around tripping we ain't no joke loc
You gets smoke like an fat ass joint
And right about now you reach the turning point
In your life for fucking with me 
And why should I be an O.B.G

[Lil 1/2 Dead Hook]
