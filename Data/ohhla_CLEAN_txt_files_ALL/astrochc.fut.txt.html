[Intro]
Yeah~!!
Whattup baby?

[Chorus]
You a astronaut chick
and that's the only thing that matter to me, you were made to be
on a whole 'nother level, me and you we light the room up when we together
Everytime we havin sex we ain't gotta break a sweat
Cause we some space cadets
And we don't wanna go to sleep, cause we too obsessed
with the high life, and we gon' blast up
like a rocket when the time right, and when the time right

[Future]
And your style is impeccable, you're so fuckin incredible
You don't drop off your pedestal, well you shine like a bezel boo
Saks Fifth Avenue, I'm tryin to buy you the avenue
You a astronaut baby, everything we do brand new
More water than Cancun, me and you we some tycoons
We light up a whole room, we hot in that bedroom
More love than February, this shhh ain't no fairy-tary
The highest level you can go, we blow up to legendary
This outer space lingo I fuck with only when necessary
You an honor to me, I got that lumber like trees
I wear my heart on my sleeve, you got my heart in my stomach
Without a doubt in my mind, I'm takin off and you comin

[Chorus]

[Future]
Top floor of the penthouse, on the rooftop poppin bottles
Shawty she go both ways anytime she go smash models
Addicted to the high life me and you we 'bout the same
Gucci Louis Prada when we walk it ain't no thang
Got them VVS diamonds, they go bling them bitches blang
Say you wanna go to Pluto, me and you we are the same
Everytime we get together extra fire to the flame
We was made for a space rocket, we don't ride planes
Take off, take off take off take off and play
Don't nothin compare to you, you in a whole 'nother class
You high-saditty and pretty, lights camera flashin
Focus on your future ain't concerned wit'cha past

[Chorus]

[Future]
She got that red on the bottom of her shoes (on her shoes)
With a brain like that, I can't lose (I can't lose)
And it ain't nothin for her I can't do (I wont' do)
And when I'm with her, ain't got nuttin to prove
She a sucker for me, and I take you for you
We get higher than skyscrapers and past the moon
We got a special connection and we could light up the room
We some astronauts baby, no cartoons
We outta here, and we ain't gon' never come to Earth again
We never touch the surf(ace) again, designer gear is all we in
Outer space status, the most incredible bond
And we full of passion, a whole lot of fashion

[Chorus]</pre>
