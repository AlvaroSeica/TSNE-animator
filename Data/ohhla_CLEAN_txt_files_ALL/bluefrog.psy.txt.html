Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[English Translation]
Ever since I was young, I couldn't hear other people's words
Was it because I was young? But even now, I can't hear them
What I heard the most as I lived is: If you keep this up, what will you become?
What I wanted to say to most as I lived is: I'll be fine on my own

Yeah, I'm a blue frog  no matter what anyone says, I am me
Even if I'm a frog in a pond, I'm happy  yes, that's just me
Yes, that's just me

Blue Frog

Blue Frog

Even if I think it's right, if someone tells me to do something, I won't listen
Even if I think it's wrong, if someone says it's right, I go against them
What I heard the most as I lived is: I'm doing this because I'm worried about you
What I wanted to say to most as I lived is: Please go worry about yourself

Yeah, I'm a blue frog  no matter what anyone says, I am me
Even if I'm a frog in a pond, I'm happy  yes, that's just me
Yes, that's just me

Blue Frog

Blue Frog

Let's Go
Ribbit ribbit, the frog is loudly, loudly, loudly shouting
Two blue frogs are singing  it's breathtaking

It's as if you purposely do the things I tell you not to do
Calling me a sad child that didn't get any attention? Do you know me?
You don't know me, what you think is just whatever  I just do what I want to
I'm a crazy person, I don't care what others think  no matter what anyone says, I do it my way ay
Just watch, see who ends up better in the end  you will be embarrassed
You will like me

Yeah, I'm a blue frog  no matter what anyone says, I am me
Even if I'm a frog in a pond, I'm happy  yes, that's just me
Yes, that's just me

Blue Frog

I'm not wrong, I'm just different
If you say it's a problem, then it's a problem
