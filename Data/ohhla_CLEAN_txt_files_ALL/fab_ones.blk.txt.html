Super fabulous the patterns have been uplifted 
smoke a chalice with the maddest and the most spliffted
turn the alphabet to calculus and flow swiftly
see the matter of the fact is that I'm so gifted
due payer you do say-a 
behead a terra formin in a toupee
a true player who moves layers of earth 
showin you are officially ridin with the crusaders
check it
i go hawaiian on an island in a phat tepee 
then down in colin for some dining in a black three piece 
im intertwining and aliging with a mack thesis 
the tongue of iron rule the lion of the rap species
i go abominable all up in you snow igloo
clockin the dollas goin all across the globe tourin 
all over the followers of doubters I'll be cold doin 
the diabolical infallible that's most cruel and
  
in come the fabulous ones make way for the fabulous ones x2
  
super fabulous the patterns have been updated 
wanna battle youll be baffled at the stuff stated 
drowning in the shallow waters of the rough raging 
verbal canoe with no paddle heading up state
i got a home made of chrome got an iron maiden
etchin poems in the stone with a wire cable 
im the lone wolf who dont condone violatin 
and when its on im leavin domes steady vibrating
in come the fabulos ones make way for the fabulous ones x2
i love waitin for rappers to arrive baked 
is my nature so smile now and die later
cause yall fakers is nothing but some cry babies 
that's why im writing out your citations
check it
im riding shottie doing gotti dirty work spiffy
in an impaly with a dolly and her skirts skimpy
the verbal scholly make you holla you get hurt simply 
cause the holocaust end all across the earths empty 
  
in come the fabulous ones make way for the fabulous ones x2
  
super fabulous the patterns have been upgraded 
triple stamina commando get your hut raided 
couldnt handle it you panicked and your luck faded 
keep on yappin out your trap and ima duck tape it
see we been doing this since you was in a wet diaper 
confusing as a rubix cube to the dense cipher
intuitive just like confusious in your next life
or a new addition of a ludricriuosly vexed sniper
pursuin moving units influence the next writers
student you ruin because you're truant before your test biter
bloomin and movin on in unison 
consuming the consumer 
and you and your crew'll be implented as 'west siders'
  
in come the fabulous ones make way for the fabulous ones x4
  
sample: welcome to a new kind of listening experience
