[Eve]
Uh, uh, uh, huh
Yo, yo
Drop your glasses, shake your asses
Face screwed up like you having hot flashes
Which one, pick one, this one, classic
Red from blonde, yeah bitch I'm drastic
Why this, why that, lips stop askin
Listen to me baby, relax and start passin
Expressway, hair back, weavin through the traffic
This one strong should be labelled as a hazard
Some of y'all niggas hot, sike I'm gassin
Clowns I spot em and I can't stop laughin
Easy come, easy go, E-V gon' be lastin
Jealousy, let it go, results could be tragic
Some of y'all ain't writin well, too concerned with fashion
None of you aint Giselle, cat walk and imagine
A lot of y'all Hollywood, drama, casted
Cut bitch, camera off, real shit, blast it

[CHORUS: Gwen Stefani]
I knew I had to give you more, it's only been a year 
Now I got my foot through the door, and I ain't goin nowhere
It took a while to get me in, and I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear, now let me blow ya mind

[Eve]
They wanna bank up, crank up, makes me dizzy(?)
Shank up, haters wanna come after me
You aint a gangster, prankster, too much to eat
Snakes in my path wanna smile up at me

Now while you grittin your teeth
Frustration baby you got to breathe
Take a lot more than you to get rid of me
You see I do what they can't do, I just do me
Aint no stress when it comes to stage, get what you see
Meet me in the lab, pen and pad, don't believe
Huh, sixteens mine, create my own lines
Love for my wordplay that's hard to find
Sophomore, I aint scared, one of a kind
All I do is contemplate ways to make your fans mine
Eyes bloodshot, stressin, chills up your spine
Huh, sick to your stomach wishin I wrote your rhymes

CHORUS

[Eve]
Let your bones crack
Your back pop, I can't stop
Excitement, glock shots from your stash box
Fuck it, thugged out, I respect the cash route
Locked down, blastin, sets while I mash out
Yeah nigga, mash out, D-R-E
Back track, think back, E-V-E
Do you like that (ooooh), you got to I know you
Had you in a trance first glance from the floor too
Don't believe I'll show you, take you with me
Turn you on, pension gone, give you relief
Put your trust in a bomb when you listen to me
Damn she much thinner know now I'm complete
Still stallion, brick house, pile it on
Ryde or Die bitch, double R, came strong
Beware, cause I crush anything I land on
Me here, ain't no mistake nigga it was planned on
