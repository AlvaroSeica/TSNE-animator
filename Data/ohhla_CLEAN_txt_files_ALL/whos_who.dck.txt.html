[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
I'm ready, I was born ready
I stay ready, You get me
Wu-Tang

[Hook: Inspectah Deck]
I'm back, Nothin new in this bitch
We all know who's who in this bitch
Black gloves and I duel the grips
Hell yeah still Wu in this bitch

[Inspectah Deck]
Bare witness, Some say he was past his prime
I had to laugh, I aint even at half time
But, Let me tell it I'm ahead of the game
So far from the rest of the lames
Little man I'll spit in your face
Eat your food then lick your plate
But you aint even worth the case
You a local, Few niggas heard your name
But I'm a supa fly fearless Don
There's a reason why I'm here this long
Since the glory years are gone
It makes you love it when they hear this song
Make a nigga wanna blast the glock
You was ballin now pass the rock
I'm above the rim, The hood got love for him
Good shit get thugs to spin
This is clock work, When you cop my work
Pop pop pop goes your mind like laverse
I leave em buzzin like E
They puff a little somethin but they nothin like me
They wanna touch and strike me
I fold em all up like a couple white tees
It takes more then that
This is more then rap, If you call it that

[Hook]

[Outro: Inspectah Deck]
Yeah, I'm still havin fun with it
I'm run with it, I'm not goin nowhere
I'm still a problem, INS the rebel
Get familiar, The Rebelion
Resident Patient part 2 comin at you</pre>
