[Chorus]
Bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch
Shawty you ain actin right you need to pack ya shit
Talkn bout call Tyrone ya need to call Tiesha
No More Shoppin Sprees I'm Smokin Fy Reefa!
I say bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch
Shawty you ain actin right you need to pack ya shit
Talkn bout call Tyrone ya need to call Tiesha
No More Shoppin Sprees I'm Smokin Fy Reefa!

[Verse 1]
I'm Higher Than A Parachute
And A Pair Of Eagles
I Might Paralyze Ya I'm a Needa Paralegal
And I ain't fantasizing when I mingle with the women
I'll take you and her now I got a pair of singles
Then I cut em up
Like a pair of scissors
Hit em with dat batman and hang from the ceiling
Suicide doors, hang from the Bentley
Nobody had to die but I made me a killin
Big Wheel Whippin
Bitch Still Chillin
What more can I say
I'm Dealin
Get Dough With Dilllan
Bitch Don't Act Right
I'm Puttin Her Out Of The Crib

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Baby this is Kush
And It Cost Me 600
I Know You Can't Afford It
You Just Got a Big Onion
And Ya Head FY
You a red girl
Shawty you a nut
Bitch I'm a Squirrel
Niggas Know Me
They Know My Pedigree
I'm a Big Dawg you Better Flea
No More Shoppin Sprees
To and From Miami
And Without Me You Can't Even Get In Club Miami
I DOUBT IT
My WHole Crew Bout It
Hotel Room You See My Chain from The Lobby
Charm So Heavy Like My Muh Fuggn Wallet
Talk Shit And My Car Pull The Bitch Out IT
Tell The Bitch AUDI</pre>
