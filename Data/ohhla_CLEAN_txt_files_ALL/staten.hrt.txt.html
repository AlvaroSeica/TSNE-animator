[Hook: Fes Taylor (Mr. Prezident)]
S-T-A-T-E-N I-S-L-E (yeah them boys is back
Yup, them S.I. boys is back, let's go

[Chorus: Mr. Prezident (Fes Taylor)]
Fresh off the boat like the city and subs
The fifth borough, you forget about us? (It's Staten Island)
So, this time we ain't giving a fuck
How the fuck, you forget about us? (It's Staten Island)

[Fes Taylor]
With a lean when it pop, when it dance on a nigga
Heart Foundation, advance like Jigga
Hammer on my hips, so my pants like bigger
They wanna be me, hoping my pants might fit ya
Fes taking pictures like a MySpace flick
Why these broke niggas fronting bout pies they get
Yeah, I bounce on the dicks, five state getting
Somewhere layed up, with a out of state bitch
We globetrotters, you a round the way rich
You starving, mouth white like powder round the lips
Like, Corona bottles with the crown around the tip
Til I'm King of New York, crowned royalships, yup
Prezzy my dude, been down for him six
Cashing the sticks, spit a couple rounds from the clip
How you forget, we started this shit
LIke Kid Rock, we ain't a part of this shit? You crazy

[Chorus 2X]

[Mr. Prezident]
You know how I rock homey, forty cal glock on me
Bulletproof coupe, niggas tried to pull a cock on me
Try and plot on me, take all my rocks off me
Let the bullets burn ya face like hot coffee
You pussy, you walk the block softly
Your boy need some elbow room, so back off me
Money feed good, I'm all in, ballin'
First nigga front, and he'll be sleeping with the dolphins
You bust gats, we love that, we bust back
Hit you in the chest, make you look like you hunchback
From the Stat, like 'fuck that'
Niggas got a spot that belong to us, that we want back
Got a problem come and see me in the dump
Put it straight to ya face like a 3D picture
Slaughterhouse PJ's, you know when we pop up
Try and drop ya ass, like you fell from the top, buff

[Chorus]
