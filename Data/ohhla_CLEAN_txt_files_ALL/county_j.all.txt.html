(Verse 1 -Squeak Ru)
In the county jail I'm straight  catchin hell
Facin strikin 3, goin crazy in my jail cell
Goddamn, I'm thinkin thru
They tryna hit me 25 for some shit that I didn't do
Servin time is my punishment
So I'm commin wit [them all ?], tryna prove that I'm innocent
Fuck the public defender, he ain't down wit me 
So I know I can't surrender
They rather drive me [well ?]
Not cases I'm facin while I sit in trial
And criminal defision, is Squeak Ru convicted that's the decision
The I heard the slam a [???] for
Now I'm back to the [holding tank ?], mad cuz I'm careful
This ain't no fairytale, you see life ain't shit in the county jail

Chorus:
Sittin in the county, [doesn't ?] like a party
Sittin in the county, [doesn't ?] like a party
Sittin in the county, [doesn't ?] like a party
Sittin in the county, you know everybody

(Verse 2 -Squeak Ru)
Loadin up on the bus
Gots watch my back cuz I don't wanna get rushed
I got one hand free, I'm lookin for the comrads
But all I see is enemies
I don't make sense, they got me cuffed to a muthafucker that I gang-bang against
Ey, nigga, where you from?
Soon as the gates wreck, you know I'm takin one
Lay ya flat on ya back, you don't wanna scrap
In fact, I'm perfect at combat
Now I'm lead as a bitch
Got a 90-500 and they gave me fish kit
And you best believe this: the brothers is strong
But the S-A's the deepest
This shit is hardco'
Crips and Bloods throwin up their set in them [???]
Wit the classification 
OSS wanna know my gang affiliation
But that shit's expected, ey, nigga, ain't you connected?
You goddamn right cuz in the county jail 
Only hards die for their stripes

Chorus

(Verse 3 -Squeak Ru)
I got a visit but it's drama
My girl and a hoe are fightin wit my baby momma
Now time to explain who I love the most
I gotta catch the chain
Quick to check a trustee
Cuz some of them fools be tryna playin deputy
Nigga, you'se a hook
I'm rollin wit them crooks 
And we don't like your flat books
I'm tired to bein a victim
It seems everytime I look I'm gettin punked by the system
It's hard bein a black men
So niggas wake up, you gotta have a [???]
Cuz they stretch you out
No matter if you're coppin in the West or servin in the south
It's a livin hell
You see, life ain't shit, so fuck the county jail
