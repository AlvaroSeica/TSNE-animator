[Intro/Chorus 2X: Random]
You-you-you ever have an urge that you couldn't fight?
That-that-that deep down inside somethin isn't right
Well-well-well I get that feelin each and everyday
Don't know what to do, and don't know what to say

[Random]
Aiyyo bro, I feel ya, your story's familiar
Trying to do right while folks tryin to kill ya
This path isn't easily walked
Though I know what I believe in my heart
I got a mission to complete
Part of that is not envisioning defeat
So feel what I be spittin on this beat
We go back La-Z-Boyz, since the 80's boys
Y'know, makin crazy noise, and
when you tried to get me, I understood
I just wanted you to come to good
And then it flashed like a photo, put me on lean
Sorta somethin like a cholo, oh no, not my brother Proto
'Til it's time to go though, you still my bro
And I hope that you hear this, you feel this yo
So I need you to fight the urge, ignite the surge
Cause it'll kill me to kill my bro, y'know?
Ya know?

[Chorus]

[Random]
Wily's robots goin off; I ain't havin it
I was about to go off to battle wit
Rush by my side like always
Had a feelin in my gut that somethin wasn't kosher like all day
Chalked it up to somethin I musta ate
Then all of a sudden Dr. Wily comes in the place
and he's askin for help, sayin his ship was smashed
The robots took his stuff, straight dipped and dashed
But then he said that he was buildin a cure
to the disease that had brought Robot City to its knees
I wasn't down but then the Doctor pleads
and gets into that position, y'know, on his knees
I told him get up, and we agreed to help
But Doc Light says I can't do this one myself
And just then I hear a whistle and a yellow scarf
Felt a lump in my throat, and a heavy heart
Cause when I see my bro-ther
I don't know whether to stretch my arms or charge the buster
Roll runs for cover, I stand my ground
And he says I'm hear to help bro, I'ma hold you down
Not sure if I can trust him but my choices are minimal
Sheisty individual, or this career criminal
Proto I'm not kidding you, look at me wrong
then I might have to put your circuits on the wall
Just keepin it real, bro
