[Intro: The Manhattans sample]
"It's two A.M., the place is gonna close
 The bartender looks, as though he knows
 Everybody's, everybody's been home
 Here we sit-"

{Freddie Gibbs adlibs over Intro}
Yeah, time to shut it on down, baby
Sure you wanna do this shit tonight? Cause it might hurt, baby
Might hurt you when I, get up in the morning and leave, ya know?
Take that walk, yanahmean?
Yeah, yeah...

[Freddie Gibbs]
Slammin, when I hit you up I'm talkin 'bout bangin somethin
Chill off in yo' crib and have a thzng, probably make it stank or somethin
Girl you like my bottom bitch, post my bail, pay for my lawyer
Play yo' position when them other hoes get out of order
When you wanna give me that pussy, you purchase a plane ticket
Word 'round town, when I bust 'er down they want shit like them lames did it
Got her dick-whipped, my dick smeared with lipstick
Basically if this bitch lay with me she payin me, I'm on some pimp shit
F'real~! It's 2 A.M. club was 'bout to close up
Thumbin thru my contacts, 'bout to call one of my hoes up
Then I met you, kicked game and followed you to the breakfast spot
Fuck you like I married you that night up in the Marriot
Scream like you got yo' cherry popped, fuckin, switchin up positions
Thought this shit would never stop, motherfuck an intermission - damn!
("Here we are, agaaaaaaain"...) Here we go agin, baby
Gotta take that walk now, take that walk boo

[Chorus: BJ the Chicago Kid]
It ain't got to be the walk of shame, baby
But that's only if you know the game, baby
Later I can't be the one to blame, baby
But for now take the walk of shame, baby
It ain't got to be the walk of shame, baby
But that's only if you know the game, baby
Later I can't be the one to blame, baby
But for now take the walk of shame, baby

[Freddie Gibbs]
Walk away with ya head up, yanahmsayin?

Straight slammin, sleepin with pistols under my pillow
We wake and bake, she up naked twistin up cigarillos
I beat that Thursday night and Friday morning, off to work she go
Time to take that walk, just take this dick, don't take it personal
Your friends prol'ly gon' call you a hoe, whatchu trippin on?
Them bitches want a grip from the same dick you be sittin on
And yo' girl Monique, she be hittin me when her nigga gone
Tryna buy some weed, she proceed with nothin but Vicki's on
Nothin but ass and titties, but I let that ass convince me
Took 'er in and hit that, wish I could say it was accidentally
Like I slipped on a banana peel and fell in that pussy
Y'all niggaz be spendin all kind of scril' to get in that pussy
And she cop a seven every Friday
Chuck the deuces at her baby daddy as I pulled up out the drive-way, f'real!
("Here we are, agaaaaaaain"...) 
Here we go again, back in yo' pussy, nigga, yanahmsayin?
Fa sho...

[Chorus]

("Here we are, agaaaaaaain"...) </pre>
