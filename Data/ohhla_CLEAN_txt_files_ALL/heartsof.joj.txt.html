[Intro: Carlton Fisk]
I feel you too motherfucker, I know, it's love
This nigga JoJo, this nigga's something else
Carlton Fisk, PLO is back, nigga
You thought it was gone, but it ain't, it never went nowhere
And I'm here, mister I'm here, Carlton Fisk in your area

[Carlton Fisk]
Description, light skinned male
International agencies can never put my face on foul
Mercenery, your favorite murder weapon was bomb symtec
The pros coming to New York, we thinking you're next
Master of disguise, FBI filled you with lies
?Carla Ferguson? youth was a diversion
Techniques to murder a surgeon, merging words
Blurred and disturbing, they lost me on nine five swerving
?Cowasaki? pushing this shit, sitting backwards, uzi clips dispersing
Helicopter almost had me stop traffic, merging
Pop the clutch, pop a shot, wheelie out, don't give a fuck, I'm never giving up
Plan to kill Pope John at one of his speeches
A killer with a conscience, children my only weakness
That shit sounds slick, but let's be for real
You's a faggot like nigga, you just caught a break
I'm the robbery suspect that'll tuck the eighth
Pistol whip you in the face, make you crack the safe
Let you front all you want on cds and mixtapes
Cus PLO Style, niggas had to earn they name
Getting close range on niggas and burn they frame
Learn the game, make a double wager, nod at your dame
Gave her a gram, fair exchange, head in your range
Curly head nigga, iceberg sweats the chain
Beef and brocoli, three quarter general's daughter
I'm out of order, my lifestyle's a crime reporter
Not the actor but the author, original clever terror
Rock a black leather, duck the police, blast berettas

[Chorus: Carlton Fisk (JoJo Pellegrino)]
(What evil lerks in the hearts of men)
It be the street life, PLO is at it again
What evil lurks in the hearts of men
(It be the sniper on the rooftop I'm at it again)

[JoJo Pellegrino]
Hitman for hire, off your foes with the fire
One single blow from the sniper and they gon tumble like clothes in the dryer
I'm self employed, be out of town for days
Check into hotels under alias names, search the clostets and close all the shades
Before I do a hit I get a clean shave
Slip on the leather gloves, throw on shades
Locate my target, set up shop in the shade
First class shotti was laid, his peoples looked back
Warent commission couldn't calculate the angle from witch his shit was pushed back
The cross hairs is non discriminating
And fifty thousand is the payment on the pavement, hot ones is penetrating
Live alone, anti-sociable, my work is my passion
Johnny Cash fashion, black armor, full gear matching
Sit with mob bosses, skippers and captains
I sail with only two things, see em before my envelope's passed in
Harder than Napoleon, politicions get popped at the podium
Wise guys probably gotta get close to em to dispose of them
Trips to Vancouver, sip the San Booker beneath the moonlight
Overlook grassy meadows rendevu with city night life
Then it's back to my trife life, clippin and wackin
Off in the scorcher, weapon of choice with infra red action
In the head, catch him, my scope in it's prime
On par recieving this particular charge, I specifically told him open his mind
Ruthlessly living, accept this dirty task that I'm giving
Hay listen, it's a living, my only weakness, women and children, hitman for hire

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
