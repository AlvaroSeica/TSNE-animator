Song:   Immortal
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

If I poured my heart out, would you leave it on the floor
Or would you pick it up and place it in your chest for me?

[Intro]
Everyone wants to live forever, at least to be remembered forever
We mere mortals are vain enough to want everyone to know our name, to hear our songs, to be immortal

[Verse 1]
I need, a penny for your thoughts and a nickel for your kiss
Would you fight for me?
You already know what I'm about
Would you pick up the pen and write for me
Would you spray me, like a disease sneeze me
Alright genetically freeze me, loving me is easy
Would yah? Could yah? Keep me as a keepsake
Hand me down, my sound, as freeloaders and cheap-skapes

I think very deeply
Believe me, Kali Baby, baby
Rivals they repeat me
Keep singing my name
And spread me in the streets
And graffiti me, reheat me
Serve me up as if I was a leftover
Stepped over me, repeatedly
Tech blown up now you seeing me
Pass me on like it's your turn
To hit me in the rotation
Then I wanna blow up today
Cus I'm gonna blow up the world today
And look at what we facin'
Everyone should say the same shit, ape shit, lucky we tape it
Download it, hold it, you love Strange Music never replace it

[Chorus]
If I poured my heart out would you leave it on the floor
Or would you pick it up and place it in your chest for me? (So I can be immortal)
And when you play my song, would you just pass it along
Continue to love me even when I'm gone? (So I can be immortal)

[Verse 2]
We taking over, we taking off, like a helicopter
We gettin' hella props from a billboard placement
Hollywood niggas don't know what to do with us
They changing us to ruin us and my life's wasted

If you see the path I'm on, then pass me along, I have (gone)
Just for a season I'm leaving now how could you sleep wit 'em
He's destined to get you in the best thing since mescalin
Success that's a sin
Well all the breathe in his chest has ended
Then you know the best ascended, depended
On nobody playin' with nobody
Hes nobody? Yea well alrighty
At my solo shows, I'm throwin' Bolos
And cholo hoes, letting 'em know how this mo'fo goes

See I'm an entity, playing on my infantry, since my infancy
And I'm coming to get that, coming to get what's good for me
Coming to shake your hand, and take your fans
Doing it with no advance, and still make grands
If my remains are servin' out of peoples arenas
And I was sellin' out, he'd find something to yell about
Crazy's that way, I'm thinking I might just go
I seem to be having an identity crisis

[Chorus]
If I poured my heart out would you leave it on the floor
Or would you pick it up and place it in your chest for me? (So I can be immortal)
And when you play my song, would you just pass it along
Continue to love me even when I'm gone? (So I can be immortal)

[Outro]
Immortal, I made it
And everyone gets to hear my stories
Kali, baby</pre>
