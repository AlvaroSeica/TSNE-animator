Only 2 1/2 years but a lifetime of memories
The moment I heard you were gone I broke down crying on my knees saying Lord please
Take me instead cuz I feel like I'm already dead
My methods ahuevo de smoke that's why the future will roll in his head
Man getting a little choked up just rubbing about it
Los hombres no lloran for shit homeboy quit rubbing about it
I reminice about back in the day we use to play before we lift weights
But I also remember the scuffles we had in pulling the plane this way
Hearing you say to this day "Hey perro come over so we can lift weights"
And getting a hyna and getting first dates
And I embrace finally grasping hard to reality cuz I hate living a fantasy
Realizing that not really here I said to myself that it cannot be
It cannot be that you're not really here
It cannot be it cannot be that you're not really here
It cannot be it cannot be that you're not really here
It cannot be it cannot be that you're not really here
You're not really here

Chorus: 2x
I reminice about back in the days carnal
We use to kick it in the playground and lift weights carnal
I wonder why you had to leave my side
Your memories on my mind everyday and every night
All of the time

You're probably wondering why I didn't show up to the funeral
I bet it was beautiful carnal did it hurt just to look at you
Laying there in the coffin on your back just in black cuz I couldn't understand the fact
That you had to pass and couldn't get a chance
To live a holy life
Always did something right our couple of days were tight
Thanks for everything expressing my gratitude with tears trickling
Down my face cuz I went out with praise is this a bunch of no maze?
But in the end of my days thinking of ways
I'd rather get by or leave myself a place so I must get high
Why is it so many questions to solve?
Not enough answers so it's easy to call I don't worry it all
I'll be your help when I fall when I feel pretty sure with your pictures on my wall
Now I lay me down to sleep dream my soul for the Lord to keep
And if you ever see me sleep anything close to a week
Now I want to let you know that I truly rest in peace

Yeah was sup. This song is dedicated to my homie Gabriel 
who passed away on Mother's Day. And is dedicated to his familia 
and everyone who's lost someone out there. Rest in Peace. I know 
you're looking down on me homie. And I know it. Rest in peace. 
Gracias Por everything homie. I'll miss you. Al rato

Chorus

It's hard homie putting these words in a song cuz now you're gone
And I'm all alone suicidal thoughts just rolling through my dome
I'm sorry ese if it seems like my voice is getting eerie
But every night I think about that day I get a little teary
Si supieras lo que hicistes dejastes a tus padres bien triste no es un chiste
Es algo serio caiste al cemeterio
De los 17 años  nomas por un paño
Y el varrio que queries tanto como les canto
Esta historia sin estar llorando?
Cuando ando solo en mi carro me acuerdo en esos tiempos desmadrosos
Dos mocosos jugandole los pozos
De las calles we were whooped we went out to the valles
Looking for enemigas listos para ser desmadres was an everyday thing
And until that night when I heard the phone ring at about 2:00 in the morning
My jefita gave me the bad news and my tears just started pouring, pouring

This is for all my homies that passed away. Descansa en paz.</pre>
