[IntrO: Rapper Big Pooh] (Ms. Cris)
Wh-where you goin? (I'm goin out)
I mean.. I mean, I went at got these Redbox
(WHAT??) I mean, I-I got popcorn

[Chorus: Rapper Big Pooh] (Pooh + Ms. Cris)
You're all that I need and I'm there for you
If you keep it real with me then there's nothing I won't do
I'm tryna put you on but you have no clue
Hopin this is making sense to you, I'm just sayin
 I'm tryna put you on, I'm tryna put you on
 I'm tryna put you on, I'm tryna put you on
 I'm tryna put you on but you have no clue
 Hopin this is making sense to you, I'm just sayin

[Rapper Big Pooh]
I'm thinkin we together, right? So there's really no reason 
for you to wanna hit the streets, I'm talkin every night
I could pick a fight, or I can sit and pout
I'd rather us converse, and try to figure out

[Ms. Cris]
What you mean? I just wanna have fun
Besides a girl young, you a bit too serious
You talkin like I'm in the club all curious
Checkin other niggaz while you waitin at home
Better learn to mean enough a little space or I'm gone

[Rapper Big Pooh]
I can tell I touched a nerve, pay attention to your tone
I wanna be a couple, I'm really tryna trust you
In order for this to work, there's some changin that you must do

[Ms. Cris] (Big Pooh)
Me change? Take a look in the mirror, boo
I know you thinkin that you're perfect (Nah, that ain't true)
Point is, there's some things you need to change too
Like right now, cause it's time to cunniling', dude

[Chorus]</pre>
