[Timbaland]
I don't wanna talk now, I don't wanna hear you scream no mo'
Won't somebody save me? Everything I do feel like it's wrong
All we do is fall down even though we try to stay afloat
I swear it's gon' kill me even though you think it won't
So why rock a boat and make waves?
When everything's calm and okay
So why am I confused if you love me?
I thought this would be smooth sailing

[Chorus: The Fray]
Cause I don't wanna let you go
and we're caught in the undertow
Cause I am losin my control
And we're caught in the undertow
Our only prayer, is all our own
but we need air, we go alone
cause I don't wanna let you go
but we're caught in the undertow

[Esthero]
I don't wanna cry, every time we try it never fails
We change the illusion, whenever you go and set the sail
My heart's in your hand, don't you go hurt me agai-ain
All we got is one chance and it's sink or swi-im
So why rock a boat and make waves? (Make waves!)
When everything's calm and okay? (I'm okay!)
Why am I confused if you love me? (Love me!)
Thought this would be smooth sailing

[Chorus] w/ Esthero

[all together]
And the water's rising {*4X*}

[Chorus] - first half repeats twice w/ ad libs

[The Fray &amp; Esthero]
Our only prayer, is all our own
We both need air, we go alone
Our only prayer, is on our own
We both need air, we go alone
Cause I don't wanna let you go
I don't wanna let you go
Cause we're caught in the under...
