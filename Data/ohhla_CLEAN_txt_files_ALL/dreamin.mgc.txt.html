Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I'm tired of dreamin'
I'm tired of hoping
So tired of hoping
I need you to love me
Baby wont you love me
My heart is wide open
Heart is wide open

I got a bad mamcita wide open like a wide receiver
waiting for me on the house when I come home from santa rita
And I met her through a letter sent a picture to see her
My lil homie hooked me up with his fine ass tia
Said she liken this thang superstar like Selena
Beautiful face looked like jlo from the rear
Call her azucar, she's sweet as cherry pie
Every night I tell her suga suga tell me how you get so fly
And I can't lie, I'm happy I met her
Everyday anticipation building up with a letter
I'm working out, getting strong, dirty talkin on the phone
one more day and I'll be home

I'm tired of dreamin'
I'm tired of hoping
So tired of hoping
I need you to love me
Baby wont you love me
My heart is wide open
Heart is wide open

C'mon
Now I been out on the road doing what I do
Chasin' this bread but I'm doing it for you
I wanna keep you fly in that fresh x5
Your heart is wide open and I'm coming inside
I know we been through it like a million times
But I love it when you say that you're loosing your mind
And making plans for a dinner date, new hand bag
And imam do whatever when I come right back
Fire and desire, that's what I need
Do it so good it's gon' feel like a dream
I know you're tired and miss me too
I can't wait to be next to you

I'm tired of dreamin'
I'm tired of hoping
So tired of hoping
I need you to love me
Baby wont you love me
My heart is wide open
Heart is wide open</pre>
