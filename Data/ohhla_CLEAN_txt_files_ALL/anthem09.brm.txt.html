[Intro: Busta]
It's too late to turn back now nigga, now nigga
Get your money, get your money  Busta Bust
Get your money, get your money  Ty Fyffe
Get your money, get your money
Ay I'm 'bout to activate a Wonder Twin power on they ass
Get your money, get your money  T-Pain get 'em! (yeah)

[Chorus: T-Pain]
You should already know when I walk in the do'
that it ain't no use in frontin on me (frontin on me)
I'm a hustle, I'ma do my thang
You already know what it's gon' be (what it's gon' be)
I keep hustlin (yeah) I keep hustlin (yeah)
I keep hustlin (yeah) I keep hustlin (yeah)
And if you feel me put your hands up

[Busta Rhymes]
Check, okay LET'S GO!
What it do, what it do all day
Come through and get it jumpin, throwin money away
It don't matter if you're hustlin a bundle of yay
Or you got a 9-to-5, let the champagne spray
Veuve Clic', a little Dom or Jouët Rosé
Two chicks on my arm when I step, okay
Gillette razor sharp, you know the boy don't play
D.C. ten drop me down to Saint-Tropez, yay
Let the money machine roll on
We been needin a nigga like you in the streets so long
E'ry time I drop see I can never do no wrong
I'll progress, you and your little crew prolong, gone!
You hater niggaz, I know your forte (uh-huh)
We blind your little shine, fuck what you portray
While you wanna leave I know your little chick wan' stay
And if you violate see I'll make sure you ALL gon' pay, hey!

[Chorus] w/ Busta ad libs

[Busta Rhymes]
Hey world, the god's back in town (uh-huh)
You ain't gon' wanna miss it when the shit go down (uh-uh)
We celebratin like we throwin money around (uh-huh)
Bring a lot of 'trón, I'm 'bout to order a couple of rounds
Look, I know at times it probably seem like the hardest
when you ain't got it, but you gotta go and get it regardless
Check it, get on your hustle homie  get up and go
And do it proper for them  federal notes
And go and cop a island; and do a lot so I could - stack up a row
With a couple billion with a  stash and a flow
Up in the mansion, listen
I'm only tellin you the theme of this caper
is get your money nigga, stack up your paper
Let's keep it goin, ohh!

[Chorus] w/ Busta ad libs

[Busta Rhymes]
Peep the way the kid be bangin 'em random (uh-huh)
And the way the bitches spaz the way they throwin a tantrum (uh-huh)
Tryin to hustle, cop a plane, a couple ships nigga and some
You hustle up on the block, some niggaz hustle a ransom
NOW  but as long as you can go and mustle a grip
Whether you shinin from a grind or if you hustle legit
Either way get money nigga, turn on the switches
for power hustlin and stack all your riches
That's how we on it, yeah! (yeah)

[Chorus] w/ Busta ad libs

[T-Pain]
