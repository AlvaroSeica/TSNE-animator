[Intro: Yung Budd (Fat Tone)]
Where'd that mamacita that was just here? She left?
(Nah, she's still out, I think she's still out on stage, man)
I don't even want her to do nothing (me neither)
Yo, she's out, check it, I'll take it like this
We come back out, Fat Tone comes from nowhere
He flies off the ceiling, cuz he Batman
He could come fly off the ceiling (Batman flies right?)
You know? Yanahmean? And just take over the whole damn show
And everything is a rap, yanahmean? You brought ya mans
(That's right) Nahmean? (You could just stand on the side
cuz I'ma introduce my peoples: Hydro and Meta)
Matter of fact, let's have a little rehearsal
A little thing thing going on, check it...
I want y'all... lemme hear a little bit from y'all niggaz
and see what Fat Tone is... (you talk a lot and you bounce a lot)
You see this? (I know this is about ya album but)
This is about... (Can I not introduce these two?)
Go 'head, go 'head, and just lemme hear, lemme see...
(Aiyo Hydro right here, you can kick a little something for 'em)
Yeah, gimme, gimme a little (step up to the plate)
Come on Hydro (I'ma drop this beat, here it is)
You supposed to be Hydro, let's go (let it flow, here come the beat)

[Hydro]
Yo, I'm the grimy nigga and I do biz with grimy figures
Yo, I hopped out the 6 cuz I wanted something bigger
Ten million and one ways to kill a kid
and you ask a nigga how many ways the killa did
And I'm still here, pull a trigga, nigga, truth or dare?
You fuck around and have a silver bullet pierce ya ear

[Interlude: Fat Tone (Yung Budd)]
Oh, oh, back up, back up (I'm have both of that one)
I got one more, yo Meta, blaze that
Step up to that plate, Meta
Do ya thing, show Buddy Love what you all about {Meta: aight, yo]
(Deep voice kid)

[Meta Maestro]
Yo, yo, all my niggaz coming through with the durags hanging
Jump out the truck with the gats, we spraying
Run up in that castle, what the fuck is complex?
We got the hearse outside, nigga, ya casket's next

[Interlude: Yung Budd (Hydro)]
Oh, oh, oh (why you stopping? Why you stopped?
You not rid of that?) OK, OK, I'm feeling it, but

[Hydro]
I show Buddy no Love
cuz he don't like the way I bust the guns in the...

[Outro: Hydro (Yung Budd) {Fat Tone}]
Yo, I ain't even gonna do it (faggot)
(Let's just leave it like that)
{You know what, we just gonna flow with what we got}</pre>
