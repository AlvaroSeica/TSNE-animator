[Zack de la Rocha]
His spit...is worth more than her work...
Pass the purse to the pugilists...
A-he's a prize-fighter...
And he bought rings and he owns kin
And now he's swingin..
And now he's the champion....

[Chorus]
HEY REVOLVER, DON'T MOTHERS, MAKE GOOD FATHERS?
REVOLVER!
HEY REVOLVER, DON'T MOTHERS, MAKE GOOD FATHERS?
REVOLV-er!

A spotless domain...
Hides festering hopes, she's certain there's more
Pictures of fields without fences...
A spotless domain...
Hides festering hopes, she's certain there's more
Pictures of fields without fences...
Her body numbs as he approaches the door...
As he approaches the door...
As he approaches the door...
As he approaches the door...
As he approaches..

[Chorus]
HEY REVOLVER, DON'T MOTHERS, MAKE GOOD FATHERS?
REVOLVER!
HEY REVOLVER, DON'T MOTHERS, MAKE GOOD FATHERS?
REVOLVER!
HEY REVOLVER, DON'T MOTHERS, MAKE GOOD FATHERS?
REVOLVER!
HEY REVOLVER, DON'T MOTHERS, MAKE GOOD FATHERS?
REVOLVER!

[Instrumental break along with Tom Morello's creepy solo]

REVOLVER!
HEY REVOLVER, DON'T MOTHERS, MAKE GOOD FATHERS?
REVOLVER!
