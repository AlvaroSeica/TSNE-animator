Typed by: AZ Lyrics

And sometimes I don't, I don't feel good
Not physically but mentally, mentally
It's like I lose myself, like I'm not
Krizz anymore like
Unstable

It seems like I would've fixed it
But I've been gone for way too long
Put a band-aid on it to fix it
But I'll be barely hangin' on
If this is hell then I need help
So dark, it's like I never see the sun
It's like I'm dreamin' but feels so real
And I can't be the only one

Unstable! Give me a reason
'Cause I can't stop but thinkin' 'bout leavin
I'm so unstable! (unstable)
And I need help 'cause
I can't do it by myself

Unstable! Give me a reason
'Cause I can't stop but thinkin' 'bout leavin
I'm so unstable!
And I need God
By myself is just too hard
So unstable

Now I'm back on my coo-coo, medicine it's better than
Feelin' like I'd rather be in heaven if it never end
Even that is soon to a better room
Wish I could go back up in the room if there was any room
Unbirth me, this earth hurts me
Said I'm berserk, not a single person heard me
Up and down like workin' what I do when I'm worthy
If life's a beast then can we at least go surfin'?
My group was alone, under the umbrella soon, rains is the new soup
Pain got me jumpin' through these hoops
That's why I jump back in this booth
So when I figure it out I get it out
When I get rid of it so I gotta let it out
I'm still breathin' feelin' completely

Unstable! Give me a reason
'Cause I can't stop but thinkin' 'bout leavin
I'm so unstable! (unstable)
And I need help
I can't do it by myself

Unstable! Give me a reason
'Cause I can't stop but thinkin' 'bout leavin
I'm so unstable!
And I need God
'Cause by myself is just too hard
So unstable

Make it up out of it, battle it, take a hit, gotta get
Out of it before it gets malignant
I'm digging my own grave and being my own slave
I figure it's gon take a miracle one day
To get it up off me, it's killin' me softly
The feelin' is awfully like Jitterbug from coffee
Again this disorder, got me thinkin' it's over
Can we do this over [?]

Kali baby may be crazy
Since the day that you was born
But if he raised in 3 days maybe
He can get me through this storm

Unstable! Give me a reason
'Cause I can't stop but thinkin' 'bout leavin
I'm so unstable! (unstable)
And I need help
I can't do it by myself

Unstable! Give me a reason
'Cause I can't stop but thinkin' 'bout leavin
I'm so unstable!
And I need God
'Cause by myself is just too hard
So unstable, and I find myself lately reaching
Out to God, 'cause well, unstable</pre>
