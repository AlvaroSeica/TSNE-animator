Chillin at my house getting fucked up, making noise
Should I call a hoe, or should I call my boy?
Well I'ma call a dog bitch my niggaz told me 'bout
I'ma fuck her real good and make he work her mouth
And if she work real good I might decide to keep her
Stick it in her ass and fuck her with my streetsweeper
She was short, sorty cute with a big behind
I said bitch now let me do it with my fucking nine

[Chorus]
Lemmie stick my fucking 9 in ya hoe, lemmie stick my fucking 9 in ya hoe
Lemmie stick my fucking 9 in ya hoe, lemmie stick my fucking 9 in ya hoe
Lemmie stick my fucking 9 in ya hoe, lemmie stick my fucking 9 in ya hoe
Lemmie stick my fucking 9 in ya hoe, lemmie stick my fucking 9 in ya hoe

Lil Ya' is the type that don't give a shit
My three favorite words is doggina doggina doggina bitch
Like this bitch named Jawaun
I fucked her with my 9 
Because I know that I could make her mines
I got a bitch named Carrol
I fucked her in her ass with my sardoff double barrel
She enjoyed it ALOT
While I was fucking her with the barrel she was sucking the chrome off my glock
And what about Shandice?
I fucked her with my 22, you know she's a freak
I fucked her so hard she started crying
Uh-uh-uh whats next? Lemmie do her with my fucking 9

[Chorus]

Third ward posse if ya love to G
Your not tricking but ya fucking say U-N-L-V
To the fourth ward niggaz if ya love to G
Your not tricking but ya fucking say U-N-L-V
To the Devil ward posse if ya love to G
Your not tricking but ya fucking say U-N-L-V
To the ninth ward niggaz if ya love to G
Your not tricking but ya fucking say U-N-L-V
For the tenth ward posse if ya love to G
Your not tricking but ya fucking say U-N-L-V
To the twelfth ward niggaz if ya love to G
Your not tricking but ya fucking say U-N-L-V
To the Seventeenth posse if ya love to G
Your not tricking but ya fucking say U-N-L-V
