Verse 1: Usher

Before anything began between us
you were like my best friend!
The one I used to run and talk to,
when me and my girl was having problems!         (That's right!)
You used to say it'll be okay,
suggest little nice things I should do!
And when I go home at night
and lay my head down
all I seem to think about was you
and how...

Chorus: Usher

... you make me wanna leave the one I'm with,
start a new relationship with you,               (Ooh, yeah! Ooh, yeah!)
this is what you do!                             (Aah, yeah!)
Think about her and all the things
that come along with,                            (... come along with...)
you make me...                                   (You make me...)
You make me...                                   (You make me...)
leave the one I'm with,
start a new realtionship with you,               (Ooh, baby!)
this is what you do!
Think about her and all the things               (Come on, come on, come
on,...)
that come along with,                            (... come on, come on!)
you make me...
You make me...

Verse 2: Usher

Now what's bad
is you're the one that hooked us up!
Knowing it should've been you!
What's sad is that I love her,
but I'm falling for you!
What should I do?
Should I...
... tell my baby bye-bye?
Should I...
... do exactly what I feel inside?
Cause I...
... I don't wanna go,
don't need to stay,
but I really need to get it together!

Chorus: Usher

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with,        (UUH!)
start a new relationship with you,               (Ooh Baby!)
this is what you do!                             (See what you do?)
Think about her and all the things               (Ah, yeah!!!)
that come along with,
you make me...                                   (You make me...)
You make me...                                   (You make me...)
