[Hodgy Beats]
I said 2DopeBitches wanna diss on a blog
wen they can't see through this Odd Future smog
Odd Future Wolf, you a premature dog
I burn your whole website like it's a fuckin log, uh
I'm past dissin, and now I'm admittin you to
come to a show and, check out our performance
They feel us deep inside like a pains in the organs
We make it rain music when it rains it is pourin
Niggaz only holla at us when they want somethin
Fuck 'em all, no drawers, homey you get nothin
And you can label me the asshole, buttcrack
I ain't whack so I'm everything but crack
Tyler get it off my shoulder, dust that
All cause you spittin fiction, and we're just facts
Odd Future Wolf Gang bang bang
We on our Odd shit, you can't do the same thang

[Chorus]

[Hodgy Beats]
I have about, sixty minutes to ease you
I'm so sick, my contact would disease you
Kill 'em all I could lyrically decease you
Hold on to your earlobes as we release two
more tapes - a bunch of fun, more rape, corruption
Man we monster truck in the streets, sweet destruction
Odd Future Wolf's niggaz seein where you go
Addicting babies in bellies, chasin at the Juno
Why you hating on us cuatro, we numero uno
On top of y'all, on top of all; we the shit, rock the stars
Fuck the rules, boxer brawl, make sure we pack 'em tight
We get haters confused, like hermaphrodites
Half man, half a dyke, I'm half dead, half a-alife
Cracked hands, flash the light, put 'em in the air
Put 'em in the air, nigga put 'em in the air
Rep O.F. like you just don't care

[Outro]
That's my (team)
Wolf Gang that's my (team)
