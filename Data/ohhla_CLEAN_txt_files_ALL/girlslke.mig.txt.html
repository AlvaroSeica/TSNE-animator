Song:   Girls Like
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus:]
Girls like you remind me that I'm lonely, yeah
Remind me that I'm lonely
No one to play Connect 4 with me
I declare war with me
Knocked out and snore
From rolling around in my bed

Someone, anyone to listen
I feel like I'm missing the real thing
Tell me where I go
What I got a few
I can always call when I'm ready
But I feel like I'm wasting my time, yeah

'Cause my heart beats are empty
So once in awhile, I remember

[Chorus]

I don't wanna think, I just wanna drink
'Cause I'm overcomed by this notion
Don't you know I'm real, baby can't you tell
But you got a hole in your heart
And I probably would dismiss it
The truth that I miss you for real
Hook-ups are through,
'Til I see a girl like you

'Cause my heart beats are empty
So once in awhile, I remember

[Chorus]

Beautiful girls
Intelligent girls
Collate girls

I hate you (yeah, I hate you)
But the truth is I want you
And I need you
What's the very best way to reach you
I research you
'Cause I'm looking for something real

[Chorus]</pre>
