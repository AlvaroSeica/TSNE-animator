[Verse 1 - Lil B]
Take her to a place she aint gotta know me, see I love b coke
everybody o.d., bangcadlang yeah I'm off on the free
watchin booty bounce bop in the club wanna see?try me imma street thugg
lil b get money everyday, so much, four blunts
make the bay go nuts, and I'm yellin out boss everytime I roll up
shoot for the stars and the way look milky, and the colipark beat bounce like a slinky
spit crack, cool with a whip, girl get loose when you in the spaceship
uh said she like my rap pattern and, she want a ring like the one around saturn and
no wheels no air where we travelin, when we in the backseat please no chatterin

[Chorus]
she aint never been to space before
She aint never been to space before
She aint never been to space before
I'll take her, I'll take her
You'll be ridin down the milky way
You'll be ridin down the milky way
You'll be ridin down the milky way
You'll be ridin down the milky way

[Verse 2 - Stunnaman]
Spaceship, spaceship, hell yea hoppin
Stunnaman, stunnaman, yea I get it poppin
You ever been to space? imma take you there
Don't worry bout your phone it aint workin up here
And I'm like pluto, yea I spit cool bars
I go hard on mars, neck grindin on stars
Wanna come to my world? baby pop this pill
And she like how that feel

[Uno]
A cute lil chick but her whip too basic, I'm a star girl I ride spaceships
All you need is a fly young man
No wings, no plane, we can go anywhere
Your complexion it tastes like chocolate, and the newgit it taste like rocket
She roll wit freak mcnasty, I make her nasty
And she told me

[Chorus]

[Stunnaman]
You ever been to Mercury?

You ever been to Venus?

You ever been to mars?

You ever been to Jupiter?

You ever been to Saturn?

You ever been to Neptune?

You ever been to Pluto?
