[Intro]
So recognize that shit~!
You better fuck recognize that fuckin name right now
ASAP, recognize that shit ASAP
A-fuckin-SAP, you don't put no fuckin fear in my heart!

[ASAP Rocky]
These other niggaz so-so, they open off my mojo
Spanish Sophie with a half a kilo by her cho-cho
Blow it out your culo, who got dough on the smoke though?
My partner had cinco now we blowin on that ocho
Bozos love my rose gold, purple got me slow-mo
Stuntin like I'm Dorothy but my rubies in my dough though
What you think this four for? These niggaz must be loco
Steppin on these bricks and for your fix so call me Toto
Follow me, follow me, follow me now

[ASAP - voice deepened]
Follow me now, and my goons gettin down
Got a new Cadillac, with a diamond in the back
Got a bitch, and she bad, with about a hundred tats
Got my goons on deck and we got a hundred straps
What'chu know about that? Got my swagger to the max
Everybody know I run this shit and baggage just to match
Uhh better come correct, fuckin what the bass-es is
Gold grills like a set of new braces-es

[ASAP Rocky]
Why they comment on my set though, they lookin cause my neck gold
And I let that Tec show, hah, hear that echo?
Let go, that medal, three-eight special, to yo' threshold
Niggaz actin petrol, like they sexual, was metro
A bunch of bad bitches, fuckin out on tour
Like it through the back door, give it to her raw
+Shimmy Shimmy Ya+ ODB, ODB
Fuckin other niggaz broads O.P.P., O.P.P.

[ASAP - voice deepened]
Comin'down stuntin like a bitch, bitches on my dick
On the set and they like the nicotine to cigarette
How they fiendin for a nigga got these hoes up on my set
Got my niggaz in the back, couple bitches in the bed
ASAP where it's at, where that weed, where that cake?
Bitches all up in my face, back back, give me space
Cause you know how we do it, niggaz scream ASAP
Aye Clams nigga, tell me where that bass at?

[Outro]
