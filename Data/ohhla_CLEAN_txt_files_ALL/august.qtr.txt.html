[Chorus]
come to town, you can
stay with me - we're from 
lake city

[Medium Zach]
southside to northeast 
where I work not reside got a ride to go cheap 
to pick up L's XL's popular sizes - 
cars bumper to bumper traffic surprising 
for 2:30 too early but two lanes closed 
fixing - man made living who knows
construction or something 
lack of comfort disgusting growing 
accustomed to roll with the punches been 
humid for weeks a beautiful scene leaving the 
house feel like a mouth no news of a breeze
my friend want my directions next exit
best bet  since this one out there ya catch it
stop light had our poster on it, almost saw it
used to live three blocks that way brandon was still in college
I just finished high school different process
beats were cool still weren't polished
worked area five years phone canvassing
polls on election wellstone's crashing in
afterschool programs made me passionate
fell in my lap didn't really ask for it
I've watched blocks turn into lofts
most want a good time no matter the cost
crowds get enormous cops stop party, party block traffic
riot gotta happen, when you in Minneapolis

[Chorus]
come to town, you can
stay with me - we're from 
lake city
come to town you can stay with me
big quarters we're from lake city
most jobs around here pay
get some air let it ventilate
big quarters from lake city
any day it can change quickly
this country guilty of neglect
I think it's time we collect

[Brandon Allday]
sliding like skittles to the palm of the deep
sun gone water warm from the calm of the sleep
to calculate degrees between me and them
watching 3 hours of CNN
my power knocked out before the word got out
my lady feeling like she need the whole world blocked out
spellbound flashing on the screen zoning from the tragedy
short step from phillips I mean ventura village
my mother called crying and we disconnected
I dialed earlier cingular a busy network
I heard everyone died in harry potter
right before they said 50 cars buried in the water
the terrorists got us and we eating enchiladas
attackers would've picked a target more prominent
5 parts split the way the lord wanted it
1000+ flicking the collapse
many still missing in the crash what else can we ask
watching mpd eat pizza hut delivery
lit like niagara flocking to the banks
people slept there before it was the media stage
that info not on the wikipedia page
this country guilty of neglect see the decay
bakery mask the smell of summer rot
some stories have morals and some do not

[Chorus]
come to town, you can
stay with me - we're from 
lake city
come to town you can stay with me
big quarters we're from lake city
most jobs around here pay
get some air let it ventilate
big quarters from lake city
any day it can change quickly
this country guilty of neglect
I think it's time we collect</pre>
