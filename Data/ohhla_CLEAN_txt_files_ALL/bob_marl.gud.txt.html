[Bridge]
I wanna love you
And treat you right
I wanna love you
And treat you right

[Verse 1]
I woke up early this morning zonin'
My girl twist up the herb we blowin
Call up my homies they comin through it
Two liter Sprite, the DJ Screw'n
Up in my cup this feel dub
Ice to the rim, is chilled up
Smoke in the air the purple dank
Is a mean combination with purple drink
That's why my speeches slur this way
Smoke to calm my nerves today
Burning on the interstate
Sip and switch and swerving lane
Tonight we bring the mollies out
Watch how they make the molly talk
Music loud, blowing loud, as the great Bob Marley talk

[Bridge]
I wanna love you
And treat you right
I wanna love you
And treat you right

[Chorus]
We'll be together
Every day and every night
I wanna love you
And treat you right

[Verse 2]
See streets I'm up in this bitch
I'm blowing like a pair of ties, I keep em rolling
She can't come with me if the haters golden
Neck, hands, wrist, ears is strictly frozen
Me and my niggas is mobbing out
We get high, we fry without a doubt
New Orleans the city where I'm from
Weed, money, pussy I'm getting some
Smoke-smoke until I pierce my lung streets
Streets AK, real as one
Pop the dutch, pop the clutch
Smoke and watch get the whip get gone
Styrofoam filled up, you know what I'm sipping on
Rest in peace to Bob Marley, we blowing that killer strong
Streets

[Bridge]
I wanna love you
And treat you right
I wanna love you
And treat you right

[Chorus]
We'll be together
Every day and every night
I wanna love you
And treat you right

[Verse 3]
Double GN streets in this bitch together
MOB nigga we ball whatever
Pass me my cup I'm in my zone
ET high, yup I'm phoning home
High out my mind I'm a rolling stone
Met the cup weed you smoking on
Swerving in the coop the toes is chrome
My passenger I'm poking on
Split the blunt up like a broken home
Pass it to streets you know I'm gone
Sixteen ounce sprite I pours on
Shout out B Marley, you know the song

[Bridge]
I wanna love you
And treat you right
I wanna love you
And treat you right

[Chorus]
We'll be together
Every day and every night
I wanna love you
And treat you right</pre>
