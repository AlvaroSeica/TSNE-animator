-Intro-(Chris) Bizzy-
(Yeah I'm so real, real, real, real)
Drivin' on the motherfuckin' freeway and shit, you know what I'm saying?
Seventy motherfuckin' miles per motherfuckin' hour
Y'know I'm a reach it up to seventy-five, this how we do it, baby
Boy, get much more motherfuckin' deeper
Man, this the motherfuckin' reaper is hangin' on your shoulders
I wanna give him a hug and tell him that I love him and I'm getting older
And life is gettin' colder but motherfucker's words is getting bolder

[Bizzy Bone]
While I'm walkin' in the trenches of Cali
I'm feelin' these motherfuckers wanna see me all fucked up in an alley
They wanna see me with no money, they really wanna see me hungry
But of course I'm gonna clean myself, I'm feeling lovely
As they walking through The Matrix, don't even say it
Homeless ain't homeless nigga, they ain't boneless
And don't play it, ain't no hatred
Motherfuckers don't even know, don't even say it
Give it back to these niggas, they don't need no knowledge
Motherfuckers need to pay some homage
I ain't even trying to take your ass to the ghetto or spiritual college
Cause these motherfuckers don't know and leather squalers
I need a bomber so I can hang through the cold
so I can hang through the bold so I can hang with the old
Meaning the the ancients as they sitting over and watchin'
This is the way we do it, the time is tickin' and it's still clockin'

[Chorus-Chris] + (Bizzy)
To heal (I'm a real motherfucker till they kill me)
I'm a blaze the weed, hit the drink, baby, that's just me
(I'm a real motherfucker till they kill me)
Yeah I'm so real, real, real, real
To heal (I'm a real motherfucker till they kill me)
I'm a blaze the weed, hit the drink, baby, that's just me
(I'm a real motherfucker till they kill me)
Yeah I'm so real, real, real, real

[Bizzy Bone] + (Chris)
My battles, they be comin' in dreams
And motherfuckers don't know that I'm seein' through the seams
As I crease up the jeans and I buckle the belt
and I rock this motherfucker, it ain't for myself
Cause I rock this motherfucker, it ain't for my death
And I rock this motherfucker, it ain't for my health
Cause I'm a drink what I drink, I'm a smoke what I smoke
If I die from the liver cancer, bitch I choke
I'm a real motherfucker till they kill me (Yeah I'm so real, real, real, real)
Thou shall never kill, this is how they grill me
This is how they gon' feel me, this is how they are awaken
And this is that, that awoke, they say "BB you still smoking?"
Course I need some chronic in my system, motherfuckers won't even fuckin' listen
Gotta get 'em when you get 'em, you rid 'em when you rid 'em
If you listen then you listen if not what the fuck

[Chorus]
To heal (I'm a real motherfucker till they kill me)
I'm a blaze the weed, hit the drink, baby, that's just me
(I'm a real motherfucker till they kill me)
Yeah I'm so real, real, real, real
To heal (I'm a real motherfucker till they kill me)
I'm a blaze the weed, hit the drink, baby, that's just me
(I'm a real motherfucker till they kill me)
Yeah I'm so real, real, real, real

[Outro-Bizzy]
One time for they' motherfuckin' mind, most motherfuckin' definitely
Motherfuckers can't even come up in this motherfuckin' garden with no shit
flat out get the fuck outta here
World wanna know nothing, that's why God put 9 percent of the brain
Take out that cerebellum for me, man. They don't need to know nothing
One time for they mind; Be easy on them, Cuz</pre>
