I'm under the influence of, somethin worse than influenza
Got all the symptoms - sore throat, achy joints, clammy hands
Dry cough, fever, somebody call the ambulance
I'm up all night, tossin like a dryer load
Sweatin like I'm at a club that violated fire code
Crypto-sporid-e-o-sis
These days I'm too debilitated to focus
Hope this, blows over expeditiously
It's attackin me, viciously
I got people to save, but nobody to save me
Hope it ain't scabies or rabies, or maybe
its encephalytus, malaria
whatever it is its Robot City in a state of mass panic
Hysteria - vacate the area
Did I hear chicken pox as an adult can bury ya
Picture me bedidden just cause I'm feelin rotten
That's a quick way for a hero to be forgotten
Whoever was plottin on this scam was a genius
I'ma need Walgreens, Rite Aid and CVS
Could it be age related
Runnin and jumpin, evadin for years, the reflexes fadin
Shortness of of breath and my chest is infected
Maybe it's the dust of asbestos {*cough*}

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I don't know! I need a doctor right now
I'm sick! I need a doctor right now
I don't know! I need a doctor right now
to stop this right now, I got to fight now

Hypo-chondriac tryin to rap
with a heatin pad under my cap
I'm online readin some home remedy book
I can't believe a little virus is gettin me shook
Coughin, achin stuffy head fever, Protoman callin me a diva
Till I blew chunks on his suit, made a believer
out of him, lot of 'em infected as we are
Me and Roll checkin in the E.R.
Doc says, we are, unable to help you
All out the vaccine, take a number
Roll gets 99, I get a hundred
So much bad luck it's, makin me wonder
Gotta find Wily, figure out what he's up ta
Rush to the jet, then I'm headin to his structure
It pains me say it but I need his help
Roll's gettin worse, I can take care of myself
but that's family~!!

Things turned strange when I visit the Doctor
Not only was he not involved, he had a box of
the vaccine tucked away, up in a safe place
Said he would give it to us, once we laid waste
to the robot masters gone wild
Cause they been wreakin havoc for a while
This whole thing was perplexing
cause just last year he had Light on trial
Now I'm supposed to trust you man
He said "Mega Ran I know it's difficult to understand
but time's running out," on everything I cherish
I can't let Roll perish so I guess I gotta swallow grin and bear it
And I strap on the helmet, call me a Doubting Thomas but
can I believe him, cause everything he promised was a lie
I do it anyway disgusted
Deep down believin Dr. Wily can't be trusted
but man!
