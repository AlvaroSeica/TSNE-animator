Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[J.D.] Y'all know what this is!

[Chorus]
Only thing that keeps me up, when I'm feelin down
I don't know about you, but I gotta keep mines around
Cause I done looked, I done searched, and it's hard to find
another shortie like mine, baby yes I'm
addicted to how we kick it, everything you say to me
Never knew it could be so wicked, hopin that you stay wit me
search around the world but you will never find
another shortie like mine, shortie like mine

[Hook]
I tell my {niggaz} that uh you got a girl but she ain't nothin' like (mineeee)
Cute face nice size like (mineee)
Stay kitted hood wit like (mineee)
mean walk talk Chris help me tell 'em what's up

[Verse 1]
I knew when I ran into this one she would be the redrum of my pimpin
Knew she would be the one to make me stop
caring about other girls on my jock and gettin them
She was the one to slow me down hold me down
I roll wit her know go wit it now I'ma grow wit it
Now I'ma go get her that's how I got her
Don't be mad you can't get one hotta 
Boke them up when they made lil' momma
I don't care what my {niggaz} say she been there everyday for my drama
Some of the homies hate cause they want her
Wish they the ones that's datin my woman
Gone get a good look cause she fine
and I don't mind cause she mine

[Chorus] + [Hook]

[Chris Brown]
I got all this love inside of me
and all I wanna do is give it to her
I don't care what the fellas say about it
cause I got somethin to say about it
What I'm about to say is straight up real talk
No cut I don't play about it
There ain't a price you can put on a girl
who knows just what to say when you need to hear it the most
And I'ma tell you somethin else
If I don't know nothin else I know

[Chorus] + [Hook]

[Verse 3]
I wanna give her the world and I ain't even tryna lose her
I'm addicted to my girl and the way that she twirls
in that little skirt just for me in the club
In the crib in the streets she represent for L B dub
E-N-T she a nice with the pretty brown bright eyes
I'm a winner with the right prize
I'ma give it to her to the rhythm of a hi-hat
She got a beautiful mind you can't buy that
And the site of her behind when she walk on by make a {nigga} wanna try that
She got the prettiest smile and she gangsta
Keep me from runnin wild and I thank her
Ad we can talk about anything she got good conversation
My homie and my friend and plus she patient

[Chorus] + [Hook]
