[Intro: Crooked I]
There comes a time, in everybody's life
when they gotta make a change
I'm tired of bein a villain
I'ma change

[Chorus: Sally Anthony]
I'm not gon' be, your, villain, an-y-more
And don't think I'll live, a, life, of, keep-ing score
I'm not gon' be, your, villain, an-y-more
And don't think I'll live, a, life, of, keep-ing score
I'm not gon' be

[Crooked I]
Flat broke, livin in the hood
When I need money I'll be up to no good
Your family's rich, my family's poor
I would trade places wit'chu if I could
But I gotta play with the cards I was dealt
Down on my knees, ask God for some help
Man of the house, my dad walked out
Mistakes get made when you father yourself
I was raised on the block, a menace to society
But as a little kid I was innocent entirely
Time went by, life got hard
'Til I start feelin like a villain was inside of me
Mad at the world, but I can't cry
Heart full of pain, when I can't lie
I did a lot of dirt, but now I wanna change
To the bad guy in me I say bye (bye, bye)

[Chorus]

[Crooked I - over Chorus]
I don't wanna be the villain no more
(AY! AY!)
No more

[Crooked I]
I don't wanna be the villain no more
Inside my mind fightin my own war
Half of me wants to be the good guy
but the other half wants to kick down yo' door
Mixed emotions, they start to confuse me
Last night I hopped in my car with an uzi
Haters don't feel me, some wanna kill me
I don't really wanna be the star of this movie
Too many years I done fought off regret
I'ma +Bale+ like Christian and walk off the set
You could tell the director, and the producer
to that keep noose when it fall off my neck
I was hangin myself, I couldn't breathe
Trapped in the ghetto, I couldn't leave
I couldn't think, I couldn't see
I couldn't take it, man I couldn't be
Guess I thought it was nothin else out there
for a drop-out raised on welfare
Brave enough to rob a bank in a heartbeat
But too scared to take my life elsewhere
It ain't easy, to go straight
Blind faith, step to the plate
I packed up my bag, I walked out the door
I ain't comin back around this bitch 'til I'm great (great, great)

[Chorus]

[Crooked I - over Chorus]
I don't wanna be the villain no more
(AY! AY!)
No more
I don't wanna be the villain no more
No more

[Crooked I]
Put your hands in the air if you feel me
I'ma change my life if it kill me
Put your hands in the air if you feel me
I'ma change my life if it kill me
Put your hands in the air if you feel me
I'ma change my life if it kill me
Put your hands in the air if you feel me
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be

[Outro: Sally Anthony]
I'm not gon' be, your, villain, an-y-more
And don't think I'll live, a, life, of, keep-ing score
I'm not gon' be {*echoes*}

[Crooked I] No more</pre>
