"You have heard so much about him
But in a few minutes you're going to hear from him"
"Ye-eee-ah, ha ha ha" ---&gt; The D.O.C.

"Listen to me! Listen!
I don't want your applause
I want you to hear what I have to say"

[Professor Griff]
This is the situation, I'll make you understand
My place in this world and how I'm livin' as a black man
Striving to be someone that could be respected
Put on this Earth with a gift
'Cause I'm elected by the G the O the diggy diggy D
Spike doma ek dilbar
and I swear, swear you understand this
Critical, I know the subject is deep
But four hundred and thirty-four years I can't repeat it
I teach you of the global plan
Designed and hatched by the man with the mark in his head
Put the mark in his hand
Now, to the man on the boar who has very little meaning
No hatin' involved now it's time to start redeemin'
Not makin' it tough, but you have to use your brain
Think about it, we're like pawns in the game

[Professor Griff]
Three hundred and sixty degrees, it's a circle
A 10 percent baby, I'll ??
Correct 'em, then I'll leave him speechless
Caressing his ego, then I'll teach 'em this lesson
To the so-called Negroes, the chosen people that needs to grow up
To a free level of independence, let me tell you what it's all about
To make it clear, to be a prime example
And to erase the fear, who put it in our hearts
I don't mind, but I want no part
Of your total destruction, be it known
Let's continue this function while I'm in my prime
of letting you all know that it's about time

"Our entertainers can't speak out, poor pitiful things"
"But we got a plan that's grand"
"Y'all wanna hear that beat right,
Bring that beat back" ---&gt; Public Enemy

[Professor Griff]
Pawn is the piece and the piece is controlled
but brothers and sisters, I know you got soul
Exodus 21 verse 16 is free and foreseen
Now you know what I mean
Now you can take this, or let it alone
The total solution is not in this song
But now it's too late, you dun sealed your fate
Because the UPC is revealed, there is no escape
Revolution is sweeping the entire nation
Over and over and over, and guess what? *EXPLOSION*
Game's over
