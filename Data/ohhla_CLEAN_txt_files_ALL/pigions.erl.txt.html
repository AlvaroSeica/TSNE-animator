[Earl Sweatshirt]
Welcome back to class bitch, grab on to your glasses
Odd Future leaving even niggaz in past tense
Style is patent, the measures is drastic
Either that or they 4:4, some call them fantastic
She called me fantastic, I called her a fat bitch
Still kill the pussy, put the cat in a casket
The funeral service was fuckin worthless, so I said a couple words at it
Didn't know her but I'm confirmin that she sure gurgled dick
The +Odd+ nigga with a spoon in your Danimals
As hungry as a cannibal, trapped in a van of cantaloupes
Harder than granite, hoes know I'm cumin
with the grand force of Van Damme's fist in a damn cannon so
fans catch us on Animal Planet, trackin hoes
and attackin faster than foes can change the channel, whoa~!
My dick hates sweaters so she jack it slow
The aftermath proves to be smoother than hair relaxer, no

[Chorus 2X: Earl &amp; Tyler]
Wave high to the Ritalin regiment
Double S shit, swastikas on the Letterman, bitch
Hungry Wolves at the door, bitch, let us in
Kill 'em all, O.F. what I represent

[Earl Sweatshirt]
Took the van, went snatch her
Oh, you wanna snap and scratch? Snap your fuckin jabber
Wocky, she's a dancer, walkie-talkie Ace for back up like
"Fag, I got class and can't take this bitch to math, what"
Tell the fuckingteacher that this burlap sack is filled
with snacks for after class for the whole class to smack up
Yeah; right, get over here faster
cause Earl's a pro rapper but amateur kidnapper

[Tyler, the Creator]
Earl, God damm it, I'm still in my damn pajamas
Waiting on mom to bring me the aspirin from a trampoline jump
And if I pick her up, I'm humping and I'm fuckin with no lubricant
I'm using spit, piss, vaseline or something
How old is she? (Seventeen) This bitch is underage
But I'll have her face off tied and Nicholas +Caged+
But anyway, give me cash fag, cause I'm low on gas
Aww fuck it, about to jack off, go catch a fuckin cab
No I'm not lyin when I say that brother's all I have
but if you're not dyin don't fucking bother to call me back
I'm sleep {*phone rings with no answer*}

[Chorus]

[Interlude: repeat 2X]
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
Odd Future here to steer you to what the fuck's cool
Fuck rules, skate life, rape write, repeat twice
Odd Future young enough to get your priest mouth drool

[Earl Sweatshirt]
I don't give a fuck, like a senior citizen
Shit and run, back to the lab need assistance from
sister with the biggest bum..baclot girls
I'm around calves big. cause they run a lot and scream oh
Pay him some attention, he's smart and he's genius
And he ain't touching me like Martin Sheen's penis
Y'all niggaz ain't clean as my team is meanest
Hitting amputees in the kneesus, Jesus
Please, just peep the +Crystal Method+ where
I take a fucking beat, strip it naked then I wreck it
It's no question, Sweatshirt's O.F.
And you can tell by the chiseled horns on my forehead bitch
Hammer hat flyer than a bag of bats
And Jade's a fucking acrobat, I'll flip her on a mattress
Last straw, fuck that~! I'm who broke the camel's back
Say you want that dope shit? Welcome to Satan's cabbage patch
Bitch!

[Tyler, the Creator]
Told you he could rap
Dumb motherfucker</pre>
