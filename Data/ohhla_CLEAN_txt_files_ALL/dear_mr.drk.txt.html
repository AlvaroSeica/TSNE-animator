[Intro]
{W-W-Welcome to Heat Academy}
Gyah...

[Derek Minor]
I was nine years old when daddy first touched me
At fifteen, I ran away and never stopped running
I met a man who took me in cause I was pretty though
And said that you could make some money in my video-ooh
I get high and drunk, just to make it through a show
and act like I'm enjoyin it but really this is all a show
I feel degraded, purity obliterated
This is all I know, I really hate it!
Mr. Minor, are you listening? I know that you're a Christian
and got computer programs to block me from your vision
And err'time you watch me, you say that I'm the issue
Your pastor preachin 'bout how not to let me catch you slippin
But maybe I'm a victim, maybe I'm just trapped in the system
And next time you pray, maybe I might get a mention (Please!)
Before you talk about me, remember that I'm lost
and your secret pleasure coming at a cost

[Chorus]
Dear Mr. Christian, I know you're on a mission
I know you say the answer to my problem is religion
I know I'm supposed to change the way I live and stop sinning
But I'd appreciate it if you take some time to listen
Dear Mr. Christian, I know you're on a mission
I know you say the answer to my problem is religion
I know I'm supposed to change the way I live and stop sinning
But I'd appreciate it if you take some time to listen
Dear Mr. Christian

[Dee-1]
Uno.. Man, I'm on that chronic, higher than a comet
Sippin gin and tonic, drinkin 'til I vomit
Tatted on my arms like, tatted on my face yeah
Pants hangin low, ah! Nina on my waist, ah!
I be slangin soft, plus I got that hard
Die for my hood, ride for my boulevard
I got love for my dogs (yea), but never for these girls (naw)
It's M.O.E. (why) cause money rule the world
But Mr. Dee-1, I grew up crummy, saw my pops get killed in front of me
Saw my momma do dope in front of me, felt like ain't nobody love me
Uniform dirty, dressin bummy, went to school they called me ugly
Caught the bus, they used to jump me, God I just prayed to You Sunday!
Now it's Monday, I'm starvin, sip sour milk out the carton
Talk to myself while I'm walkin, should I put myself in a coffin?
I DON'T KNOW!! All I grew up with is trouble
Ain't know no role model, I knew the struggle

[Chorus]

[Lecrae]
Ah-a-AHEM! Excuse me, I don't quite understand ya
Propaganda and banter and all of this empty chatter
And amidst these amens, hallelujahs and shuck and jivin
I see a lot of hypocrites and hyper-criticizing
Mr. Lecrae, my momma sold me up the river for some rocks
and dayy told me I was nothing but a problem
Now here you come tellin me I'm a low down dirty sinner 
And you got the nerve to wonder why I'm in these streets robbin?/Robin
Well go and get Batman, and go and get back man
I don't need to be juudged by you and all of your wack friends
Ain't gluttony a sin? Why you staring at my gin?
Where I'm from we don't pretend, we know we ain't gettin in!
Now the world don't trust me, and these streets done crushed me
Thought you were known for love but you just love to judge me
Truth is ironically, you need me around though
Cause otherwise, you got nobody else to look down on

[Chorus]</pre>
