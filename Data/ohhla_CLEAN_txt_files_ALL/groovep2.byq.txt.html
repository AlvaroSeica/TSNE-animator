[Suga Free]
Mm hmm, check it out
I overlook your condescending tone
If you heed the gravity in mind
Let me pimp, don't make me pimp
Let me

[Chorus: ScHoolboy - SZA in background]
Got a sack of marijuana, think I'm 'bout to bend a corner
Ain't no telling who my money for
Got my dope from cross the border
Got my home on Figueroa, ain't no telling where that pussy go

Will you sell that pussy for me?
Will you sell that pussy for me?
Will you sell that pussy for me?
Will you sell that pussy for me?
Will you sell that pussy for me?
Will you sell that pussy for me?

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy]
Check the forecast, it's wavy Q
I should make the news
My fortune said that I'll be pimpin' you and your pussy juice
Super sweet, sell a trick a treat
Hope your lips in shape, cuz you worked yo feet
As you stroll them streets
Beeper checkin', hope no cops arrestin'
Girl, I told you them NARCS be pressin'
Better act you a pedestrian and don't mention my name
My pimpin' is game
Cold limp with my cane, got gold on my chain
Come pinky my ring, it's so blickety bling
On 51st and Fig, grew up about 10 minutes from the real Ricky
Where the shoelaces is orange with "H" hats like we from Houston
Condoms in hoes' purses
With baby wipes for they coochie
You's a ho that's selling booty
No need to be acting bougie
Bitch, I give your ass a noogie
And a chicken nugget and make you watch me at the movies
I'm panoramic, my filming be rated pimping
My mink draggin' with two bitches that go and get it, my hoes get it!

[Chorus 2]
Will you sell that pussy for me?
Will you sell that pussy for me? (Yeah that's right Q!)
Will you sell that pussy for me?
Will you sell that pussy for me?
Will you sell that pussy for me?
Will you sell that pussy for me?
Hut one, hut two, hut three, hut four
Sell that pussy for me
Will you sell that pussy for me?
Will you sell that pussy for me?
Will you sell that pussy for me?
Hut one, hut two, hut three, hut four
Sell that pussy for me
Will you sell that pussy for me?
Will you sell that pussy for me? (I ain't asking!)

I'm tellin' you
Bitch!

[Verse 2: Suga Free]
Uh huh, yeah watch me go Black Forest ham
A new school player laced with the old gift gab
And don't let yo Shark Week mouth override yo Green Goldfish ass
So for every ho you clown, I'ma crown too
And anything good hurts and I cried
Shit I just don't want to throw it up in my motherfuckin' face
Or I choose to not do this around you
See ho you like a brain aneurysm
Want two heads with the same dandruff in 'em
Only to scratch the itch with baby rattlesnake fangs
No Head and Shoulders or anti-venom
Yea P, this is gentlemanly leisure, the oldest game left to play
And the hard hed that make a soft ass played out
Will forgive and forget yesterday!
Now get em Q
A pimp on foot, go to sleep, call us, wake up to a Cadillac
Remember Forrest Gump walked and.. he was pretty stupid
So you know what?
Accept the fact that the bitch belongs to the world P cuz
That ho only yours as long as she hoin'
But Happy Pimpin' and Merry Ho Ho
Keep an eye on bottom bitch too
Cuz that bitch'll run a ho or two off mayn
Pimps only fuck with pimps homie that's why we so solid
Red to blue, to debt, to due
It's easier to put a watermelon through the eye of a needle
This is done by choice, not by force
I ain't askin', I'm tellin' you

[Chorus]</pre>
