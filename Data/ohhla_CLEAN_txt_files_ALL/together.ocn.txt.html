[Frank Ocean]
Ohhh, we're in this together, have a little faith
Ohhh, you ought to know who you are
Oh we're all children, we're all human
We're all breathing, we're all needing
More than, what they're giving
Can't you feel it? The space of what's missing

[Chorus 1]
You look up and they tell you it's a Godless sky, a Godless sky
So you look down
Cause you've convinced yourself
That this is all you've got, all you've got

[Chorus 2]
Now picture four billion hearts beating with you, with ours
Picture four billion faces held high, for love
If there's one thing about this world I know
It's that we're in it, together
You're not alone, I'm not alone
If there's one thing about this world I know
We're together

[Frank Ocean]
I love you, and I don't know you
But I know the light in you, is the same as in me
I trust you, like a brother
Cause you could understand the pain
Better than someone who's going through it

[Chorus 1] + [Chorus 2]

[Frank Ocean]
I've searched the souls of my people
For something to believe in
Oh not words that I could say
But I heard them, I heard them

[Chorus 2]</pre>
