[Intro]
I had a change of heart, I went from so many and too much
and then I narrowed it down to you

[Verse 1]
I ain't never been into the title thing
'cause I figured that the next step was buy a ring
never thought I'd be saying "girl this is not a fling"
or be trying to sing, but shorty you're my girl
Just in case you had a doubt about it
I know the topic came up, I know I bounced around it
But I stepped my game up, and I'm kinda proud that
I finally found her
I mean you. I mean us, I mean we, I'm done with the fun and games
Way back this song woulda had 20 names
And every line to every chick woulda been just the same
Girl it's you and I, see how I used to lie
They responded to the Stimuli
once they saw the meal came biggie sized
they would get hypnotized
And ask me for one more chance
But I'm gone now they don't understand

[Chorus]
Baby it's no hard to see, you and I were meant to be
Girl I dropped those other things, now I want to be your king

[Verse 2]
Don't front you know I got you open girl
Don't front you know I got you open girl
No fronting on my side, I'm focused girl
You turn me on every day like I'm Oprah girl
You intellectual witty, a good combo of sexy and pretty
those nights I'm caressing your kitty
watching reruns of Sex and the City
got my head getting dizzy just thinking bout it wooh
See with me, I'm a different dude
I don't gotta stick and move, just to switch your mood
you could sit and cool out in the living room
I'll be in the kitchen, food cooking but the dinner's you
You know I put it down, I might throw you on the table or the counter you in my world
And you know I lift frowns get you wet enough to make a fish drown 'cause you my girl

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
There's no other girl in the world that's better than you
Than you
And there's nobody else on the planet that can do what I do
What I do
So you should let me, make you feel new
It'll be us, just us 2
No more stress, no bad news
Whatever you go through I'm your dude and you're my girl

LAST TIME 

[Verse 3]
Everything inside, everything inside
I give on the stage 'cause I'm so real
I say the shit I truly feel and I don't lie
they want me to lie, they say I should talk about my guns
and how much weight I used to deal but I might cry
they don't wanna know how I got by
how I started writing rhymes because when I was at that job
I almost died, thought that I would die
so many kids in my hood are shooting, selling
banging I can't tell 'em that ain't fly

[Chorus]
This might be my last time
this might be my last time here
please believe me I'm so scared this is my last time
this could be my last time
so if this ain't what you wanna hear its ok
I'm so prepared to say goodbye... to say goodbye

[Verse 4]
I'm not a teacher or a preacher, if you think I do this shit
to just get signed or to bag some dimes, you don't know my grind
you should turn this off, because you're wasting both our time
I want you to dream, I want you to lead
I want you to want to change your life

[Chorus]</pre>
