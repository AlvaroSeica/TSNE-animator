[Intro: Brevi]
{Statik Selektah!} Aiyyo Ap', whattup man?
Nah nah, like
Kids be runnin up actin crazy at shows and shit
Niggaz know they don't know you like that

[Chorus: Apathy]
Cause when the mic's off and when the beat stops
I'm only human homie, it's only hip-hop
And when the show's over and when the curtains drop
I'm just a person man, it's only hip-hop
{"Now I'm in the limelight cause I rhyme tight" - B.I.G.}
It's only hip-hop
{"Now I'm in the limelight cause I rhyme tight" - B.I.G.}
It's only hip-hop

[Apathy]
I never thought when I was younger anybody'd know
a single word of my raps or memorize my flow
Now I'm mesmerized when they show up at my shows
and wanna pose for photos rockin Apathy clothes
They askin me about Vinnie and our religious belief
They askin me about Kamachi, if we had real beef
What I think about Kanye, if I really hate him
And then proceed to repeat me my freestyle verbatim
I love my fans and wouldn't trade 'em but somebody gotta train 'em
Momma need to raise 'em how to act around emcees
I was a fan but always respected boundaries
You'd never catch me askin Method Man about his seeds
Love is love, love is real, love is great
But when it isn't reciprocated it could become hate
Frustrated cause I never responded to you on Twitter
Maybe I just didn't see it don't be gettin all bitter
Listen~!

[Chorus]

[Apathy]
And when the songs were done, and when the beats were over
I gave a pound and kept it movin never sweated Hova
Fans analyze our rhymes artwork and posters
and treat Mike Shinoda like he's Deepak Chopra
I'm real appreciative but please act like you supposed to
I hate suckers like Hex Murda hates Oprah
It's cool if you say your favorite rapper's Apathy
But don't be gettin all overzealous and faggoty
They askin me about Celph and if he got all them guns
Askin me about my personal life and my funds
Jokin with me like they known me for years
You're just a little too comfortable homey we're not peers
Don't greet me by my government name just cause you bought my album
You wouldn't walk up on Snoop Dogg and call him Calvin
Listen man, it's a real simple rule
Keep cool don't be comin out your mouth like a fool
You know?

[Chorus]

[Outro: Apathy]
I'd like to thank, my brother Statik Selektah
{Statik Selektah} lacin me with this beat
I'd also like to thank, my real fans who support
and show love, without gettin out of place
Oversteppin boundaries, be a man motherfucker
Yeah, Apathy, Demigodz
Pharoahe clique, forever motherfucker
Yeah, whattup Brevi?</pre>
