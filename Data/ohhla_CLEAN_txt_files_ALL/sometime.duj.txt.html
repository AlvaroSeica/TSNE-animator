Chorus:
Sometimes I feel
Like the world
Is closing in on me (4x)

Verse 1: Mojo
I'm from the borough where there's
Crack on the corners and rappers on the runways
Since 9-11 seeing soldiers on the subways
The hood is hell but god visits on Sundays
And cats with high hopes try to make it here someday
I'm from the city where it's bigger than it seems
Where kids with big dreams meet with killers with cream
And it's difficult to live in your means or go beyond
When babies are rocking jerseys like they'repart of the team
I'm from the state where the funding is lean for education
Hate for the governor's schemes and hesitations
I'm from the nation where you bleed for reservations
Seems the foundation was greed and segregation
I'm from the planet where you need precipitation
If the rain don't fall then the weeds can get impatient
Pray I'm universally heard on every station
But the way this world's looking got me waiting for the spaceship sometimesS


Chorus

Verse 2: MasD

This stress don't stop ergo
I watch my hair go
Don't let it get me down stay smooth like Nair dome
There ain't really no places where I wouldn't dare roam
I traipse through the lion's den with bare flow
More than a fair show
Grab the microphone and let my cares go
Three sheets to the wind
Pissing upstream wettin' the bed
Head full of steam
So wicked I ain't getting to dream
With nothing to lose
Cool down the pace I'm bustin' a move
I take my time not to rush it when discussin' the groove
I'm crushing the blues
Burning the green, seeing red
So much thoughts ain't even room for no hair on my head
Though in my mind's eye jah know me have fi see me a dread
Rasta
Repping the Babylon born and bred
Running off my random
Full with New York pride
I spit with more chutzpah than the Upper East Side
This making ends meat/meet is tasting like I'm wasting my time
On chasing these rhymes

Chorus

Verse 3: Rheturik

Nowadays it's gimme gimme
No chivalry smoke up the chimney
Real people ven aqui get at me
Feed off my energy
We live in lean times with very few amenities
Kids seeking identities
Feel it's well worth the penalty to
Pop something off and hold their spot down or
Knock something off and blow the spot quick
Reap the benefits
Funny thing is the same sentiments exist
Up in the writ of unelected candidates
You sit in your jeep they sit in their jeep
But all the while they under guise of keeping the peace
They police beef while we beef with police
Spreading freedom
At least that's what they said in their speech
I take it all in with a grain of salt
And thank whoever's up above I'm from New York
'Cause when we go 'round
It's like you're all on tour with me
And when it goes down
I know I got the world with me, so c'mon
