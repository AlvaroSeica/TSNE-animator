[Baby Bash]
Fa sho

[Frankie J.]
So tight
So fly
You got me lifted
You got me lifted

Chorus: Frankie J.
Got me lifted, shifted higher than the ceilin'
And ooohwee, it's the ultimate feelin'
You got me lifted, feeling so gifted
Sugar, how you get so fly

Hook: Frankie J.
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly

Pre-Verse: Baby Bash
You know it's leather when we ride
Wood grain and raw hide
Doing what we do, watchin' screens gettin' high
Girl, you keep it so fly, with your sweet honey buns
You was there when the money was gone
You'll be there when the money comes

[Baby Bash]
(Verse 1)
Off top, I can't lie
I love to get blowed
You my little sugar, I'm your little chulo
And every time we kick it
It's off to the groovy
Treat you like my sticky ickey
Or my sweet oooh-wee, gooey (Fa real, though)

Repeat Chorus &amp; Hook

(Verse 2)
Now, I ain't
Worried about a thang cause I just hit me a lick
I got a
Fat sack and a superfly chick
And uh-uh
And there ain't natin' you can say to a player
Cause doo wop
She fly like the planes in the air
That's right, she full grown, settin' the wrong tone
I'm diggin' the energy and I'm lovin' her ozone
So fly, like a dove
Fly, like a raven
Quick, to politic with some fly, conversation
In a natural mood, then I'm a natural dude
And we some natural fools, blowin' out by the pool
She like my sexy cool mama, we'll blaze on the Barada
Rockin' Dolce &amp; Gabbana, hydro in the Guana (Ah)

Repeat Chorus &amp; Hook

Repeat Pre-Verse Twice

[Baby Bash]
Fa real, though

Repeat Chorus &amp; Hook

[Baby Bash]
So high, like I'm a star
So high, like I'm a star
So high, like I'm a star
So high, like I'm a star
