[Verse 1: Suffa]
Check, I love hip hop (hip hop)
But fuck me, sometimes it feel like hip hop don't love me
And I learnt this from every single person that burnt us
Since we dropped The Calling it's been like a fucking circus
Now Hau's(?) feeling worthless about how many you sold
And Hau's(?) feeling nervous cos your record went cold
Cause if you move too many units you fuck the underground off
Obviously it's all poppy and they try to cut it down what
Fuck me now man could this be really happening
They're actually pressuring and questioning my love
I never compromised a rhyme for a crumb or a crust
'Cause pressure always said let them come to us
I never dropped the ball for 200 grand
I'd rather be fucking poor and have 200 fans
And if you understand I couldn't be more grateful
Cause everyday this culture gets more hateful, singing

[Chorus: Pressure] {X2}
And the fire that your burnings the same one you lit
The lyric that comes back on yous the same one you bit
The grave that you buried is the same one you dig
Ya feel big? (ya feel big)
Ya feel big? (ya feel big)

[Verse 2: Pressure]
Deer listener
This ain't a resignation this is a
Thanks for your time, I had you in mind in lyrics for
Everything I ever wrote, every quote
Every cent that I spent to studio time when I was broke
Collegially roads an option that I never worked for sake of sentiment
Fuck it, every word I said I meant
I bowed for the head, growled full of sweat
Telling me to keep it real, 15 years is how real it get
Some acting ill that never had a deal
Don't know the difference between a mass of skill and mass appeal
Let me know if I've done something to desert you
You never know how much you love something 'til it hurts you
And I ain't gonna work 'til I die in a shirt and a tie
Starvin on a super for my service to lie
to take flight from, I cares all night long
Cause I don't wanna wake in the morning and wonder where my life's gone

[Chorus] {X2}

[Verse 3:Suffa]
To any MC or crew whos'e dissed us since we dropped The Calling
Jealous little fuckers, I got a song for ya
Check it out
Fuck you and you and you so clap your hands (clap your hands)
Fuck you and you and you so clap your hands (so clap your hands)
Fuck you and you and you so clap your hands (clap your hands)
Fuck you and you and you so clap your hands (clap your hands)
When your gangsta rap become the new underground
You people are embarassing yourselves
'Cause real crims they just do it
They don't rhyme about it
And no doubt they put it out on a 12
What the fuck you try'na sell?

[Pressure]
All you fucking fake rappers
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

[Pressure talking]
This is for all of those that dissed us to try get their name out there
("What the fuck makes you think I'd put your name on my record")
