[Killah Priest]
Take a glipse, at all the crack whores and the pimps
The hustlers and the gamblers
The gangsters, the killers, the number runners
The drug dealers and all the petty thieves
And the card shark scramblers
The city cops raidin' the spots
Niggas tryna get their guap
(What you doin' over here?)
Got their glock, gunshots, this is my block
In the tallest building
And the longest, coldest nights
I got something to tell y'all
You won't believe me
But I killed the devil last night
That's right, I shot 'em dead
One in his head, one in his heart
I tore his fuckin' horns apart
I killed the devil last night
And I knew it was him cuz when he came in my room
He had a grin
And on his neck and face
Was white and black and yellow and brown and red skin
He had a bad white suit
He offered me a fruit
And his pockets were bulgin' wit alotta loot
I told 'em I been lookin' for you
I swear to God y'all, all this is true
I killed the devil last night
I shot 'em cold blooded
He looked at me, his eyes fluttered
He's gon' y'all, dead, he no longer exists
I know my baby-moms is pissed
Now we can get along and everything should be cool
All the girlfriends are confused
They don't know what to do
Cuz I killed the devil last night
I did it for Marcus
I did it for Malcolm, Martin and Marvin
I did it for all God's son
And his daughters, I'm the author
I killed the devil last night
I was neva scared of his punk ass anyways
I'm from Brooklyn
Brooklyn born and Brooklyn raised
I shot 'em cuz he's a hater
This mornin' I woke up and knocked on the door of my neighbors 
And I told 'em I killed the devil last night
Tell the press, the FBI and the cops
Oh yeah, the devil is right up stairs in my room on the floor shot
Tell those Christians and those sinners they can go to heaven
I used my weapon, he's gon' for good
I'm just tryna clean up my neighborhood
I killed the devil last night (Right on brother)
Drag Lucifer by his horns
My thoughts are nuclear; my mind is an atomic bomb
I am the Bible covered by the Qur'an
Kill Shaitan, yeah I did it, I'll admit it
It was nothin', he was frontin'
He has no power except what we give 'em
Ourselves and ourselves we devour
Again he has no powers
I did it and you could too
Just look for him, don't run from him
Just do like I do
Stare 'em in his face
Face-to-face, let's go
Toe-to-toe, blow-for-blow
You can't hurt me no more
The ghetto, you gots to go
Get out God house devil
I'm Almighty, the King, the Author of light
The warrior with wings, bearer of the cross and the light
The rock the faith, the judge of the livin' and dead
Man from heaven, over hell I tread
My angels sing
Last night I killed the devil
No lie, he don't exist no more
So you can do whateva you want
You can achieve any goal you want
You can get that brand new car
You can go into the ether zones
You can beam ya self up
The devil is gon', I killed 'em</pre>
