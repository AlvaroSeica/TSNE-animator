Take off aww shit take off aww shit

[Verse 1: Young Dro]
Young Dro we in the club My Wrist cost a hunnid rats
When I pop a pill I take off like a thundercat
9 carrat stone with the platinum all up under dat

I'm pakistan pillin rollin like a yayo
Tha ferari with the lakehouse

Don't let the swagg breakout that shit like disease

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Young Dro]
OK now big pimp squad tear your boyz apart
Stay out our trap stay out our yard

I'm a westside boi yeah potna potna potna
Goin get them suckaz tell em that it's over
This is a jack truck this is not a rover
30 inch rider you ain't even worth it
I'm in my own world trick we on different earthes
Sittin up in my lambo don't make me turn to rambo

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Yung LA]
I'm a gonna take off lambourgini top off
Own line air head same colour spaceoff
Futuristic lelo ralph lauren pilo G4 takin off every city we go
Goin across the globe you don't go the places we go
Connected with the king you don't know the people we know
White boy steelo black boy bakino
Black and white swagg got me feelin like melato
Pockets extra sloppy feelin like I hit the lotto
Floatin through the city offsets on the idol
You tried to keith sweat me like the chick from desperado
2 guns on me like the movie desperado

[Chorus]</pre>
