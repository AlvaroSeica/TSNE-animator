[Intro: 9th Prince]
One-two, one-two
What the fuck you wanna do?

[9th Prince]
All haters get cut in they face with razors
It's just a friendly game of baseball
And I'm striking out all playas
Sharpen my sword, sharpen my pen
Sharpen my blade, again and again
Niggas living in the projects with sharp objects
I take my respect, so Protect Ya fucking Neck
I'm too live, with ya baby mama getting head across the Harlem River Drive
Never take a dive when it's time to survive
Niggas slap me five cuz I'm no jive
All my Killa Beez living out of beehives
I'm automatic like a .45, taking lives
Yeah, we living in a culture with vulture
Carrying toasters in the holsters, pulling out on posers
I guess they suppose to, I started out rhyming in the parks like Rosa

[Chorus 2X: 9th Prince]
Aiyo, fuck these rap niggas, I spit bars at these rap niggas
For the new millennium, 9th Prince flow sicker
I do this for rhyme spitters, and heavy hitters
The Industry Grave Digga

[9th Prince]
Aiyo, smooth criminal, my message never subliminal
Always direct and effect, while niggas claiming they emperial
Serial killa, turn niggas into zombies like Michael Jackson Thriller
I'm on my grind, you move too slow, like turtles and caterpillas
I'm moving through your hood like a ninja
Yeah, the grand finale, build with the Gods at the rally
Where's all my West Coast Killa Beez?
I'm going back to Cali, lick off shots at Bill O'Reilly
Fly like Nike Airs, whenever I go to war I come prepared
Deaf in my left year, but still sincere
About my career, live without fears
And giving niggas cold stares, Nature Boy like Ric Flair
Born to gamble, natural born gambler
Knock off competitors, wrestle with alligators
And choke lions, like a wrestler

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
