This part of the tape is dedicated to my man Dilla
You're gonna be sorely missed my nigga, word
And this is the (WHAT~!) if portion of the tape
And what if... De La would have got, the "Do You" beat
that S.V. used from J.D. first
I mean, we wanted that joint BAD y'all
But - by the time we reached out for it
Jay let us know, my man got it and umm
They did their thing on it y'all but yo
This is our version of it, here it is
It's called "Relax"</pre>
