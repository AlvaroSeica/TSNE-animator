Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Say she in king of diamonds monday
Ain't scared to get that money
In back in church by sunday
But we all know she's in love with that pole, pole, pole
She's in love with that pole, pole, pole
Ugh, say she in school tuesday through friday
Friday night that's my day
But saturday through sunday, she 'bout money
She ain't scared of that pole, pole, pole
She ain't scared of that pole, pole, pole

Said she in love with that pole
She so in love with that pole
She love wakin up, love wakin up, wakin up with that doe
I love it when she come home all the way drunk and all the way throwed
Said "boy be on that way, so you call me on that road
Got that drink up in my cup but that don't mean that I move slow
Drank up in my cup but that don't mean that I fuck slow"
She got a tattoo on her ass
You know it say kirko
She tattooed to her cash, shaking that ass and lettin it go
She like "baby boy don't trip about it, everything you hear 'cause these hoes
Sneak around on the low and I'm just out here getting my doe"
I'm like "baby girl don't trip about it, everything you hear 'cause these hoes
Sneak around on the low and knowin they wanna get on that pole"

Say she in king of diamonds monday
Ain't scared to get that money
In back in church by sunday
But we all know she's in love with that pole, pole, pole
She's in love with that pole, pole, pole
Ugh, say she in school tuesday through friday
Friday night that's my day
But saturday through sunday, she 'bout money
She ain't scared of that pole, pole, pole
She ain't scared of that pole, pole, pole

Shit, said she in love with that pole
So in love with that pole
Don't care what nobody tell her, stackin that cheddar stackin that doe
Lil mama stackin that change
Lil mama stackin that change
She go to school, got a good job, she ain't waitin until she get changed, nuh-uh
When she show-up, the show stops, throw her doe up, got a drop top
Keep it closed up when she drop her top and get closer
Ugh, she making that money and breaking these bitches in two
Got niggas droolin and bitches too
She a good girl, from the hood girl, doin make-up, when she get there
Everybody like "how'd you get that? did you hit that? how'd you get her? "
With a pretty face and that good ass hair
With a little waste and that big ol ass

Say she in king of diamonds monday
Ain't scared to get that money
In back in church by sunday
But we all know she's in love with that pole, pole, pole
She's in love with that pole, pole, pole
Ugh, say she in school tuesday through friday
Friday night that's my day
But saturday through sunday, she 'bout money
She ain't scared of that pole, pole, pole
She ain't scared of that pole, pole, pole</pre>
