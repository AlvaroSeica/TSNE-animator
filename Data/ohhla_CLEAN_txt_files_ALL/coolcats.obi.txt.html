[Obie Trice]
Aiyyo I got popularity so I'm packin a plastic
No time for pussy ass niggaz who haven't had it
They envy on this nigga cause I RÃ©my on them niggaz
And fuck that bitch Tamika trendy on them niggaz
I'm Obie fuckin Trice, the coolest nigga you know
I can't stay cool if my blood pressure grows
That's when niggaz gotta catch blows - hollows
You know you fucked up when you see me pacin the flows
That's when niggaz find they face in the flo's
That's when niggaz dicks get dirty from the waist on the flows
I don't wanna have to be gone
and let my daughter roll in this crazy world alone

[Chorus One]
(Come on~!) I'm a cool nigga first, grimy nigga later
Grimy is like when y'all cats is playa haters
Cool is like when y'all niggaz is innovators
But grimy is all I've seen, yo
I'm a cool nigga first, grimy nigga later
Grimy is like when y'all niggaz is playa haters
Cool is like when y'all niggaz is innovators
But grimy is all I've seen, yo

[Obie Trice]
I got a sick four-fifth, with two cartridges
And I ain't even wanna have to tell y'all niggaz but shit
Maybe that'll just derail y'all niggaz
If not, fuck it, blaow~! To hell y'all niggaz
I'm from School Craft, where everybody fam
Runnin the block like Booby D, that's my man
Up in the Kit-Kat with Kitty gettin busy
You can't roll the hood like, "Obie Trice, where is he?"
That type of shit'll get you shot real quickly
Gotta know the code or the, pistol explodes
Pistol whip you then piss on your clothes
Still pissed off niggaz'll strip what you drove
I ain't nobody but O
The same nigga that you conversated with when a nigga was broke
Now you wanna front cause pockets got the mumps
and I spit the hot shit givin them want they want

[Chorus One]

[Obie Trice]
I'm a cool nigga first but it could get real grimy
Especially when the pussy tight niggaz wanna try me
I try to let the shit fly by me
But it's kinda hard when you're right behind me like a bitch eyein me
That's when the burner is exposed
Wouldn't give a fuck if it's the club or street, you gotta go!
Cool nigga first, grimy nigga later
Cool nigga first, grimy nigga later

[Chorus Two]
Come on~! Cool nigga first, grimy nigga later
Grimy is like when y'all cats is playa haters
Cool is like when y'all niggaz is innovators
But grimy is all I've seen, c'mon!
I'm a cool nigga first, grimy nigga later
Grimy is like when y'all niggaz is playa hatin
Cool is like when y'all niggaz is innovatin
But grimy is all I've seen, come on!
I'm a cool nigga first, grimy nigga later
Grimy is like when y'all niggaz is playa hatin
Cool is like when y'all niggaz is MOTIVATIN
But grimy is all I've seen, motherfucker!

[Outro]
Yeah, turn this shit the fuck off man</pre>
