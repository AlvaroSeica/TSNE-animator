[Intro]
No new, no new
No new niggas in my ass, we don't fuck with strangers!
Ello bring that shit to fuck back, man!
DJ Victoria!
We don't fuck with no new niggas!

[Chorus]
No new niggas in my ass, we don't fuck with strangers
Pull them pistols out and just get the aiming!
My lil niggas dangerous, found out on probation
But still toasting em bangers, we leave, we're brainless
Cause we love gang banging, you niggas is basic
My time, don't waste it!
Their money, I'm chasing!
I'm counting new faces, in love with Ben Franklins
No patience, no waiting, I'm chasing that paper!

[Verse 1]
I'm counting them faces, I'm shooting that faces
Capture us overseas, I don't do the same places
Switch up the location, while the guys are on payments
No, I am not on papers, ball on, just handle cables!
Free cables, we do cables
No ball out, don't do favors
I smoke go Bobby facing
Getting so loud I can taste it!
They ain't real, they're faking
300, we're the mayors old block affiliated
Ye all these niggas hating

[Chorus]
No new niggas in my ass, we don't fuck with strangers
Pull them pistols out and just get the aiming!
My lil niggas dangerous, found out on probation
But still toasting em bangers, we leave, we're brainless
Cause we love gang banging, you niggas is basic
My time, don't waste it!
Their money, I'm chasing!
I'm counting new faces, in love with Ben Franklins
No patience, no waiting, I'm chasing that paper!

[Verse 2]
I'm chasing that paper!, you got it, I take it!
On the block with the gals, my trap going so crazy
These niggas my sons, I call them my babies
Tec 9s, 3 80s, 22, I let you taste it
Lil boss my favorite!
I love fucking their faces
I do it so major
What? I'm counting that paper!
My finger is aching, I'm counting that paper!
I'm balling like the paces, these niggas is bitches
I tell them to their faces!

[Chorus]
No new niggas in my ass, we don't fuck with strangers
Pull them pistols out and just get the aiming!
My lil niggas dangerous, found out on probation
But still toasting em bangers, we leave, we're brainless
Cause we love gang banging, you niggas is basic
My time, don't waste it!
Their money, I'm chasing!
I'm counting new faces, in love with Ben Franklins
No patience, no waiting, I'm chasing that paper!

[Verse 3]
That money, I chase it
Impatient, no waiting
I dump to their faces
No masses, got faces
I drag car like speed racer
Fuck bitches that be famous
We cash my ocupation
I spend it and save it
My pen's just full of Franklins
Bad bitches none of them basic
Money toss all, I'm thinking
Drown round in that Lincoln
Sip lean so I've been drinking
That molly got her spacing
My foreign plug Jamaican
I chase it, no waiting!

[Chorus]
No new niggas in my ass, we don't fuck with strangers
Pull them pistols out and just get the aiming!
My lil niggas dangerous, found out on probation
But still toasting em bangers, we leave, we're brainless
Cause we love gang banging, you niggas is basic
My time, don't waste it!
Their money, I'm chasing!
I'm counting new faces, in love with Ben Franklins
No patience, no waiting, I'm chasing that paper!</pre>
