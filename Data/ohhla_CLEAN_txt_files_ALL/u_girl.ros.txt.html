Oooh!

Chorus: Sam Salter
It's true, girl
I've never seen nobody work it like
You girl
Hypnotized with the way that you
Move, girl
Baby, come roll with me
And let's
Girl, let's

[Roscoe Umali]
(Verse 1)
If any wondered, wondered, by the one-hit wonder
Here's hit number two in the last two summers
Pulled up smooth in a brand new Hummer
Lookin' all brand new with the brand new stunners
See little mama, and had to get her number
Ass so fat, you could see it from the front
I had to get it from her, in fact, I had to wonder
If I get a chance to run game, then I'm a run it like
"Look here, girl, I love what you working with
I love how you work your hips
Your outfit is a perfect fit, you're perfect
For a boss like me who'll know how to work it (Work it...)

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
Hold up
Wait a minute
Get it, get it, can't wait to get it
And yeah, I got a girl, back home, but you
Make it hard for a player to stay committed, so

Bridge: Sam Salter
(???), you're mine
You gotta let me know
Baby, stop wasting time
Go where you wanna go

(Verse 3)
Let's go, let's get together
Let's get on a jet and change the weather
Whatever you wanna do, we can make it happen
Take a chance with me, that's all I'm askin'

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Avila Brothers {*Sam Salter harmonizing*}]
You, you, you girl
You, you, you know

[Sam Salter &amp; Avila Brothers]
You, already, know
Who's, taking you, home
You, already, know
Who's, taking you, home

[Roscoe Umali]
It's me, girl...
We got another one right here
Avila Brothers

[Sam Salter &amp; Avila Brothers (Avila Brothers in background)]
Y'all ain't ready
Y'all ain't ready (Get it on, get it on)
Y'all ain't ready
No, y'all ain't ready (Get it on, get it on)

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Roscoe Umali (Roscoe Umali &amp; Avila Brothers)]

I see y'all {Get it on, get it on}
Ha ha (Ha ha...)
It's the Artisans {Get it on, get it on}

[Avila Brothers]
Get it on, get it on
Get it on, get it on
Get it on, get it on</pre>
