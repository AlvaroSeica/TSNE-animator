Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

[Intro/Chorus: Skylar Grey]
So can you rescue me?
Because my ship is sinking
And I'm drowning at sea
So can you rescue me from me?
Can you rescue me?

[Royce Da 5'9"]
I was losin my mind like I was tryin to lose it
Usin my time for usin, abusin my grind
This is my own honest view of who I am behind this, music
Ryan the whole bottle of Patrón connoisseur
At a point in time I thought I blew it
Doin crime and I would've washed a pill down with a shot of my own spinal fluid
And my momma knew it, she saw especially right through it
that I wasn't protected cause peer pressure just be like (do it)
But I couldn't fight throught it, the beef started
The streets caught up, at least we ain't get involved in deceased orders
It's Slaughterhouse; cause Shady, me, Porter
sat it down and made peace over porterhouse and Piesporter

[Joell Ortiz]
Some stupid bitch done turned my girl against me
Should've tattooed the Earth on my arm, feel like the world against me
Soon as I pa-rade here come the rain fallin, the name callin
from the cuz I never met with his hand out like I'm straight ballin
Feel like I knocked the 8-ball in
Every time I shoot a move I literally can't call it
Am I afraid of success? Let me think on it, I just got nervous
Let me drink on it, think I just answered yes but not on purpose
I pass the church and do the Father, Son and Holy Spirit
But I'm only near it, man I need to pass the service
I'm drownin cause I'm so tired of treadin
So Lord when you get a second, please

[Chorus]

[Crooked I]
I wake up and my shirt is leakin
Covered in sweat, I'm dreamin of bein murdered when I'm sleepin
Picture a person beefin, with himself and it's even, worse when I'm drinkin
It hurts when I'm thinkin, me versus my personal demons
I'm reachin for my nine
If I point it at myself will it help to quiet the demons screamin in my mind?
And if I go, to the other side
Just tell my mother it was her prayers that kept her young and thuggin son alive
Plus my daughters, them my butterflies
Tell my son that I, love him; tell my nieces and nephews they uncle tried
to take this music to the fuckin peak
But I'm still a drug dealer as we fuckin speak, that's fuckin weak!

[Joe Budden]
Behind the tours and rap fans, hospitals and CAT scans
Shoulder when they call him bi-polar, happiest madman
Don't know my story, my struggle, the demons that I combat
Or how I'm starin at 'em waitin for eye contact, beyond that
I got a soulmate that's naïve, so the thought of me is prison to her
Baby mama that's crazy and a 10-year old who listens to her
My fam and friends think I'm the bank
And the way they keep comin back you'd think I got thanked
To you it's a dream, to me it's labor, these aren't monsters, these my neighbors
And we watch each other's back, I guess it's favor for a favor
Sometimes they even save me when my wrist is to that razor
Say a prayer
