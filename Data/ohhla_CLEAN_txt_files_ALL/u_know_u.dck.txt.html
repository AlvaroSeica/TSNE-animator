[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
Yeah, It's 2007, I'm here
You know I had to go in on this one
This shit is heavy

[Chorus 2X: Inspectah Deck]
Son you know your no G
Word on the street you work for police
Wanna lock horns then what's it gone be
(You can't concur nothin on me)

[Inspectah Deck]
I ride by myself no need for Co-D's
I don't need a cat near me who won't squeeze
My life on the line you gots to hold these
When the heat is on how the hell I'm gone freeze
No I aint a killer, Those who know me
They'll tell you I'm a rebel, Nothin hold me
I'm guided by my soul I strole the cold streets
The wolves outside, I advise you roll deep
But he a hard head, He swear he O.G
Blade to the face to squash this whole beef
No you aint a gangsta cause you hold heat
They knocked you for a body, How'd you go free
You told 5-0 you know who sold E
I hopin you aint tell the poe you know me
Your last name Brasco son then show me
Or you suspect, That's why they killed Cochise
Put out an A.P.B., He don't eat
They throw him a bomb since he wanna go deep
Blow in your face terminate your whole fleet
Set me up to fall I land on both feet, Nigga

[Chorus]

[Outro: Inspectah Deck]
Yeah, This goes, For all them wanna be gangstas
Wanna be thugs, Niggas aint got no criminal records
No rap sheets, Aint never seen the box or the bing
This for yall niggas, You know you no G </pre>
