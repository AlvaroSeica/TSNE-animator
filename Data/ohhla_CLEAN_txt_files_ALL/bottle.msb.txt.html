[Verse 1]
I'm tired of hoes hatin' cause I'm off in the club cuz
they niggaz keep hollerin and showin me love
don't get mad at me girl it ain't my fault
that this fit that I'm fittin see ya boyfriend bought
I paid the cost, but now I'm the boss
and you picked the fight but you see dat you lost
outside of the spot girl lookin cause mess
gettin mad by the second cause I'm lookin the best
I see ya homie and she lookin depressed cuz
my niggaz pourin liquor all over her dress oops!
now she mad girl what you gon do
by the sound and the whispers of her weak ass crew
but ya played into it and you
got stomped out maybe next time you won't open ya got damn mouth
with a timberland logo branded in ya forehead
glass stickin out the side and the color is red

[Chorus]
(I'll hit that bitch with bottle)
I don't fight I don't argue I'll just that bitch with a bottle
(I'll hit that bitch with a bottle)
Call my click don't bother I'll just hit that bitch with a bottle
(I'll hit that bitch with a bottle)
Got problems I'll solve 'em I'll just hit that bitch with a bottle
(I'll hit that bitch with a bottle)

[Verse 2]
Don't get happy security ain't comin for you
we buck we ain't lettin security through, bitch
we ain't playin you goin off in a pit
in the public actin stupid girl throwin up fits
never again you gone live to talk about it
how this ass whoppin make you where you never ever doubt it
I came to party not to fight with you
defending myself is somethin I got a right to do
better get ya shit right before you get stomped out
better yet bottle action and I put ya lights out got
a bad asstemperand I'm dealin with that
my gurl nigga kinda crazy beatin bitches with bats
I'm kinda confused you ain't talkin much now
next time you see me girl you'll be takin a bow
as you see I'm not a kid and I don't play games
my names says it all I'll just take a bottle in hand

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
One heffa
two heffas
three heffas four
hit that bitch with a bottle watch that head hit the floor
cuz I ain't the type a bitch that wanna start alot of shit
askin for the bottle action yo thats what she gon get
don't start no shtit it won't be no shit
hypnotiq, henny,moet yo heffas take yo pick
attitude cause I'm wavy and you walkin around nappy
head bussin bussin bussin like my name was lil scrappy
westside westside till I die
rep Bankhead graduated from Doug High
I'm a vet in this thang bein a part of this game
got my game goin like J. Dupree was my name
everywhere I go I feel the mug a hater
givin 'em much drama to the club i'ma cater
need some controversy i'ma give you somethin to talk about see me bust
a bottle everybody raise ya hands

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
My niggaz blaze that weed
we gon stomp that bitch till she bleed
don't let security through
we gon put her in ICU
cuz I ain't got nothin to loose I'm in control
but I'ma take that ho with no lows
I'll hit that bitch with a bottle
I'll hit that bitch with a bottle
I said my niggaz blaze that weed
we gon stomp that bitch till she bleed
don't let security through
we'll ICU security too and
I ain't got nothin to loose
I'm in control but
I'ma take that ho with no lows
I'll hit that bitch with a bottle
I'll hit that bitch with a bottle
I'll hit that bitch with a bottle!</pre>
