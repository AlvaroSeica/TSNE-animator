[NEUTRINO]
Bound for the bound bound, we're back again
Oxide, Neutrino settin the trend
This time I thought I'd bring in my friends
Mega, Romeo, So solid that's them
Uh oh, uh oh, lemme hear ya
Uh oh, uh oh, a little louder
Uh oh, uh oh, I can't hear ya
Uh oh, uh oh, yeah

[ROMEO]
Its like a skunk smell, tortoise in a shell
Treble the bass, smile with a face
Coffee with a kettle and a pedal with a pusher
With a coffee with a kettle and a pedal with a pusher
Its like a skunk smell, Tortoise in a shell
Treble the bass, smile with a face
Coffee with a kettle and a pedal with a pusher
With the medal, sittin on another level

[LISA MAFFIA]
You're no good for me
I don't need no body
Don't need no one
That's no good for me
You're no good for me
I don't need no body
Don't need no one
That's no good for me

You're no good for me
I don't need no body
Don't need no one
That's no good for me
You're no good for me
I don't need no body
Don't need no one
That's no good for me

[MEGAMAN]
Oops-e daisy-zee
And everyone's going crazy
Dirty dancing, Patrick Swayze-zee
Yeah we can take it easy-zee
Ladies can you feel the flow-flow
Give you the vibe to get up and go-go
Hands in the air, let me know-know
Do you like so solid so-so

I rock all my flow, this time I go
Rock the ground, let them go, Bo
Uh oh, comin to show them where to go
TW7 when we're on a roll
Fly the jumbo we go Mexico
So solid so we bring in the dough
Champagne just to make them irrated
Don't stop, get it get it
