(Chorus - B.G.) [Repeat 2x]
'Cause I'm ridin' on dubs but they hatin' on me
I get alot of love but they hatin' on me
In a Bentley 'round the club but they hatin' on me
Why is everybody playa hatin' on me?

(Verse 1 - Ke'Noe) [B.G.]
When you see me with them rims that keep spinnin' [But they hatin' on me]
33's and we call em' Scottie Pippen's [But they hatin' on me]
Cartier with the tic-tac-toe [But they hatin' on me]
I'm buying cars off the show-room floor [But they hatin' on me]
And I'm dressin' all good from the floor up [But they hatin' on me]
When you see my Lamborghini doors go up [But they hatin' on me]
I gotta crib that you see on MTV [Stop hatin' on me]
Just did a song with Snoop Dogg last week [But they hatin' on me]
'Cause I got your baby momma in my coupe [But they hatin' on me]
And the fans know I got alot of loute [Man they hatin' on me]
'Cause I park my blue bentley on the curb [Even though they hatin' on me]
Went and told my momma I was slangin' birds [But they hatin' on me]
'Cause I'm coppin' new kicks before they come out [But they hatin' on me]
I'm the one that got these ladies all strung out [But they hatin' on me]
"Life As A Mack" about to do a million plus [But they hatin' on me]
My Laboratory Entertainment coming up [Stop hatin' on me] 
We Coming Up

[Chorus]

I be bound if I go to jail [But they hatin' on me]
I got that Lex truck on Sprewell's [But they hatin' on me]
Everything I touch a million sell [But they hatin' on me]
People saying "what's that smell"? [But they hatin' on me]
'Cuzin won't never get well [But they hatin' on me]
Ma's get ya weed in the mail [But they hatin' on me]

After serving ya, how bout a stretcher? [But they hatin' on me]
I guarentee you learn ya lesson [But they hatin' on me]
Fo' you look up, is dooka-bluka 
You hatin'? it's bluka-bluka
Gotta CL-320 [But they hatin' on me]
A E-Class 3 Twin wagon [But they hatin' on me]
I got the jets on a Suzuki [But they hatin' on me]
I'm still the same ol' lil dude

Got you know, head of production [But they hatin' on me]
But you bustaz you gotta love it [But they hatin' on me]

[Chorus]

(Verse 3 - Ke'Noe) [B.G.]
I'm hoppin' out in a throw-back fit [But they hatin' on me]
New Benz and it came with the kit [But they hatin' on me]
My money long like the Mississippi River [But they hatin' on me]
My neck, my wrist, my watch it all glitter [But they hatin' on me]
You know Ke'Noe buying cars, I don't rent [But they hatin' on me]
I don't glist unless 100 g's spent [Oooh they hatin' on me]
But on the streets I'm making beats for B. Gizzle [Stop Hatin!]
And every song that we do is off the hizzle [But they hatin' on me]
E.T. let you know I see you chillin' [But they hatin' on me]
And the world see yo life on how I'm livin' [Man they hatin' on me]
I in the club with the baddest mami' in here [But they hatin' on me]
I got these girls harlem shakin' all in here [But they hatin' on me]
I'm doin' shows for high prices over sea's [But they hatin' on me]
But on the PS I'm going for 10 G's [Man they hatin' on me]
Ya see my pants always sag to the floor [But they hatin' on me]
Be on the lookout for that Ke'Noe car show [Stop hatin' on me]
