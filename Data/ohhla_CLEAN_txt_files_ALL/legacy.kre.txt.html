[Hook]
Ey yo the bare like me, weed like me
Violence and trouble always seem to find me
I don't give a fuck you ain't got it like me
The legacy I leave behind me defines me

[XL]
Motherfuckers can't relate to that, can't escape the facts
Try to rush on by and I take them back
Dead and rose like base and crack, diesel and smack
Long sleeves covering tracks
I run through this wasteland covering both eyes
Than cover my ears and escape the lies
See none of y'all out there can write like this
And none of y'all out there gets nice like this
Can't keep up with me, you ain't corrupted like me
You ain't? like me
None of y'all sip blood from the cup like me
And none of y'all is stuck in the rut like me

[G Square]
People say I'm doing too much, controlling too much
And so what? The truth is I ain't giving a fuck
Spending my change, earning my name, staking my claim
No shame, cuz we don't never do it the same
I start selling thousands, switching my house in
Pay an accountance, get it, them bouncing
Think you all high, we getting higher
Drink ever clear and spit fire, pass out
And crush with blown out tires
You ain't making a sacrifice, giving up half your life
The first to talk and the last to fight
Acting like you gonna see me in the afterlife
On the other side of the glass reading your last rights
I barely get my leg in the door, what you here for?
What you think we do this all these years for?
Don't matter if you don't like me cause more than likely
We gonna make it happen nightly

[Hook] - 2x

"XL" ::scratched out::

[XL]
Check me out, right?
I compose the music real heads wanna hear
On the subway through headphones screaming in your ear
About ten years?
Made a million and a half in stakes and never been wrong
Struggle, find a place where I belong
Turn my back for a second and it's all gone
Family in caskets, my state bordering madness
Many try but can't none of them match this
Along the road I lost control
If it wasn't for my pops I'd have lost my soul
This life I chose takes it's toll
This rap game'll? you up and swallow you whole
One wrong move is all it takes
One wrong bet for all the stakes
These are the brakes
Getting wise while I'm getting older
Sliding by getting payed, the world over

[XL and G Square]
We're on the outside looking in
And I can see through you cause you're paper thin
No more waiting now we're braking in
Making dough, loosing friends no matter how it ends

[G Square]
Definition of a true rap artist for real
Spent twelve years behind two wheels of steel
Get payed without them BMI cheques, record execs
Only tears, bloodshed and sweat
You can keep your advances, I'll take my chances
Till I'm sitting in a Hummer and a mansion
Understand I can't stand to see these motherfuckers ruin it
So trust me when I tell you I'm true to it
Still doing it, still persuing it
Started off new to this thing putting time and still proving it
Players wanna kill you and labels wanna sell you
I came here to help you, listen when I tell you
Bitches don't care if you disappear tomorrow
They jump on the next dick and pop another bottle
Small time drama keep fucking up my time
And I ain't about to let you stop me from shining
