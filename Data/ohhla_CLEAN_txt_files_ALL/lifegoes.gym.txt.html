Song:   Life Goes On
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Let's go!

[Chorus: Oh Land]
Or when the day is gone
Or when the nights are long
Life goes on, life goes on
We gotta live it up 'til it's gone (live it up)
cause we won't be around too long (nah)
Life goes on, life goes on (yeah!)

[Travie McCoy]
Lately it seems the good dreams are few and far between
Nightmares of puttin fires out with gasoline (damn)
And I'm just tryin to stay righteous
Sometimes I see my own face in Christ likeness (yeah)
And apart from my life's vices
Fifteen years young, had my first mid-life crisis (wow)
But it's tough to stay upright and pious
when people you hold highest be the ones the most biased
My daddy told me "misery loves company"
If that's the case they must hate they ain't gettin none from me
I don't sweat it, it's embedded in my DNA
I got a good heart, and Bad Brains, BMA

[Chorus]

[Travie McCoy]
C'mon~! Up late Facebookin playin coulda been and
starin at the empty bed my ex girl shoulda been in (too bad)
Thinkin what I woulda done different
Not a damn thing cause finally I'm done with it (done)
Besides I got a girl that adores me
And I never take for granted all the things she does for me (never)
I shoot the moon down and put it on a wedding band
And sing these songs of mine to her, and she's an Otis Redding fan
And she'll never forget her man
cause she knows she'll never find a better man
Let's go ahead with these wedding plans
Come on, let's sing this song, life goes on

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You take too much for granted
(Too much - we don't want {?} two miles)
I just can't understand it
(Can't understand it - is it really that hard to smile?)
We don't ask, we demand it
(Moves I'm making - it's gone when it's good)
And I'm tryin not to panic
(But you know what they say - life goes on)

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
