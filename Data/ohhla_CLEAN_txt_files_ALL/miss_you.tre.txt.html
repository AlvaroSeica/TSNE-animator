Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro/Chorus 1]
I can't stop missing you
Wish I was there with you
I can't stop missing you
No, no, no, no
I can't stop missing you (no)
Wish I was there with you (with you)
I can't stop missing you
No, no, no, no

[Trey Songz]
I miss the way you kiss
miss the way you wear them heels and make it switch
Miss the way your hair blows in the wind
And I miss you staying here 'til the morning
Miss the way you put on your makeup
Miss the way you love me too much
It's everything about you baby
Wanna know where you been lately
Do you go out?
Do you still live at your old house?
Do you got somebody new in your life?
'cause I can't get you out of my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
And I wanna erase
but I can't stop seein' your face
And every girl I try to replace you with
Why can't I get over it?
Simply cause I can't..

[Chorus 2]
I can't stop missing you (can't stop)
Wish I was there with you (with you)
I can't stop missing you
No, no, no, no
I can't stop missing you (can't stop)
Wish I was there with you (with you)
I can't stop missing you
No, no, no, no

I can't stop..

[Trey Songz]
missing everything you say
missing all the crazy love we made
Why'd you throw it all away?
I want you to know
It's been hell tryna do this without you here
Baby, '07's supposed to be our year
You confront my worst fears
And I had my doubts
every time you was going out
'cause I knew you were telling me lies
and I can't get that outta my mind

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus 2]

[Breakdown]
Wish
I
Could wake up and forget about you
Not try
to call you when I know I want to
(Oh Wish I)
I gotta fight this feeling
(Wish I)
Can't let it take over me
(Wish I)
You just don't understand how much you were a part of me

[Chorus] - 3X
