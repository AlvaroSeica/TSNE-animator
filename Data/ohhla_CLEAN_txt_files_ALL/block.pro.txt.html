Song:   The Block
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Hook: Prodigal Sunn]
The block is real
The block...
The block is real

[Prodigal Sunn]
Fewer street isolation, jakes creep through the hood, interrogating
Life of a three time felon, so blunt, weapons illegal selling
Shouting rebellion, and all I want is smooth sailing
But my fam keep telling me, peep God, it's jealously
I move your majesty, heat-guns, Butch Cassidy, Sundance sweetheart
These leaky pieces wanna get in my pants
I take a chance, see my face in the back of our ambulance
I'm far too advanced, build my kingdom like an army of ants
Bunch of my fam, died in the slums, driving for crumbs
We do a, die where I'm from, til I'm high off this green gum
Where I'm from, exchange a blum for blum
Streets sing a song, but they, won't live long

[Chorus: Prodigal Sunn]
This goes out, to my hustlas on the block, blocks
Cash scrapers, move makers, yo we steam broc'
This goes out, to them hustlas on the block, blocks
Team movers, dream persuers, bonds and stocks
This goes out, to big business behind them cell blocks
Do ya time, free ya mind, keep the diesel rocked
It's still real on the block, block, yo, yo

[Prodigal Sunn]
Since the age of 13, gravy, I knew I was ahead of the game
Now good times in the hood, but I stood like James
Evans, son if you know what I know, you will keep stepping
Or you can taste the flames of these automatic weapons
Blow 'em, I'll blast, Sunzini on the rise at last
Two On Da Road, S.O.M., universal my cash
I fiend you to pass, future present, I roll a desert eagle
The way that I move, every step is residen' lethal
For the days of pop rocks, grab the 32's and 22's
Sippin' Amaretto with jews
Life or death, is the game you choose, so wins or lose
Surrounded, in the slums of guns, cracks and booze
Whose to say, trial or terror, error the game
Machines spray, my son gotta, head for the grave
Scratched out for the block life, living in war
I watch them wiz take off in the poor, poor, poor

[Chorus]

[Prodigal Sunn]
I'm type extreme with the skills, the way I move through the fields
Endangered species in the hood, alotta, blood got spilled
Rest in peace, but never the least, the beast won't cease
Son I'm forced to carry a piece, but I keeps it peace
Just see the game for what it really is, about my kid
Served two bids, popped a few lids, my dudes in this
The streets be a gamble, baby boys playing with ammo
Bubbling samples, running through the jungle like animals
Dying for fortune, another victim lay in the coffin
Your drama, unlike mama love, it's gon' be alright
For every dollar, that we spend, we gotta see it again
Hard times in the ghetto, the evil of men, men

[Chorus]</pre>
