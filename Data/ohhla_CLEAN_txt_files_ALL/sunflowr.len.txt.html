[Intro/Chorus: Lenny Kravitz]
You're... making it feel that everything is alright
You're my, sunflower 
You're my, sunflower
 
[Lenny Kravitz]
In a world that's crumbling, all around us everyday
You are.. all the inspiration that I, need to find my way
How long I've been yearning, for the day I find my one, true love
Now that you are here my darling, I want you to stay 
(I want you to stay)
 
[Chorus]
You're... making it feel that everything is alright
You're my, sunflower 
You're my, sunflower
You're... making it feel that everything is alright
You're my, sunflower 
You're my, sunflower
 
[Lenny Kravitz] 
Whenever you call me, I'll be there with no delay, my love
Even when I'm miles away, girl, my heart will be there (I'll be right there)
Any conversation, that you want to have, you'll have my ear
You can tell me all your secrets, they'll be safe my deaaaar
OHH~!
 
[Chorus]
 
[Drake]
I'm not that good with words, but I'ma, I'ma try my best..
 ...Look 
I don't ever wanna make you mad, girl
I just wanna have a seed
Y'know the things young men are hesitant to have, girl
A lil' you, a lil' me, and someone else: 
Good Lord, that's a winner right there
But we really got a story to tell, I can't finish right there
I used to wonder what my ol' girl doin right now
Ever since you came into my life
Everytime I think it'd be good to call her
I just think about you and it make me think twice, ah yeah
Yeah, I know we've been through a couple things
Y'know a couple things, what are we to do?
Uh, but you make me feel good 
'Cause you love me for me and you love me for you, c'mon
 
[Chorus 2X]</pre>
