Blue jeans, check! Black-T, check!
Record my raps on a cassette tape deck
Wearin' no sweats 'cause Nike owns Chucks
Three rows of studs 'cause hoes wanna fuh-!
Axe to max on my nasty socks
synchronize with a text but I guess I'm blocked
I'd leave voicemail but it would just be mocked
Wake up my mom, dad'd clean my clock!
"Hey, mom, it's me - no need for alarm
Gonna be a party that's the straight-up bomb
Here's your keys and your coat and Louis Vuitton."
She's like, "Uggghhh...," and you know that it's on!
She's gotta do some errands and a couple of chores
drop the videos off, hit the grocery store
"If your gonna be a bitch, trick, get on all fours!"
"If you don't watch that lip, it's goodbye to your porn!"
Word is born, say no worries and we're out in a hurry
I beg for Mickey D's, cold mac a McFlurry
Pulls the Prius into Payless and I start gettin' worried
Turn on the radio, started listning to Journey

Don't start the party with out me!
Say it one more time, but this time say it loudly!
I said don't start the party with out me!
Say it one more time, but this time say it loudly!

I bet there's pot, I never tried it
Bet there's lots, I'm so excited
My first beer, no fear, why fight it?
Hope it's not a problem that I'm not invited!
Got a party jones like I'm a Kennedy
Eleven-fifteen, night was never meant to be
My maternal enemy is sure to be the end of me
She in there buyin' shoes like she a centipede
Next to the pharmacy, I mac on a magazine
Party's thumpin' in my brain, blood throbbin' to the beat
I can see the honey bees while they're breakin' up the trees
shotugn with tongue; that'd be off the heez!
Bitch, please! Not Barnes and Noble!
Clock's tickin', everybody's totaled
By the time I get there, there'll be nobody home
Dont get me started, just get me stoned!

Don't start the party with out me!
Say it one more time, but this time say it loudly!
I said don't start the party with out me!
Say it one more time, but this time say it loudly!

PARTY!
...Without me..

CVS, Payless, Barnes and Blockbuster
Hit by tear gas made of minimall mustard
Buyin' tampons, rentin' Prince of Tides
Grease 2, and Just One of the Guys
One hell of a night, one hell of a ride
If you're not allowed to drive, gotta empathize
I'm way in the back, prayin', "Jesus, please!"
Watchin' Dora the Explorer on the DVD
and why didn't we hit the party in the first place?
"'Cause I don't want my son gettin' shit-faced!"
I did a spit take, it's almost midnight
keg's tapped, no fun, no fist fights
Goodnight, goodbye, sweet Bacchanal
that was somewhere in the condos by the shopping mall
She's says I'm too young for beer and drugs
"Maybe when you're grown up, you can go and get crunk."

Don't start the party with out me!
Say it one more time, but this time say it loudly!
I said don't start the party with out me!
Say it one more time, but this time say it loudly!
Don't start the party with out me!
Say it one more time, but this time say it loudly!
I said don't start the party with out me!
Say it one more time, but this time say it loudly!

PARTY!
...Without me..
PARTY!
...Without me..
PARTY!
...Without me..
PARTY!
...Without me..</pre>
