[chorus] {:13}
run up in your crib, where you live, let you die
put you one in the bed home-vade
duct tape your whole body to you ankles to your wrists
to your mouth so you cant say shit
{repeat}
then they wanna get cut with the glass
fuck around a nigga have to hide they ass
never wanna mess around like that
fuck around a nigga have to hide they ass
then they wanna get cut with the glass
fuck around a nigga have to hide they ass
shit themselves get pimped with the glass
fuck around a nigga have to hide they ass

[verse one] {:40}
well mack you know when the jack
the jack be rippin the scraps
step aside while i spit at these cats
the rippity raps, never been a thing to me
see the fame that it bring to me
be the nigga with the grains on the napkin
limpin in the land with the hand on the tech
chillin with my niggas with the hand on mowett
raw dawg, up in the spot
with two fings and we fill 'em with rocks
still in the spot, a hatter wanna test
introducing the glocks
gettin close to the two when we pop
the moodier drops
screamin with shots, blood oozie and drops
got in the fuckin lou of the spot
you know how we play
gettin head on the freeway
closin deals on the three-way
how many niggas you know, could get dough and pimp a hoe
but never give a fuck what a freak say
bitch come on!

[chorus] (repeat) {1:08}

[verse two] {1:35}
i'm the same motherfucker that played with it
yeah i admit it, i did it, i split 'em
if i gotta do it again then i kill 'em
same dealin straight killin cap pealin
for those illin i'd amaze ya and do dealin
now who realin suicide for the true-izm
i got two thug niggas with two dealins
and two more choppers in the house chillin
and if you feelin that you really can fade this
i got a room of guns, bigger like the matrix
it aint no fake shit nigga in the basement
straight formulatin, all the world's hatin
nobody go thru to do what ya nigga do
now ya gotta pay ya due, listen to another fool
i run with all ya crew baby gotta kill 'em too
it ain't no mercy when ya fuckin with a nigga juice
that go for you and you and niggas that dont know too
come bigger things, if i need to rip you
ya betta hope that day dont hit you
cuz ya wife goan be bit fuckin wit a nigga shit
tryin ta hide all day when i catch you thats it
and it wont be long till i get to ya bitch
now ya think im wrong, cuz i kick now da bitch

[chorus] (repeat) {2:16}

[verse three] {2:43}
what it is another full sized identity?

you mean to tell me somebody wanna finish me?
you got the tendancy missin and want to envy me
me 'na been coughin' shit get foul
fucked around the k's got me shot in a while
niggas don't want they bodies chopped like steak
cut with the k ya betta move out the way
and when the k's get to cut cut cuttin all of a sudden
it feel like the president done pushed the button
niggas wanna got to war?
where ya gats at?
nigga where ya sacks at?
niggas back back, raise a nigga up that
clack clack, and i wanna finish some set, skat skat
and y'all don't want none of that, at at

ima as much done safe this year
one more time, 99 ain't here
what the kid really come wit?
comin with the dumb shit ima bring out over here
i got one to drop them big guns
and 'a duct tape for your mouth and waist
wrap ya whole body ain't nothin you can say
put you in a glad bag, throw your ass away
niggas got nuts they be keep 'em in line
smile in my face, steady backin' my rhyme
i tear your head up, on ser'ous but mine
how you fittin' cryin you remind the time
it look like a nigga got cut with glass
fuck around a nigga have to hide your ass
run up in your crib bare face no mask
fuck around a nigga have to hide that ass!
