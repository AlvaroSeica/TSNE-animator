[Chorus 2X: Prodigal Sunn samples]
"Don't don't don't don't don't
Don't get puzzled from the words I spill"
	"I'll let you know"
"D-DJ" "Where you gon' run to"
"Don't get puzzled from the words I spill"
	"I'll let 'em know"
"D-DJ" "Sunn'll turn face"

[Prodigal Sunn]
The gun of a slave, condensed prince, crowns and kings
The face of a pharoah, escapin' the American dream
They say it's all about the time and the themes
So I takes my time, create design, intellectual blind
Tore my heart, body and soul, as I run through the globe
Teachin' the babies, the young and the old livin' in this cold world
Some play for better days and better ways
Wise words from my grandpa; lay low when that beretta sprays
Got only one life to live, choose positive over negative
You know the game is mad competitive
To all my kin folks and relatives
Open your eyes, to the lies, real lines, go wake and suit up

[Chorus 2X]

[Prodigal Sunn]
It all started 29 hard, verse with a spark, then lay it marv'
Reign of the star, the Sunn, I grew my arms Dubar
Endangered species, run the city of lust, greed and envy
Piece hangin' from your chest, diamond crest, don't tempt me
Since a young shorty, move with the force of a horse
Main ingredient to my line source, full meal course
Never known to deal with the soft, cuz the real, we comin' off
Long term like the floor scout, scrapers and lofts
My Uncle Ray used to say; boy, eat to live
No food in the crib, stomach down, and touchin' my ribs
Foodstamp kid, first bid, age 12; juvenile skid
For scappin' a pillar, money guerilla
Runnin' wild through the 'Nam com, weapon concealer
Became wise to the fact that only God delivers
Still remember Grandma Miller, rockin' chinchilla's
'83, out in A.C., with Grandpa Skrilla

[Chorus 2X]

[Prodigal Sunn]
I set a scene that causes heart attacks
Smoother than the scale on a shark's back
We smarter than your average cat, as a matter of a fact
Ready for any savage with gats
Bag that, you'll get head cracked, lay dead flat
Grown in these streets, plus killas needed weed over meat
Survival depends, ascends on your style and technique
Political muscle, rather do venetical structure
In a Jetta, go horetical, blood of a hustla
In gold chains, before they put us in chains
Hit us with the crack cocaine
Watch the junkies shootin' smack in they veins
From Lennox to Lewis, convinced we can do this
Always knew this, heavyweight champ
Bang with the force, of forty amps
Yeah, that's just the way it is, knowledge my biz
Self employed, big boy toys, enjoy, my kids, for real
For real, life is not a game son, you better know it's real, real

[Chorus 4X]

[Outro: Prodigal Sunn]
It's all about surival, baby
It's alot of sharks in the pool, man
Straight up, I see you sleep, boy
Stay away from affections
I know the game, baby, yeah, yeah
We know the game', baby
Don't get puzzled from the words I spill
That shit is real, real, you know the drill, real
Real, real</pre>
