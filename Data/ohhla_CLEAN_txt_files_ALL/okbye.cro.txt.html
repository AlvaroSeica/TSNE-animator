[Intro: Crooked I]
California!
You're now rockin with the motherfuckin best
Crooked I

[Crooked I]
You don't like how I live, okay bye
You don't like gettin money, okay, bye
You don't like bad chicks, okay bye
Now go that-a-way, go that-a-way
The world hatin on your boy just yesterday
But like I said, that was yesterday
Cause AY!

Eminem signed me to Shady, put me on Interscope
Then he gave me a rifle so I could put you in a scope
Gave me the stamp, put the check in the mail
Now chicks lickin me like a envelope; yeah I'm in her throat
Crooked about to score, I see the red zone
All I need is +Beats by Dre+, but not the headphones
Think I don't live right, homie you dead wrong
Submarine sandwich, I'm just sayin my bread long
Walk in the club with a gang of East Siders
Some rappers cool, I came to be live-er
You claim to be lighters - you say you spit flame
You a liar; damn dawg, change your speech writer
Uh, I'm sideways on a hater, keep it pushin
Just another Massengill pussy who need a douchin
I'm lookin for a round ass, I need a cushion
I love it when they tell me, "Daddy I need a whoopin!"

[Chorus: Crooked I]
You don't like how I live, okay bye
You don't like gettin money, okay bye
You don't like bad chicks, okay bye
Now go that-a-way, go that-a-way
You don't like how I do it, okay bye
You don't like that I'm hood, okay bye
You don't like that I'm me, okay bye
Now go that-a-way, go that-a-way

[Crooked I]
Homie, I'll be keepin it real because I am real
Yeah, some of y'all eatin good but it's your last meal
You the king of the hill but it's an ant hill
I kick it over, you over, tell me how that feel
It's not a arrogant thing - I got a stable of lyrics
And I'll be pimpin this pen, like Sean Garrett and Dream
If these songs was hoes I'll have a harem like a Arabic king
So beware of my team, yep!
So many wolves you ain't got nothin for me
Nowadays all that champagne poppin be lookin corny
We got the bitches on Hennessy gettin horny
And they ain't thinkin of leavin 'til 6 in the mornin
Yeah, they love fuckin with us
Let 'em do what they do, you be cuffin them tough
See you Greyhound luggage when it come to the sluts
Huh, cause they gon' throw you under the bus, but

[Chorus]

[Crooked I]
As long as I hustle hard money gon' come with ease
And it's +Child's Play+, call it +Chucky Cheese+
Wanna do it like me? Go sell a couple ki's
and a ton of weed then run the street with a hundred G's
Goons that is, they comin out the woodwork
I would work, but that ain't how the hood work
I'm tryin to take over the game Big and 'Pac style
Labels tryin to drop my old shit cause I'm hot now (hot now)
But oh shit! You should stop now
Try to play me on some hoe shit I'll shut your block down
Dirty magazines tell you what my clique 'bout
Cause +Playboy+ we some +Hustlers+ in a +Penthouse+
Louie bag full of paper, let my chick count
She flyer than a double somersault dismount
And she swear to God Crooked gon' dog her out
I got a bad rep, cause I'm from SLAUGHTERHOUSE!

[Chorus]</pre>
