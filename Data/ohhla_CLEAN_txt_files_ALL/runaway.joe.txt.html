[Joe Budden]
Uh, I said all that I'll say, so I stand with no apologies
I've popped all that I popped, wasn't too recently that it got to me
Those of y'all that love Joe, got to admit the shit was a lot to see
Today I take all of the credit like I did away with modesty
I lost weight, lost faith, I got caught up in that vacuum
My stomach turned and my eyes burned and I became best friends with the bathroom
Today it takes all the strength I have inside for me to avoid the rush
Face pokered over the toilet, all you hear is a royal flush
Was under control, though they warned me about addiction
Mind manifested again in the form of a prescription (talk to 'em)
And it's funny what the affects of that little pill'll do
Funny shit that keeps you alive could also kill you
But it's my life, guess I'm stuck in it
Sometimes I wan' just be normal like them other kids
The demon I battle with every night is simply drugs and shit
But I'll runaway from it all if God deems that I've had enough of it

[Chorus]
They said don't get lost, follow the leader
And don't do that, be a believer
When the sun goes down, you better hide
It's a dangerous world, better stay inside
And, run along, run along
It's a long long way home from here
Run along, run along
It's a long long way home from here

[Joe Budden]
Uhh, it go, look
How come they could roll? Y'all tell me how come they could smoke, they could drink?
They get to do whatever they want and it don't interrupt the way they think
They all get to be regular, why is it only me that's odd?
Me who can't even stand up straight, me who can't even keep a job
Maybe I'm askin for too much, a tiny piece of normalcy
Or an answer to any one of my FUCKIN prayers that's askin what's wrong with me
Maybe I'm tired of bein unique, tired of bein that outcast
I'm tired of me bein the only one, so tired of y'all not knowin about that
I'm tired of it all, want me to fall a spectacle, for the crowd to see
Or bein the only one with faith, I'm tired of e'rybody doubtin me
I'm tired of respondin to grown-ass folks that think so muh'fuckin childishly
Aches, wish I could take my parents' genes the FUCK up out of me
Tired of wantin to run somewhere, tired of havin to bear it all
Tired of you FUCKS constantly takin from me and I'm willin to share it all
Tired of bein objective (uh) I'm tired of havin to hear it all
But bein alone's the only way I know to never be near it all

[Chorus]</pre>
