[Vents]
Now, I heard the weak die young
So fe-fi-fum, here I come
The river runs red with your blood little one
Filling my lungs, Trials just playing with drums
is like kids in the cabinet playing with guns
Waking up in a plywood bed
Life is pain and goes fast like Minor Threat
Gone belly up, pear-shaped, land on your knees
Nobody helps, bank stamp on the fees
Please, Santa Claus' not coming
Your son got his head kicked in friday night for nothing
Left with a bubble in his brain
Speech impediment, I guess he won't bother them again
Singing in the rain, yelling at the sky
Easier than trying to cry, I wonder why
do good things happen to bad men?
And stop trying to tell me that things were much better back then
Come on~!

[Chorus]
Sick of waking up feeling like stress
Tired of waking up feeling depressed
I'm tired of work hard, get your foot in the door
Get it slammed in your face, you could put in a form
I'm sick of waking up feeling alone
No girls that wanna touch me, up on the phone
I'm tired of hearing you say God give a fuck about me
So what about me? Where's God now?

[Sesta]
On a pale blue dot, what the fuck are the chances?
Ha, the beast's living, now he's swinging on branches
But he need obedience, the voice of the master
cause he's gonna panic if he don't get an answer
But disaster struck, it's gotta be him
And I think he pretty mad, so what the fuck do I bring?
Well my brother don't believe him, I'll just send him and his people
and there's gonna be a million of them, it's gonna be grim
Just a genocide, such a shame
to love the same dumb thing in a different way
Sing hymns on a different day
But quick to point the finger at the same and say he's fucking insane
It's only man that will walk among us
But they will kill for what you can't see living above us
Don't throw your hands up, nobody cares
But throw your hands in the air now cause nobody's there, ohhhh

[Chorus]

[Vents]
Unforgettable wars
Staying the course, terrible thoughts
Born with cerebral palsy, his parents divorced
Born with unbearable disease
Cancer in the air and paedophile priests walking free
Talk to me, everything is turning blue
Nobody care, nobody's there for you
Got a taste for the drink and cannabis
Grandfather hit with a stroke and a harsh paralysis
Famine is in the east
Little girls with the HIV, they pray nightly
And madness stays by me
Psychosis and anger till the day I leave
Cronulla Beach, they bashing 'em up
Australia First, the National Front
But I'd rather feel like shit than be full of shit
and feel the pain that you put up with
Come on~!

[Chorus: 2X]</pre>
