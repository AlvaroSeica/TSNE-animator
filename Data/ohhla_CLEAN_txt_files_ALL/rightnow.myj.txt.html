You ever think that we live on the planet?

..

Fly.. with.. me..
Mid-night breeze.. over trees..
Breathe.. emancipation of your mind
Liquidation, incrimination of a, false nation
Two thousand millenium occupation black poet on the run
Track translation information dictation wasting masons
Lacing the world with, pseudo-supremacy
Alien residency, blue collar presentry
Wu-Tang inhumane two thousand chinks came since 1840 main!
Objective being selective on Earth's precious metals
Stealing newborns out the ghetto, who knew?
People thought it was voodoo, ? ? ?
The bright shiny ass catapults to Earth, hittin the gas tractor
with a blast exploding Earthward fear
Knowing we're not the only ones out.. there
1998 we see clear reception on your TV, able
to see any place any time cave, lines and four lines
In a hundred years time we invented the impossible
Orson Welles gospel hostile times lay near
The album 2004 video camera digital, that sucks.. humans in
Experiment on - Do you know the the fundamentals of a phone
How many motherfuckin miles away, still bug your ass at home?
While you listen to your favorite CD, do we SEE
The magic, or does it brainwash us
Feeble, surprised when the alien weevil, soaks our head
with A-1 sauce, when you asleep needle, in your neck
Trying to figure out what the heck you gonna do now?

(Man get down off my damn bed, what the hell is wrong with you?)

Right now.. (3X)
Do you see, what's goin on?
Right now..

To say they harass me is just to say the least
Police and mo' money disturb me in my sleep
Very unclever ways to get paid by lucky, government detectives
and agencies they hunt me, so funny how I never thought
credit would just slump me, scratch that bank account
No chance of me stackin, I'm livin out my pockets
Spending on a trophy, thinkin how they laughin
Saying, "Damn he owe us money," talk BULLshit
Walkin these thoughts through Central Park
Trying to get these records off, mashin through the dark
Ages of the populous, popular we ain't
Officers sent up with fresh paint, or new shit
Just tracks getting ripped
And reputations built like spots, when, you turn around
and the shit's a fucking highrise, building longevity
Sky's the only limit, _Destiny is Success_ like a tape
tossed at cannibus duck, the univited come
with scorching heat seeking out, leaking out to the rap books
of those who peep it out, and buy it

Right now..
Do you see do you see, what's goin on?
Right now..
Do you see do you see, what's goin on?
Right now..
Do you see see, what's goin on?
Right now..

Parent thee I create in the state of open-mindedness
Hopin you findin this to be the finest, timeless
piece of clockwork to emerge on the verge of nabbing
your attention grabbing due respect, it's true so check
out the background we put it down to fat sound acknowledge
greatness in solid, shapeless form, expression performed
Discretion, for more to be advised
We utilize controversy, forever at the mercy of none
First we be done, now you see the motion set forth
by devotion to the sport that I'm coaching
When the whistle blows intial flows stun you
Really just a young crew havin fun too, we ready to run through
This industry offending me on the daily
Knowing that my talent comes as often as a comet named ...
Baby feel the blanking, cause everyone's an emcee RIGHT NOW
despite style.. cracking a tight smile
Greasing palms, each embalmed with bullshit
Who'll get never past the present, disappear when I rule this

Can you see it?</pre>
