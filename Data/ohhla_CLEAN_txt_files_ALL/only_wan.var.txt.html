[Verse 1 - Elle Varner]
Thought you were just another Ro-meo
The shoe ya pass by in the store, window
But soon as I got home I wished I bought you instead
I got it bad, I'll take the black, take the navy and red
No other man has ever, ever had quite this effect
I sleep alone 'cause there's no room in my bed
For any other lover, with no gun to my head
Your kisses hold me hostage and I don't wanna stop it

[Chorus - Elle Varner]
'Cause I only wanna give it to you
And I want you more than a new pair of shoes
I only wanna give it to you
And I sure do hope that ya feel like I do

[Verse 2 - Elle Varner]
I came before this digital ocean
Where folks only move in digital motion
But you're so classic I want you more than my Adidas
All the bees are gettin at you 'cause your honey is sweeter
I need ya, with no gun to my head
Your kisses hold me hostage and I don't wanna stop it

[Chorus]

[Break - Elle Varner]
Can't let this go
What can I say? I just don't know
My love ain't no trip for the weekend, here to stay for all of the seasons
You're the weakness that I can't control

[Verse 3 - J. Cole]
Baby you all I need to get by
You fly, so you all I need to get high
You got it? Uh, so put ya number in this camera phone
And we can live like the camera's on
No script though
These boys claimin they ball, got no grip though
My flow switch mode, it's so schizo
So I'm the one that your girl blow kiss for
Ya gotta love me, Cold World, no snuggie
Baddest girls hug me, my mind on you though
You hopin I'm the one but I already knew though
Uh, it ain't no secret that I get around, true
But girl, ya make me wanna settle down, with you
Get a crib with a view, lay up in the bed, make a kid, maybe two
All my ex-girlfriends gon' have to get a clue
'Cause the rumors that ya heard about is true
(I said I only wanna give it to you)

[Chorus] - 2X - w/ variations and ad libs until the end</pre>
