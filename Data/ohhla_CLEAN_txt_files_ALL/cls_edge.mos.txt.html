[Mos Def]
Pull up to ya spot on low
Shine brighter than all o' them cats they got on glow
Layin the cut like they not gon' know
Cuz if I gotta make a move dawg they not gonna know
This door marked private this is not fo' sho'
It's Mos Def what you call real fo' sho'
Is they what you call gangsta, hell no
They get a lil' pitch and go snitch to the po'
They all talk fast and they all think slow
I'm Mos Definite, not think so
Flood ya city with the black ink flow
And my crew ain't scared to let them things go
So, stop with the nonsense, like he conscious
I'm just awake dog, I'm doing great dog
I don't play games so I don't playa hate y'all
Get it straight or get the fuck up out my face dawg
I'm like the second plane that made the tower's face off
That shit that let you know it's really not a game dawg
Your grind and my grind ain't the same dog
I'm the catalogue, you the same song
So cool and ol' school like eighty-four
The one your little mami windin up her waist for
The name that real niggaz got they hands raised for
Me and Mini got ya block yellow taped off

Don't push me (get off)
'Cuz I'm close - To the streets
to the beach, the bitches, the niggaz
the women, the children, the workers
the killers, the addicts, the dealers
the quiet, the livest, the realest
- And that's close

Don't push me, cuz I'm close
To the edge, back, middle, and front
Strong back shit liftin' it up
From the big and the small
I'm like J. Brown +Gettin' Involved+

But when I'm lettin' off around don't get in the cross
Have ya preacher man speakin' low gettin' his cross
Tell 'em wild cowboy not to get off they horse
Before they find out the tailon is strictly enforced
It's a real bad way to get ya name in the Source
Testin' the limits of a dangerous force
You ended up young famous and gone
Your people shoutin' out ya name in they song
Pourin' liquor on the day you was born
Buyin paint to put your face on a wall
C'mon fall back, there's no need for all that
It's all good, we all here, goin' all out (all out)
All day, listen when this song say

Don't push me 'cuz I'm close - To the streets
to the beach, the bitches, the niggaz
the women, the children, the workers
the killers, the addicts, the dealers
the quiet, the livest, the realest
- And that's close

Don't push me, cuz I'm close
To the edge, back, middle, and front
Strong back shit liftin' it up
From the big and the small
I'm like J. Brown +Gettin' Involved+
Now get yours
