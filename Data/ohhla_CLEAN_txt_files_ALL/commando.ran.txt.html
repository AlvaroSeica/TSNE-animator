[Intro/Chorus]
When Ran flow, more like a Commando
Every ammo warpaint camou'
Who the man yo? Too hot to handle
Every box, every state, every channel

[Random]
Let's have a toast to the most prolific on both coasts
Roast folks you say dope, all you slowpokes
Y'all don't know? Then consider yourself warned
I knock like a hailstorm, somehow he held on
Are you the biggest loser? Then we spittin Rugers
I'ma stick it to you - pause, nah
I'ma give it to you no sales tax
I never was held back, I never did sell crack
I deliver like a Phil Postino
Mucho gusto, you still poquito
Begin yo, in yo' grill like a BBQ
A couple things you never seen me do
And I hope you fall off; sell out my man for a buck?
I fear what'll be in the cup
Sound systems'll be amuck, jettin to buck
Word is +Bond+ I put it on "The World Is Not Enough"

[Chorus] - 2X

[Random]
I take any avenue to batter you
Change up your attitude, my style is shatterproof
Show throwin thorns is hopeless, like panties with holes in it
I'm still splitted; I'll bring a stack but I won't spend it
I don't ride the beat, I'm tryin to ghost whip it
Dude in the sky, you tryin to make rain?
Man the whole game's whack and the economy's lame
At the same time, I'm a great mind
Don't ask for much - I just take mine; Russell Crowe
Untouchable, and my rhymes is the Bombay
You on MySpace, up in your mom's place
You a light snack~! I did it non-drink
Do not play, I'm "Amazing," Kanye
I go back like an Etch-a-Sketch, Erector Set
My sense is reckless, forget your necklace
The head or canal that got a death wish
Flip your style, you was then, this is now
Never been an artist
A Little Mac so I always ran in to beat the Bull charges
Applaud this, ill regardless
Meditation department, takin out the garbage
Cock the buster back, you in my target
Let it rip, come equipped with the rawness
Stock price plummet and close the market

[Chorus] - 4X</pre>
