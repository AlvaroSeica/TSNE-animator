[Fergie]
Love, through the trees, past the sky
Beyond the Northern lights
You will see, my delight
Reflecting in your eyes
And I won't let go, if you wait for me
Whenever, whatever
And then youuuuuu, select the day, selection
Whatever, whenever
And we'll gooooooooooooo
Whatever, whenever
And we'll gooooooooooooooo

[Chorus: will.i.am]
I want, I want, I wanna
love forever, love forever, baby
Wherever, wherever you wanna go (oh one day)
To do whatever, do whatever baby
Wherever, wherever, forever together

[Fergie]
I fell asleep, don't know why
You let me come alive
You and me, we collide
Ignite the starry fire
And you warm me up, and you wait for it
Whenever, whatever
And then youuuuuu, you wake me up, and you wait for it
Whenever, whatever
I wanna gooooooooooooooo
Whatever, whenever
I wanna gooooooooooooooooo
Whatever, whenever

[Chorus]

[will.i.am]
Wherever, whatever, whatever, whatever
Whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever
I love you forever, and ever, and always I love you
Whenever, you need me, I'll be right there by you
Whenever, you call me, I'm there when you call
Whenever, you're fallin, I'm there when you fall
Wherever, you goin, I'll be right there showin
Our love's always growin and growin and growin
I know that you knowin, there's no need for guessin
When I am requested, I'm there with no questions asked
I'll go, wherever, whenever
If ever, you need me
I'll be here, forever</pre>
