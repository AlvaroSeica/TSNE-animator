Song:   Speakin' In French
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Voulez-vous couche avec moi?
Voulez-vous couche avec moi?
I'll make you say

'Cause you're so pretty in the face
Got me in a daze
I gotta get you home
Cause I want you bad
I've been waiting all day
So let me get a taste
Gonna feel so good that
I'll have you speaking in French

Voulez-vous couche avec moi?
Speaking in French
[repeats]
Voulez-vous couche avec moi, ce soir?

She got me speaking French without any translator
Just like I got her cummin' without any vibrator
She said she is in love with my American accent
But not nearly as much as I am in love with her foreign assets
I am talking asses rated GGP in the sex room gettin ludacris DTP
My tongue, crasinates, gucci mane on figure skates than I break you with my dick mixin with martin gates
I dick it down while I give her anal sex
Got her bragging like DJ Khaled screaming we the best
The best we are she is my little shine star
I am just strumming on the bridge like a fucking guitar

'Cause you're so pretty in the face
Got me in a daze
I gotta get you home
Cause I want you bad
I've been waiting all day
So let me get a taste
Gonna feel so good that
I'll have you speaking in French

Voulez-vous couche avec moi?
Speaking in French
[repeats]
Voulez-vous couche avec moi, ce soir?

It's been a year my dear since our last arrangement
Time apart the distance plus sexual estrangement
Needless to say that we've been fighting a lot
But make up sex is the best and we've been making up a lot
I kiss your neck just my hand improvise
whisper in your ear and watch them pretty goose bumps rise
slow motion seduction I aim to please
got you bitin your lip quiverin hips and trembling knees
She tell me to speed it up
The song tells me to slow it down
She hops on top for control
While she pins me down to the ground
She whispers something in French
Something i can't comprehend
Something about me and her and playing this song again

'Cause you're so pretty in the face
Got me in a daze
I gotta get you home
Cause I want you bad
I've been waiting all day
So let me get a taste
Gonna feel so good that
I'll have you speaking in French

Voulez-vous couche avec moi?
Speaking in French
[repeats]
Voulez-vous couche avec moi, ce soir?</pre>
