Uh, uh, It's the Roc in the building

Aami kari na kisi day nal pyar
Mundian to bach ke rahi

[Jay-Z]
Soon as the beat drop we got the streets locked
Overseas with Punjabi MC and the Roc
I came to see the mamis in the spot
On the count of three drop your body like it's hot
1, Young, 2, you, want, to, 3
Young Hov's a snake charmer, move your body like a snake mama
Make me wanna put the snake on ya
I'm on my 8th summer, still hot Young's the 8th wonder
All I do is get bread, yeah I take Wonder
I take one of your chics straight from under your armpit
The black Brad Pitt, I mack 'til six in the AM
All day I'm P-I-M-P, I am simply
Attached to the track like symphony
It's simply good, Young Hov, infinitely hood

[Punjabi MC]
Kari na kisi day nal pyar
Mundian to bach ke rahi
Nhi to hunay hunay hoeyi mutyar
Mundian to bach ke rahi
Nhi to hunay hunay hoeyi mutayar
Mundian to bach ke rahi-oye

[Jay-Z (over Punjabi MC verse)]
R.O.C, and you don't stop
Punjabi MC, and you don't stop
Nigga NYC and we don't stop
It's the Roc, it's the Roc

R.O.C, and we don't stop
Punjabi MC, and we don't stop
It's ya boy Jay-Z, and we don't stop
Nigga R.O.C, and we won't stop

[Punjabi MC]
Tera ki kasoor jun nashen nal hon gayai
Sikh ki adama shermeley nal hon gayai
Tera ki kasoor jun nashen nal hon gayai
Sikh ki adama shermeley nal hon gayai
Sam ke rakh niye jobney puntali
Sam ke rakh niye jobney puntali
Hun murkay nu aunye pahar
Mundian to bach ke rahi

[Jay-Z (over Punjabi MC verse)]
Aha

Bounce, bounce, yes
Uh, uh, uh, uh, yes

[Jay-Z]
Ma, I ain't gotta tell you but it's ya boy Hov
From the U.S., you just, lay down slow
Catch ya boy minglin' in England, nettlin' in the Netherlands
Checkin' in daily under aliases
We rebellious, we back home, screamin' leave Iraq alone
But all my soldiers in the field, I will wish you safe return
But only love kills war when will they learn
It's international Hov, I been havin' the flow
Before Bin Laden got Manhattan to blow
Before Ronald Reagan got Manhattan to blow
Before I was cappin' it then back before
Before we had it all day, poppin' in the hallway
Cop one offa someone to give you more yey
Yea, but that's another stor-ay
But for now mami turn it around and let the boy play (Jay)

[Punjabi MC]
Gora gora rang uthay mil jandi thor
Hun teri jaisi soni koeyi nal
Mundian tho bach ke rahi
Nhi to hunay hunay hoeyi mutyar
Mundian to bach ke rahi
Nhi to hunay hunay hoeyi mutyar
Mundian to bach ke rahi-oye

[Jay-Z (over Punjabi MC verse)]

Mundian ta bullo ta teriya kahania
Chani nhi pathul di galiya bishania
Kopara de bullo ta teria kahania
Chani nhi pathul di galiya bishania
Ranjua ta huya tera roop da deewana
Ranjua ta huya tera roop da deewana
Chal sukhia na hus dabar
Mundian to bach ke rahi
Nhi to hunay hunay hoeyi mutyar
Mundian to bach ke rahi
Nhi to hunay hunay hoeyi mutyar
Mundian to bach ke rahi-oye</pre>
