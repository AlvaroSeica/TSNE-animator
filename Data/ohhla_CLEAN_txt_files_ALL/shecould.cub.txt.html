[Doughboy]
California Air!
Chain all blue like it's runnin out of air
I keep a bad bitch with a fat derriere
And you know that hoe fresher than a new pair
Retro elevens on the pedal!
I'm takin this to the next level
Competition best not show up in a Chevelle
And if you niggaz still wanna make a deal with the devil
I can help you meet him, introduce you to my barrel (to my barrel)
All you artists walkin 'round wit'cha wack raps (wack raps)
and gettin fucked by the game - Kat Stacks (Kat Stacks)
And any nigga thinkin he can make it happen
I'll be outside of Staples with the bitches and the Phantom
Muh'fuker

[Chorus]

[OMG]
Pull up on them bitches, steppin out on thirty inches
In my L.A. Dodger fitted with some Louie V stichin
Niggaz wanna catch me slippin yeah they prayin and they wishin
Cause a nigga clockin dough - and I'm fuckin all they bitches
(Yo you fuckin all they bitches?) Yeah I'm fuckin all they bitches
And it's money over bitches and I'm preachin my religion
Cause this game that I'm livin 'bout as cold as my wrist is
If you know my pops then you know I'm 'bout the business!
Some big trees (big trees) Christmas (Christmas)
Chain super sick (super sick) sickless
My flow retarded nigga (retarded nigga) gifted (gifted)
This game's a bitch, watch me pimp it

[Chorus]

[over second X] - "She had to!"
[over fourth X] - "What about me?"

[Ice Cube]
If you don't kick it with me who you gon' kick it with?
Ice Cube is the shit, who you been speakin with?
They been lyin to you if they told you diff-er-ent
I got a diff-er-ent cool type of tempera-ment
West Coast style baby on some California shit
They mighta told you that, I was hard on a bitch
You know how it go, some bitches think they slick
Look at me and think they 'bout to get rich
Uh-oh (uh-oh) danger~! (Danger~!)
You are (you are) a stranger
Who am I? I am, The Lone Ranger
Tonto tell 'em, I'll run yo' fuckin ass through the ranger
It goes

[Chorus]

[Outro]
What about me? {*3X to fade*}</pre>
