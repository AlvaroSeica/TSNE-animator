[MC Magic]
Oooh
Can I run away with you
I wanna get Lost In Love, baby
To all those pretty girls (Pretty girls)
This one's for you (This one's for you)
Check this out

Chorus: MC Magic
Something about you, baby (Something about, you)
Drives, me, crazy
Something about this pretty girl
Blows, my, mind (Blows my mind)
Something about you, baby
Drives, me, crazy
Something about this pretty girl
Blows, my, mind

[Verse 1: MC Magic]
Si tu supieras lo que siento
Cada vez
Que me pongo a pensar en todos los momentos
All the good times we've had, me and you, you and I
Hot summer nights, making love in July
The only girl that didn't give it on the first night
Una mujer incomparable, I'm a love her life
Me captivaste with your ways and all the things you do (I wanna love you)
My pretty girl
I gotta make it work with you
Tell the world, tell your girls, and your family
Con esto a mio, te prometo, you're my everything (World, girls and your family)
Cause nobody's ever made me feel the way you do
I just dropped you off
Already miss you
Chica bonita, sonrisa, sincera
I wanna be with you hasta que me muerda (Forever)
Let's make a pact
And always be together
With you by my side, girl, I'm down for whatever (Always, always)

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: Zig Zag {MC Magic in background}]
You still
Out from your crew
From across the room
I had to keep, my attention on you
So
About that
Pretty face, that pretty smile
You couldn't help but to get lost in those pretty eyes
Yeah, this girl, she had it all (Yeah)
The type of woman that you
Take to mother
Sayin' "Look what I found?"
Love and companionship
Someone to talk
Through these rough times (Yeah)
Who ain't afraid to handle it
And understands that my life is different
And accepts it
This isn't what I expected
Yeah, she beautiful
Inside and out
Somethin' hard to find
In the world today {In the world today}
Even in my worst day
Heh ha
She's got me happy
Like a kid, wakin' up on his birthday {I can never find another girl like you}
Yeah; this love was different, it was based on friendship
I'm letting you down (Come on)
I'm ready to ride out with it

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: Dos]
What's up, little shorty, can we talk for a minute?
I been havin' dreams, and you bein' all up on 'em
I know you don't know me, I seen you around
You're the hottest lookin' honey that I seen in this town
Come on, let's conversate
Take a walk, get together
Just wanna know you a little bit better
Beauty incomparable, eyes drove me crazy
She that type
I wanna have for my lady
Somethin' about you, don't know what it is
I know we just met, but can I give you a kiss?
Grabbed the hand and she hugged me
Actin' kinda shy
Dimples on her face, got you lookin' pretty fly
Baby, this is real talk, I wanna be with you
Little did I know, you were diggin' me too
Now I'm down on my kness, got you sayin' "I do"
So I had to write a song, dedicated to you (To you...)

Repeat Chorus</pre>
