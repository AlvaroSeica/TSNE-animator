"Since the face been revealed, game got real"

[Hook]
We're similar in so many ways
But, I don't even know your name
Maybe that's somethin you've grown to hate
So "please show me your face"

[Verse 1]
Aiyyo wake up, cigarette, make a coffee
Wake me up coffee, wake me up properly
I'm just a zombie tryna play Fonzie
And do my best to pretend that they want me
Maybe, I've been wrongly accused
Caught me in the middle, scribble songs of abuse
Tryna rewrite future wrongs that I'll do
Only takes one list with one big long excuse
I'm onto the truth, make a promise to youse
You don't need me as much as I need you
Mum said "Never bite the hand that feeds you"
And it bleeds true blue on my page
Got hit in the head with a mood swing mate
Sorry I don't get to choose the date
Should've moved away from my tooth decay
I guess the truth is you caught me on a bad day now

[Hook] {X2}

[Verse 2]
Goodnight, sleep tight, have a safe trip
Makeshift message was afraid of this
Met your girl's folks, choke, don't say shit
Give the world hope, know what time it is
So, take this one step at a time
Won't go ape-shit if I mess up my mind
Not embezzling crime, feel the adrenaline rise
Then they're like "please show me your face"
I'll sever the ties to my poor taste
And I hope they saw my face, not a portrait of Norman Bates
Or a stalker of their daughter's grace
Or my morbid state, I've got normal traits now
Whatever the fuck that means
Tryna coordinate my effervescent gleam
In between the food stuck on my front tooth
And I still gotta show 'em my face cause that's the proof
