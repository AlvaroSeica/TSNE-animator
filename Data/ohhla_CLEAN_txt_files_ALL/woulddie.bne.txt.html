[Intro - Big B]
Wish, I would've died for you baby
I would've died for ya, Layzie
I would've died for you, Krayzie
But the Widow try to play me, play me
(7th Sign masterminds. Bizzy The Kid. The Midwest Cowboy)

[Verse One - Bizzy]
Bone ain't feelin my vibe
They sayin "Bizzy, he think he 'Pac" passin out on stage
Rolling Stones with Shock'
Bizzy The Kid grippin his baby, makin us tellin the whole story
Runnin from cops, bustin shots, smackin the top with a forty
I'll never go pop, I'll never go back to Ruthless, stick to the block
You better believe it, and I'm sorry to the fans of Bone
but I'm Bentley, Audi 5's and drop tops
Luke Berry, Swisha Sweets, ain't that's the way that we monster mash
Homies gon respect my game so watch the way we count the cash
Bang, the gang, 7th Sign
27, 7 kids, lookin young, feelin fit and I don't have to be pressed or pimped
I don't need no make up neither, I don't want you to touch my hair
I just wanna reflow with sickness, makin money everywhere
I don't want have to pop a pill, I don't wanna work with real nigga
field nigga, trill nigga, rappin with only ill niggaz
7th Sign crack the steel, nigga, make me wanna kill nigga
Crack the steel, peddle to the meddle, mash the gas and mash the wheel

[Chorus - Big B]
Wish, I would've died for you baby (I represent y'all)
I would've died for ya, Layzie
I would've died for you, Krayzie (I represent y'all)
But the Widow try to play me, play me (The Widow be tryin to get me)

[Verse Two - Bizzy]
I am the General feelin incredible better than
10 year veteran off in the cut with a cup of Essence
Feel the presence, spread the message
Never knew Evanessence, ain't no best friends
Shut up and handle your business
This the new thing, the true thing, 7th Sign's how we doin things
Gangsta party, smokin and drinkin puttin on my dancin shoes
Gotta get that money man; Pay me and I'll come dance for you
Stay the night and bang your broad (Uh) while I'm talkin in tongues
Let me swallow that, it taste like peaches, must've been a mango blunt
Follow that, I am the future
Evolution of elevation, knowledge is the power
We shall overcome the hatred with Double Barrels and Ruegers
Enscripted like an Egyptian, encrypted like biblical Lucifer
7th Sign won't die, 7th Sign boy
You can put that on Joanne I met from San Croy, sucker
Dippin out like Ice Cube, skippin out like Dr. Dre
follow the foot steps of rich, take this bitch and tell 'em "I'm on my way"

[Chorus - Big B]
Wish, I would've died for you baby (I represent y'all)
I would've died for ya, Layzie
I would've died for you, Krayzie (I represent y'all)
But the Widow try to play me, play me (The Widow be tryin to get me)

[Verse Three - Bizzy]
These are my truest feelin's, people are fake as hell (Hell)
Woman don't turn me down (Down)
Feel me, like they feelin Brown (Brown)
I dont' wanna be David Ruffen (Ruffen)
I don't wanna be Ottis Williams (Williams)
I don't wanna be Brue neither smokin chronic, drinkin brew and chillin bitch
You ain't Barry Cody
We were the perfect group, I promise, you broke us up though
Bizzy always tells the truth, ah
Ain't you a liar, ain't you?
You are the venomous snake huh?
Too bad none of the homies got bitten, hell yeah (Shwew) I wrote this for all L.A., uh
Any rapper wants to battle, wanna see who goes the fastest
I don't have to study or nothin I'm a leave that up to you actors
I don't read The Source or The Vibe when I'm up in Barnes &amp; Nobles
Bone Thugs N Harmony, 7th Sign Soldiers
Standin in my gangsta pose, shock' as a cobra
Look in the mind of a madman medicated with Doja, I'm mutilatin his mocha
No metaphor and the rappin is real, let it be the hook, fuck a gimick
If I die, would you kill nigga?

[Chorus - Big B]
Wish, I would've died for you baby (I represent y'all)
I would've died for ya, Layzie
I would've died for you, Krayzie (I represent y'all)
But the Widow try to play me, play me (The Widow be tryin to get me)</pre>
