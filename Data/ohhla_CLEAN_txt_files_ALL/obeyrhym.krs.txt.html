[Intro: Kid Capri]
No rhymin below the belt~!

[MC Shan]
WOOP-WOOP! Sound the alarm
And the B-the B-the Bridge said, "Sprite's the bomb!"
Blowin up the spot like I was nitroglyce'
And who's supposed to knock me out position, KRIS?!!

[KRS-One]
Uh, KRS-One comes with Strike 2
and Shan is through, second strike Shan sees triple Sprite
within his eyesight, and strike three
lyrical verse disperse to obey your THIRST!
