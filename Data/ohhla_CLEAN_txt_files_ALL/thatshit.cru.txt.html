[Yogi]
Aiyyo I wish I had a track on that Nas Illmatic
Spitin verbal slugs like a semi-automatic
I'll bring the alcohol if you wanna bring the static
And if you bring your big mouth then I'm a bring the gat in
[Chadio]
Well yo here I come like a dog in heat
Ejaculate butter shit all over the street
It's the beige skin beige Tim wearer
But I glare and, the best rhymin Rican of my era
[Yogi]
Aiyyo I break a nigga jaw, [w/Mighty Ha] HEE-HAW, feel the country
Loosin kinda way, cause both the bitches want me
Time to get a nut, chill, what's that aroma?
About to smoke more blunts than Avosco with the coma
[Chadio]
Strangers in the night, take flight, you ain't right
Lyrics bite like vampires in the fight
Suck the fuckin life out your miss-led boy
You try to represent I destruct and destroy

[Mighty Ha]
Coming from the top of a shaw the medulla
Burn a chicken head like an addict burn rulers
Hit em in the head home girl do your thing
Lick balls, slap slops, chicken head, spread your wings
[Yogi]
Ill pull a gat and do "Anything" like SWV
Because Yogi is poi-son like BBD
I smoke the chocolate tah with the YMV
I think a nigga pass on that LSD
Meet me at the play-ground with ABC
I break that ass up like EP-MD
I think I'll go "Creep" for some TLC
If she's young I'll hear the BOOP BOOP like Biggie E
[Yogi]
Man if you bring it, better sling it, that's the motto
No time for dollars and a drink, fuck lotto
Goin all out, all over, best believe
Playin shits for keeps and wild tricks up my sleeve
Chad-i-o, rollin wit Cru
Beileve in my music like an Orthodox Jew
Believes in his religion and the skills that I rip
[w/Mighty Ha]
THAT SHIT
THAT SHIT
THAT SHIT

[Mighty Ha]
Zigga zoom, zigga zah, niggas think they all that
Now they ball heads cause I pull their wigs back
Bring the car, yachts, cash and give me staffs
Bring me ass cheek that'll blow your backs out
[Chadio]
Food for the mind, when I rhyme you rewind
Like your Cyndi Lauper, "Time After Time"
Check the pro-gram, no man can escape
Committin verbal crimes like ear drum break
[Yogi]
Aiyyo I don't give a uh, I don't give a uh
I bring it back to that everytime I get stuck
[w/Mighty Ha]
But, BUT, i, I, bring, BRING, flow, FLOW
Don't have to act like it cause yo I know
I know what went down in the park in Bronx River
I know that John Gotti still calling me a nigga
I know the whitest face comes from the black woman
I know my ass is grass cause Armageddon is coming
I know we got big hips it makes us run fast though
I know I'm still a slave calling black women hoe
I know that Columbus ain't discover shit
I know a couple niggas said I sound like Q-Tip
I know you said the sound is Abstract but the 
blood on your face is very real, very very real

[echos and fades away]
I know you said the sound is Abstract but the
Rhythm, the rhythm</pre>
