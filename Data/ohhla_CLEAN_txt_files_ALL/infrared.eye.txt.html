[Eyedea]
Well I guess this is it, I guess its uh.. time or whatever
So I guess I'll start it like this

And I'll never again be as happy as I was when I was in the 7th grade
Before the guilt of having no goals ate my life away
Each day introduced me to somehting that I hadn't experienced yet
Traded A's for F's to gain the time to experiment with drugs and sex
I'll never forget me and jakes first roses trip together
or the times when we all walked aimlessly through summer weather
with nothing better  to do I rode to s.a.and tried to steal a pack of squares
man I miss being a kid with no cares
its the excitement of knowing everything  you touch is new
I just wish I couldv'e stopped to cherish the moment while it lasted but
maybe thats the point, the second your smart enough to recognize freedom
your no longer free
you see heaven isn't some place that we go to when we die
It's that split second in life where you actually feel alive
and until the end of time, we chase the memory of that
hoping the future holds something better than the past
so why do I spend my time runnin' away?
when the truth is right here in the mirror inside my dying face
I can waste my energy tryin to reproduce something thats gone
but my childhood is dead, it's time to move on
so what do you call a person thats already past his peak?
Just keep stack in tha  sheep  you keep counting when you can't go to sleep
Two years out of high school goin on way too deep
tell me again why 7th grade was so brief?
Damn... the curiosity that killed shrodingers cat was the only thing that
kept it alive matter of fact
when life takes your life away how do you get it back?
Like that... like that...
