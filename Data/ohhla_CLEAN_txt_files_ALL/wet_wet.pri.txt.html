[Intro Rap]
Pray I yell fore before I play
Before I foray let me explain, all day all ways
Foreplay? Hmmm...
I can make your cock go higher than the hair on Kid 'n Play
How I'm gonna feel when ya next to me

[Hook]
I'm feelin wet wet wet
In the club thinkin bout you all sweatin me
I'm feelin wet wet wet
You rock the decks like sex on some ecstasy
I'm feelin wet wet wet
Come on baby baby just get wet with me
I'm feelin wet--I'm all wet

[Verse]
On the high horse with a pot of hot sauce
Gotta keep floss yeah of course
Super high gloss gold gold on the cars
You say you wanna toss baby damn I can't talk
Scorch Hibachi and I'm raunchy
Wet like sake damn foxy
Nasty Girl watch me
I'm getting on my knees you keep watchin hockey
And baby let me give it to ya
Baby grab my ass gonna do the nast nast
Get your filofax-hollaback
Baby don't ask write in this task right in the sack
You're fuckin me from Monday until Sunday
Oh! Here's your EZ Pass
Wet in the pool, wet in the shower
Wet in the elevator, Trump Tower or my lunch hour
Stiff like a broomstick Zoom
I think you need to take me in the bathroom quick ooh
Look and you can have it
Eatin out? This pussy got 4 stars in Zagat attack it
I'm a cunning linguist twist words round my tongue
And I ain't gonna rhyme the next one
You do it after I'm done</pre>
