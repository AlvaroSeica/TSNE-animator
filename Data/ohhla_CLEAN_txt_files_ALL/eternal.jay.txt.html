Song:   Eternal Sunshine
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

She said she never fell in love with a Superman
Christian, Muslim, Protestant, Lutheran
I told her that being a mortal is a portal
To the true nature of growth to the Christ like Buddha man
That's why I never spit the traditional garbage of a knife fight
Bright lights, white ice to the fans
The radio is just a stereo, like a house and a home
A chair is just a chair, ask Luther Van
Go to work; go to church let your dreams die
Bow tie, Final Call, and a bean pie
Yarmulke for Hanukkah, wish list for Christmas
This is the gist of the life that we lead, why?
So you can fit in, with the close minded in the sit-ins
And clothes lined in the ed-end
I could care less about a plaque and Benz
And get Punked on TV by my friends
Don't get a nigga wrong, I get tempted by the rewards
That all come along with nigga songs
But what does it mean if I'm a Muslim and you a Jew
And because of that alone we don't get along
And when you talk like this, and try to walk like this
The radio stations'll never put a nigga on
Just Mims, just 50, just Wayne, just Jeezy
Dem Franchize Boyz, and Jimmy Jones
Fuck that, fuck rap this God-hop
King-dom mu-sic for the hard rocks
I'm a spit it till TRL get it and Hot97 hear the nigga with a bomb drop
Ask Flex, ask Slay, ask Who Kidd
Just blaze said Jay is the new kid
I took Eternal Sunshine and I looped it
No drums no hook just new shit</pre>
