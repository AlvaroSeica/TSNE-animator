(Intro, Project Pat; over-lapping oldies song)
Play me some pimpin mayn
Yeah, you know I'm talkin bout
Yeah, you know I'm sayin
A nigga was uhh, geeked up 
Over here on 70th street
On the corner n' shit
She ain't have my money
Real talk, it's all good... yeah

(Hook, Project Pat) [Frayser Boy]

(Verse 1, Juicy J)
Mayn, I'm excited; on my way to the weed mayn
He said he got a girl that a nigga need to meet, mayn
He said she smell good from her head to her feet, mayn
I said what's her nationality, he said "A green thang" (Cough-cough-cough)
She the type of girl that'll have a nigga geeked, mayn
Spend up all ya money like a junky on the creep, mayn
And she got some friends that will keep ya high as me, mayn
Dancin in the sky with the birds and the trees, mayn
I get high like Amy Whitehouse
I'll put pills in anyone's mouth
Smoke up all the weed, fall asleep on the couch
4:20 mothafucka, that's what I'm about

(Verse 2, Project Pat)
We some rich niggas, pass the Gray Poupon
Nah dogg, more like pass the purple blunt
Smells the funk or the pound that's in the car
If the police flag me, I ain't gon' stop
Digital scales for sales, paraphernalia
Either in jail or get bail; that's what they tell ya
I grew up 'round hoodlums, killas, and thieves
Unknown Vice Lords, niggas claimin G.D.
One-eighty Vans, shows we hustlin (Gettin money)
Blowin purp, Cali high, no strugglin
Penetentiary; the chances that I take
It's elementary; I gots to gets the cake
