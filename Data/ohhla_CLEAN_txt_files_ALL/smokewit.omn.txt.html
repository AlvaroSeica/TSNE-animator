Song:   Smoke With Me
Typed by: iamomni dot com

smoke with me, I only burn the good weed, ay oh
smoke with me, I only burn the good weed, say ho

talk with your hands cause the people understand
move the crowd while my man play your favorite summer jam
from the heart of the city, I can see everything
everything is everything, each and everything (x2)

just relax, roll a sack, I aint picking up the phone, holla back
its the chief rocker, amsterdam coffee shopper
the head doctor, green thumb, smoke aqua
the one hitter show stopper, the soul shocker
its so shocking, like the cops at your door knocking
or your smoking bud with your homies and your mom walks in

talk with your hands cause the people understand
move the crowd while my man play your favorite summer jam
from the heart of the city, I can see everything
everything is everything, each and everything (x2)

my affiliate, worthy emcee, searching in sea
from the funk fest to burgundy b
ballyhoo for your avenue when you listen to me
I make noise like a baby, with a pot and a pan (pan)
the last dragon, like leroy, I need more hand man
all the ladies call me papa bag, I see more grams
all up on me, screaming on me give me one more chance
im a b-boy standing in my b-boy stance
thats the fresh shit

talk with your hands cause the people understand
move the crowd while my man play your favorite summer jam
from the heart of the city, I can see everything
everything is everything, each and everything (x2)

smoke with me, I only burn the good weed, ay oh
smoke with me, I only burn the good weed, say ho (x2)</pre>
