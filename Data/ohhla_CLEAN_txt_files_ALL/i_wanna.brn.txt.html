Song:   I Wanna Hear It
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro]
Uhh, yeah, Brand Nubian
Live and direct, knahmean?
("I want to hear it from you")
Word up
("I want to hear it from one, who should know how it is")
Yeah ("I want to hear it from you")

[Lord Jamar]
Uhh, it must be clear the shit is true
Appearin with the Brand Nu', shit you was hearin we would never do
Stop interferin with my crew
You heard it from the source, out the mouth of the horse
We's about to divorce the label that put us on
From the first, unable to disperse our shit properly
I be the maker and the owners of the verse
Be my property, rap Monopoly
Now look at the dichotomy of styles that exist on this hitlist
'Long time 'fore you get this
A strong mind'll make a strong body
A long line at the gate of every party we perform
Niggaz couldn't wait for me to get it on
Impatiently awaiting the third eye of the storm
High from the chalm with the bomb for the Born God Brand Nubian

[Chorus]
("I want to hear it from you")
Uhh ("I want to hear it from one, who should know how it is")
Yeah ("I want to hear it from you")
Uhh ("I want to hear it from one, who should know how it is")
("I want to hear it from you")

[Grand Puba]
That ain't the same old same
Watch me get jiggy, burn with my game
Makin all the mamis just call our name
While diggin on the way we do our thang
Worldwide, we bang
No dibs, peace God, we bring it live like Allen I
Once we get started, bullshit gets departed
Rhymestyle be exotic, psychotic, make a mami get erotic
So let's get it started, Brand Nu' got it
You know the alibi, cause Grand Puba more than fortified
Don't even try, I believe I can fly
Worldwide like the internet, still make your panties wet
Cause this is butter as butter get
So if you feel the testimony, baby you can ride the pony
Not a phony, so come and dig the one and only
Brand Nubian, so what'cha gon' do? (What'cha gon' do?)

[Chorus]
("I want to hear it from you")
Yeah, yeah, yeah ("I want to hear it from one, who should know how it is")
Yeah, this the one ("I want to hear it from you")
No doubt, one ("I want to hear it from one, who should know how it is")
Yeah, uhhhh ("I want to hear it from you")

[Sadat X]
The unbreakable and unmistakable
Like an archive but we'll arrive in y'all hallway
Let's convene, meet by the Tavern on the Green
My seam is from the fly jeans shop from our father
who then made my sister in the 70's she's
an outstand', be the man with my S hat
You don't say yes cat, I'll walk with my scruples and some ruples
The girls stay fly, cats rude as usual
It ain't my fault that whack rappers confusin ya
And every girl in the world can be smashing
You're New York tinted, every time I will bend it
When it comes I be the beast, see me up in that crease
By the exit, we got to keep it hot to death
Y'all can get what's left, hold on my man ain't eat~!
Pour some wine for my man and get a stool for his feet

Yes yes yes
Yeah once again, as we make sagas and create new volumes
And get down like this
I be the, great X, promotin the next
Holdin it down, 'long with the Grand Puba, the Lord Jamar
My man Alamo, the great A, hold us down each and e'ry day
Ron Studd, where ya at? Knahmsayin... {*fades out*}</pre>
