Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Let me fetch the Rocky Road
And your favorite pair of sweats
And the little chocolate kisses that you like
The remote control, baby stay in bed
'Cause when your feelin' low, I just want you to know that I

Still think your beautiful and I
Still think your wonderful though I
Though I'm still just a man and I'll never understand
I'll still try
I'll still try (try)
I'll still try (try)
I'll still try (try)
I'll still try

Let me rub your tummy girl till' you feel better babe
Read you something funny, girl. Jokes to make you laugh
I'll run your bubble bath, when it makes you mean
I'll treat you like a queen 'cause I

Still think your beautiful and I
Still think your wonderful though I
Though I'm still just a man and I'll never understand
I'll still try
I'll still try (try)
I'll still try (try)
I'll still try (try)
I'll still try

Still think your beautiful and I
Still think your wonderful though I
Though I'm still just a man and I'll never understand
I'll still try
I'll still try (try)
I'll still try (try)
I'll still try (try)
I'll still try

Still think your beautiful and I
Still think your wonderful though I
Though I'm still just a man and I'll never understand
I'll still try
I'll still try (try)
I'll still try (try)
I'll still try (try)
I'll still try

Still think your beautiful and I
Still think your wonderful though I
Though I'm still just a man and I'll never understand
I'll still try
I'll still try (try)
I'll still try (try)
I'll still try (try)
I'll still try
I'll still try
I'll still try (try)
I'll still try (try)
I'll still try (try)
I'll still try
I'll still try
I'll still try (try)
I'll still try (try)
I'll still try (try)
I'll still try

I'll still try
I'll still try
I'll still try
I'll still try</pre>
