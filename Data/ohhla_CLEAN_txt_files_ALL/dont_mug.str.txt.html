[Verse 1]
A new day, another morning after
leanin back on my chair in a greasy spoon cafeteria
Last night was some bit leariness done our way
But again we're back in like a day
Chattin shit sittin at the wall table telling jokes
Playin with the salt looking out the window
Girl brings two plates of full English over
With plenty of scrambled eggs and plenty of fried tomata
Get my phone out about give this girl a shout
see if she had a nice time last night uptown
Ask if she fancy's tryin it again some time
then Cal grabs the phone like oy!oy!oy!oy!

[Chorus]
Hold it down boy, your head's getting blurred
I know you can't stop thinking of her
By all means, you can vibe with this girl
But just don't mug yourself, that's all don't mug yourself

(Talking)
Seriously Mike, you fucker
No! No! No!  I mean, I'll fuckin, I'm no way really tryin
I mean I'll fuckin, I can take it or leave it, believe
And then Calvin's like, oy

[Verse 2]
You need to hold it down Jack
Put your phone back
Quit starin into space and eat your snack that's that
She'll want you much more for not hangin on
Stop me if I'm wrong, Stop me if I'm wrong
Why should she be the one who decides
whether it's off or on, or on, or off or on?
Now the girl's rude, I now she's rude
But she screwed right through you, you'll be on your knees soon

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And I'm like, honestly it's not like that
Your actin like I'm prancing like a sap jumpin when she clap's and that
Oy, do you really think I act whack
Cause I'm telling you I'm servin the aces and it's game set and match?
Perfectly in control of this goal, I've got the lead role
won't be foldin, I'm older than you told, girl sold, high speed's gold
Game over, game over, too cold

[Chorus] 2x</pre>
