[Dyverse the First]
Aiyo, make room for the ace boon coon, who stay tuned
That felt, fuck what they doing, cuz they belt hold they pants up
Not mine, my grind's unphantomable, the actual bullet in my spine
I'm a radical but have a good time, out rhymes, out magical lines
To over shadow and shatter you, I'm back from the future
I'm souped up, and super
It's Big Worm Entertainment, and that's what's up, ain't it?
Fall back dog, my heart so rag, it look pain and that
You know Dyverse, I make you famous, just aim and pass
Move vibes like Adam Crate in pow, I'm a novelist
With marvelous novels that's empowering the novices
I go so hard with this, the Children of the Corn
Wanna feast on my harvest til it's gone, and god will let
The foul keep following, and swallow when it's done
Understand my wisdom, and aknowledge it, clown

[Rahsaan]
Introducing the ice man, fuck you, I'm nice, man
Chopping off your fingers, if you grab for the mics, fam
Shorten your life span, raising my right hand
Obey my rap thirst, the flow is a Sprite can
I'm ill like the Philip man, how I can just kill a man
See? I dumped your bitch cuz she's just still a fan
Spit game to a head spin like a ceiling fan
Oobidy, woobidiy, we call that a killa cam
Hah, I spread my swagger like mustard
Try to tell a nigga I'm the wrong one to fuck with
Sucker MC's, you can keep rhyming breezy
It's a job, make something this hard look easy

[Lounge Lo]
The word on the street is hip hop is dead
How it got hit in it's hip, and then shot in the leg
And I'm from New York City, I ain't got no bread
Tell Flex to stop fronting, man, and rock what I said
Gorilla Hill, all day, baldies and dreads
It's a must do, when you dirt, man, you know the ledge
My O-U-T fit nice on, my mic's on
Shut the power, I need no lights on
Hear the beat, snapping his finger, you know I grind and linger
I'm in the hood, got no time for hingers
Beez Mode with a ease flow, curse with Dyverse
Fuck with Ill Phil, then you gon' die first

[Shyheim]
I'm a trap star, running through dirt, like track stars
Cause so many cases, that's how I learned the law
My word is all I got, Shy, I'm like a dictionary
Can't wait til I'm shit with the six, pistol ready
In the Chevy, can better you, my lap pushing
Wishing a nigga would in this hood, try to eat what I'm cooking
When I flame over the stove, put in extra hours
I put your name on the head stone with a boquet of flowers, coward
Give respect, get respect, shit ain't complicated
Disrespect, get hit with "techs", like Boot Camp made it
Smif N Wess, a special, I invest you into death
What you mean, what I mean, why you got paid like rent

[Dr. Ama]
Rap's like ABCs, and H2V, L-R-G and H-C-G's
S.I.C., your ace we squeeze
It's papes, we need, erase these keys
Too much in the p's? We seeing scrape knees
That's gangsta, best believe, certified G's
On top of the game, no shame in it
Soft top in the range, you dame in it
Just Satan for the souls he stole, now I want hell
You run tell, yelling my name, cuz my guns yell
The sun frail, beat ya honey buns pale, moisterize the face
With that gun jail, unvail The Outfit

[The Last American B-Boy]
I'm jump inside this beat like it's J.Lo's ass
Cutting class, fuck the teacher bitch, and give me a pass
Never left, The Last American, beat ya then dash
Grab a shorty, pack a forty, nigga, give me the brass
I be going for the cash, so don't even ask
Super flow, rhymes a go, yes, the best atlast
Don't make me laugh, your rhymes a joke
When I'm rich, I'mma rhyme like I'm broke
Take a low Ferry boat, like soldier, niggas is dead
With a flow, that got Noah get tools out the shed
If ya heard what he said, then ya saying he's nice
Scared of God, like pork fried rice, now get it right, nigga

[Phil Anastasia]
Mr. Phil Anastasia, who wanna fight?
With me against the industry, in the heat of the night
Recite with one voice, enough noise, Staten's back forever
Never to be forsaken, or to be taken light
Pass the mic, I lift the barriers to carry the torch
Resource with vocab, the kid's savvy when he talks
N.Y. native, with more innovative thoughts
Then a God damn renaissance man, of source
Walk the walk, every dog has his pain in courts
Incarcerated scarfaces, watch the cases get tossed
Forks in the road, no telling, how many I crossed
Write my own destiny, and move with heavier corps
Never take the easy route, I'm never taking a loss
My face, they either make it big, or take it by force
Who's the boss? Tony Maseli's coming up short
And of course, I rep The Outfit from out of New York

[King Just]
Yo, lights, camera, action, you're on
Clear out the way for Mr. Choke Armstrong
King Kong been locked up like Akon
Kiss the ring, sit on the throne, he the last don
My Outfit sick, from my crown to my kicks
Got a doorag flow that's as bad as my bitch
Got a slim goodie hoodie, with slacks, I still boogie
My father named Album, my friend Al Doogie
I'm icing, my white tee, and you ain't gotta like me
They like Just do it, and I ain't talking Nike
I'm an addict with a fabric, you faggot
It's The Outfit, your raps speak, come wit it, then not have it</pre>
