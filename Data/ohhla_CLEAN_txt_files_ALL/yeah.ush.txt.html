[Usher] Peace up, A-Town down
[Lil J] Yeah! (yeahhh!!) okay! (okayyy!!)
[Usher] Usher (Usher Usher Usher..)
[Lil J] and Lil Jon!!
[Usher] Yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) - yeah
        Yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) - yeah

[Verse - Usher] (w/ Lil Jon in background)
I was up in the club wit my homies, trying to get a lil V-I
Keep it down on the low key (low key)
You should know how it feels (hey!! hey!!)
I seen shorty she was checking up on me
From the game she was spitting in my ear
You would think that she knew me (knew me)
I decided to chill (okay!!) Conversation got heavy! (hey!)
She had me feeling like she's ready to blow! (watch out!!)
Oh! (watch out!!) She's saying "come get me!" (come get me)
So I got up and followed her to the floor
She said "baby let's go"
When I told her (let's go!!) I said

[Chorus - Usher &amp; (Lil Jon)]
(Yeah!!) Yeah - yeah
Shorty got down low, said "come and get me"
(Yeah!!) Yeah - yeah
I got so caught up, I forgot she told me
(Yeah!!) Yeah - yeah
Her and my girl, they used to be the best of homies
(Yeah!!) Yeah - yeah
Next thing I knew, she was all up one me screaming

[Bridge - Usher &amp; (Lil Jon)]
(Yeah!!) yeah yeah (yeah!) yeah yeah - yeah!
(Yeah!!) yeah yeah (yeah!) yeah yeah - yeah!

[Verse - Usher] (w/ Lil Jon in background)
She's all up in my head now
Got me thinking that it might
Be a good idea to take her with me
Cause she's ready to leave (ready to leeeeaaavvee) (let's go!!)
And I got to keep it real now
Cause on a 1 to 10, she's a certified 20
But that's just ain't me (hey!!)
Cause I don't - know, if I take that chance
Just where's it gonna lead?
But what I do - know, is the way she dance
Make shorty alright wit me
The way's she Get Low!!!
I'm like yeah, just work that out for me
She asks for one more dance, and I'm like yeah
How the hell am I supposed to leave? (let's go!!)
And I say.

[Chorus]

[Bridge - Usher &amp; (Lil Jon)]
(Yeah!!) yeah yeah (yeah!) yeah yeah - yeah!
(Yeah!!) yeah yeah (yeah!) (Hey hey heyyyy!!!! Luda!!!)
Yeah yeah - yeah!

[Verse - Ludacris]
Watch out, my outfit's re-di-culous
In the club looking so conspicuous
And RAWR!! These women all on the prowl
If you hold the head steady, I'm a milk the cow
And forget about game, I'm a spit the truth!
I won't stop till I get em in their birthday suits!!
So gimme the rhythm and it'll be off wit their clothes
Then "bend over to the front! and touch your toes!!"
I - left the Jag I took the Rolls
If they ain't cutting then I put em on foot patrollll (oww!!)
How ya like me now?
When my pinky's valued over three hundred thou-sand!
Let's drink, you the one to please
Ludacris fill cups like double D's
Me and Ursh' once more, and we leaves em dead
We want a lady in the street, but a freak in the bed that say

[Chorus]

[Bridge - Usher &amp; (Lil Jon)]
(Yeah!!) yeah yeah (yeah!) yeah yeah - yeah!
(Yeah!!) yeah yeah (yeah!) yeah yeah - yeah!

Take that, rewind it back
Lil Jon got the beat that make your booty go (clap)</pre>
