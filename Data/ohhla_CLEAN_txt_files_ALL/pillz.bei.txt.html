Typed by: AZ Lyrics

When they play this in the club
Everybody know what's up
Kind of feel like you high right now, huh
Kind of feel like your mind's in the sky, huh
You ever felt like it's all moving slow mo
Ever felt you could fly but you don't though
You ever felt like it's almost over
Ever felt like you can't get no closer
Than where we are right now
Can you feel it can you feel it
Walk up in the spot light what up don't see no [?]
Had a couple girlfriends but that ain't enough
[?] nice got a feel like rocky the night feel good right
Drop a couple M's in the club real party people know what is up
When you see us in the club you know what is up
I ain't never got no pillz but this is how I feel
When you see us in the club you know what is up
I ain't never got no pillz but this is how I feel
Have you ever got enough while you sip slow
Have you ever got lost in the tempo
Has it ever felt low with the [?]
I feel right now don't trip though
Have you ever made love on the dancefloor
Ever wanna fall in love but you can't though
Ever stepped on the brakes at a green light
Ever said it was wrong when it seemed right
Feel good right drop a couple pimps in the club
Everybody know what is up
When you see us in the club you know what is up
I ain't never got no pillz but this is how I feel
When you see us in the club you know what is up
I ain't never got no pillz but this is how I feel
When you see us in the club you know what is up
I ain't never got no pillz but this is how I feel
When you see us in the club you know what is up
I ain't never got no pillz but this is how I feel</pre>
