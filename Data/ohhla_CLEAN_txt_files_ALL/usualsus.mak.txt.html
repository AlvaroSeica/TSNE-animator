[Makeba Mooncycle]
Who is this I see, staring back at me
Trying to get all deep in my reality
See they painting pictures, and trynna figure
To see how the Moon maintains her glitter
Check my luster, and my shine
Damn her feet still hitting the grind
I must maintain, to hurt and stain
From Brooklyn Bridges, Carolina riches
Same hustle, same struggle, nobody to love ya
Looking for the real in this world of fakes
No regrets here, only mad mistakes
Thinking you controlled every move I make
Don't eat from mine, just get your own plate
Why befriend MC's, they drain you energy
Get right up on ya, snatch your persona
Pro black ass with white girl dream
Down for the struggle with big bitch schemes
They broke the code, and sold my mold
Thought ignorant brothers could hold me back
And steal my light, knock me right off track
Like I couldn't see they were coming for me
It's crystal clear, I'm all in your ear

[Chorus 2X: sample]
And oh, he comes, there's no survivors
You got that real look in your eyes

[Makeba Mooncycle]
See I caught you staring out the corners of your eyes
But don't look suprised, star struck, the mesmerized
The heavens laid hands on me, they selected
Blessed me, slaid my enemies, I protected
What you give out, comes back, ten folds
The skills I possess, outweighs your weight and gold
Some say I broke the mold, I say I'm too cold
I'm tired of dealing with brothers with bad moods
And I'm tired of dealing with sisters with attitudes
Those evil eyes committed a crime
Falsified vows and falsified rhyme
Surrounded by enemies, an up hill battle
On the way to the top, I'm sleeping to Seattle
Waiting for the ultimate reward
Waited for someone to move on the same accord
Made promises to look out, whomever got on first
Used my resources, to fill and then you cursed
Left me pine barrain, your reasons not apparent
Couldn't even put me on your album for a verse
Knowing how I nurse, now you on the third
Still not a word, I can watch you die real slowly over time
I will always be nice and remain in my prime
I refuse frustration, don't call confrontation

[Chorus to end w/ Makeba Mooncycle on the phone]</pre>
