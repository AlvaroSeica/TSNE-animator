[9th Wonder a/k/a 9thmatic]
Yeah... Live and direct, it's ya boy 9thmatic
King of NC, True School, 9th said it
Jay-Z, Mary Blige, Erykah the credit
Read between the lines, I said it I meant it
And as long as I'm gettin paper then it's all copasetic
Yeah, it's Cadillac if it's money on deck
Checks I'm into ballin, the beat tape brawler
I stop tracks, make the beats, fall back, I'm on it
Early in the morning, getcha game up
cause it's early in the quarter and I'm just gettin started
Trap like the Carter, New Jack's gettin respect
from true cats, I just call it payin dues back
So what I'm in it fo'? I come highly recommended
Folk raps spendin guap, what it's hittin' foe?
9th Wonder once again, 9 signin off
True School, Jamla, Academy and I'm the boss

[Chorus: Erykah Badu]
And I get real silly, and I get real silly, hmm
And I get real silly, and I get real silly
And I get real silly, and I get real silly, hmm
And I get real silly, ohhhh, ooh-ooh

[David Banner]
Who gave Clifford Harris +Rubberbands+, heat from Wayne Carter and
Maurice Young +Thug Holiday+, look I'm just sayin
Why you put yo' name before yo' beat and don't thank me
I did "Tip Drill", swipe a card thru ya asscheeks
..Ask me, if you don't get a beat
from L.C. or P.D., then your MP3's WEAK!
Lavell Crump or Patrick Douthit
David Banner, 9th Wonder, Big Face is the clique, trick!
YAE!!

[Chorus]</pre>
