[Trey Songz]
She's gone again
She's gone again (aw no)
Every time she leaves it's my heart that she's taken from me
I dunno if she's gone for good or returning in the morning
Cannot wait through the night cause I can't help the tossing and turning
I want you to know that our bed, our sheets, our pillows get lonely
on...Yo side of the bed

[Chorus]
Yo side, yo side, yo side, yo side, yo side
Yo... on yo side of the bed {*3X*}
Yo side, yo side, yo side, yo side (it's so lonely there)
I don't wanna sleep if you ain't here... noooo

[Trey Songz]
I just wanna breathe your air
Watch you when your wrapping up your hair
Gazing at the mirrors up there, I'm reaching while imagining that you're here
Awake through the night cause I can't help the tossing and turning
I want you to know that our bed, our sheets, our pillows get lonely
on... yo side of the bed
Yo side, yo side, yo side, yo side, yo side
Yo... on yo side of the bed
Yo side, yo side (where I lay my head) yo side, yo side, yo side
Yo... on yo side of the bed

[Chorus]

[Trey Songz]
Play on...
That's what you gotta do sometimes
Let it play baby...
So lonely there...
on... yo side of the bed
yo side, yo side, yo side, yo side, yo side
Yo... on yo side of the bed
yo side, yo side, (your pillow is waiting girl, pillow is waiting girl)
yo side, yo side, yo side

[Chorus]

[Trey Songz]
Sleep she's coming back... sleep</pre>
