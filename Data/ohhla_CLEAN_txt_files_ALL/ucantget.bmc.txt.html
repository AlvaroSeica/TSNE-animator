Typed by: AZ Lyrics

You can't get enough of it [x5]

[Chorus]
You can't get enough of my love and my loving
you can't get enough of my kiss and my kissing
you can't get enough of my touch and my touching
you can't get enough of it [x3]

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
You can't get of me I'm the one that you love
spend time through the week and give you back rubs
you say you want a thug that can come and beat it up
so drop that lame he ain't nothin but a scrub
I'm a put it on you I ain't playin no games
once I hit you'll never be the same
kiss on ya neck have yo body weak and drained
and I'm a do my thang girl straight beat it out the frame
I'm a take control make ya ass fold
goin slow mo while deep in the hole
let's switch positions you on top
ride up and down til you feel you wanna stop
got you climaxin all on my sheets
now that's over gone drop to ya knees I know you a freak
you ain't gotta tell me [x3]

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Girl you can't forget how nigga put it down
so when I come around I'm gone put it down
hit you from the back shawty gone turn around
I'm a fuck you like a dog have you make a freaky sounds
turn yo ass over put my tongue in the cat
naw I don't even get down like that
guarantee I beat it up til you climax
so fast like that have you scratching on my back
you can't get enough cause my sex so rough
so tough and you steady tellin me you want a thug
a real ass nigga who can come and beat it up
freak it up like a g til we both get nut
and I know you wnt more lil mama stop frontin cause aye [x3]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You can't get enough of me I'm the one that you love
Girl you can't forget how a nigga put it down [x3]
