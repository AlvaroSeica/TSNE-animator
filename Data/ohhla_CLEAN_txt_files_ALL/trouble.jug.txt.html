[Buddy Slim]
I declare war 
The joy becomes a rappifyin weapon 
If you step in 
When your draws get mobbed behind enemy lines
You become a sittin duck but fuck 
I ain't givin em livin trifle 
The pen and pad becomes a 12 gauge rifle 
This is no laughing matter 
Step into this you step in a minefield 
Your body's scattered 
You people drop pickin up the pieces 
But only corny niggas 
The attack from a brotha like the Buddy never ceases 
Without a moment of silence the violence thickens
So if you ain't got it together you slim pickings 
Shorts and prisoners are never taken 
If you fakin all the booty competition 
I'm a bag fuck a white flag 
Get down and dirty like a brotha in the trench 
Leave a nigga dead and stinkin as he wonders what his stench is 
I'm bustin clip after clip 
My artillery will funk on the punk 
When ya wanna test my shit

[Interlude: *horns and scratches*]

[Breezly Brewin]
Tell it to hell is it
I feel my brain swell like meningitis 
With the slightest mind motion 
Givin me the notion
That I got it bad 
I think I got a brain tumor 
Brain rumor 
Such a pain to analyze the strain and then understand it
The seed was planted
That shit is ill but still 
The thought I'm lovin got the dome growin 
With the biscuit in the oven 
Shovin nothin but the nutrients 
My diet to support me
A whiff of the spliff 
A guzzle of the forty to inspire fire thought
To the mic there was marriage
Causin competition 
Verbal miscarriage of the mental fetus 
Greet us with the rugged rhythm then I'm showin
I think I feel my water breakin thus I'm flowin
Timin my contractions 
Concentratin on my breathin
Heavin curses at the father he has the funk 
Cuz if I flunk my shit ain't livin
Pushin givin every bit of what I'm worth 
And as the Brewin drops the lyrical 
The miracle of birth

[Interlude: *horns and scratches*]

[Buddy Slim]
I be the sick ass brotha, nasty ass nigga 
A phony motherfucker grave digga 
I know this sounds rough 
But I had enough to funk 
So part of me the heart of me
So if you corny nigga 
It's like cloggin up my artery 
You cuttin circulation 
So now it's do or die 
While niggas always try to test my shit
Only preservation of the funk is why I kick this
As I give a simple diagnosis of the sickness

[Breezly Brewin]
Now upon the fruits of my labor 
Your ear feasts 
The beast from within 
It's some shit ain't it
The picture painted 
From the use of a noun and a verb might disturb 
We make you say, "Damn that nigga's crazy" 
Well if we crazed, deranged well then we fittin
If you say the world's a normal place
Who the fuck you kiddin?
Your mind's blind if you say you haven't seen this
As I walk the fine line between insanity and genius
