Yo, cut it up one time, man

This one's goin out.. to the.. pretty people
Yo, check it out

[ VERSE 1 ]
My Main Source throws a Wild Pitch to Organize nuff Konfusion
For your Hollywood Basics, folly ( ? )
Trolleys contagent to the various parts of town
But you'll never reach the section of the brain that stores the sound
That is heard consequently, calms all sequentally
Mentally pokin in the fluids that be quenchin me
Thirst for rehearsal, adverb reversal, adverse reverberation
Plus placement on Earlobe Avenue
Haven't you heard, nerd?
The one man band plans scams with preferred words
I uplift and blend, persist to send shockwaves
Octane flocks brains towards the Planet Rock days
Obtain various platters with vital data
A spinal splatter easily ceasing the idle chatter
I'm feasibly seekin to find a plateau
Passin the last flow lyrically logical to astro-
physicists, you ask your little click why
Your light came late like the 5th of July
My fireworks ( ? ) circumvent your circumstance
Germs and toys'll thrust, I'm poisonous like certain plants
Now all it really is is wordplay, so this be recess
Instead of Jungle Jim's my tongue'll tempt them to be fresh
I reflect to recline and define your defect
The One Man Arsenal, epitome of respect

[ CHORUS ]
(To make a short story long, just listen up close)
(I'm not a regular competitor, first rhyme editor)
(MC in the place gonna give you a dose)
(Melody arranger, poet, etcetera)
(With the dynamite blow just for your head)
(Rock from party to party, backyard to yard)
(And I hope you can relate to what I just said)
(I tear it up y'all and bless the mic with the gods)

[ VERSE 2 ]
Never say a rhyme that's less than hoopin
Intelligent, all the girls I'm scoopin
This is just a small rap representation
Down with the universe since the foundation
Clowns went to Jupiter to peep my sound station
A beautiful array of cut 'n scratch configurations
Limitations strictly defined by motivation
Know your place in the maze when there's chaos and mayhem
It's easy to ace them with a back-in-the-day gem
Beats in the basement is a worthwhile day spent
Channeling my energy so children will remember me
Still instillin remedies to thrill and kill the nemesis
Speech pattern blemishes, refreshin as a reservoir
Veterans wore gold chains to boost repertoires
The only link I need is in a word connection
Serve a fresh one, rhymin in the shower be the best one

[ CHORUS ]

Now rock this beat
Haha, yeah
This one is a special dedication to all of you out there
that can scratch, that can produce
and that can rock the m-i-c
You know
Cause that's me doin the cats in the background
the beat I put togtether, you know
Big up to the TDS Mob
and then then, you know, the rhymes I'm doin
I got it all, the complete package
You can't fuck with that at all
All you people out there that can just rhyme, you wanna battle?
We need to take it to the triathlon
You need to shut up and bring all that shit to the table
I'll take you out one by one, yo
And I'm out</pre>
