Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!! Ahhh!!!! Yo!

[Verse One: Vybz Kartel]
Good pussy gyal, yuh drive mi insane
Buckle up mi a crash inna yuh lane
Tek it off, imagine a plane
Back it up, pon di runaway train
MI GOT DI MARIJUANA INNA MI BRAIN
LEVEL BLOOD INNA MI VEIN HAVE A LIKKLE CHAMPAGNE
BLEACH OUT WHITER THAN COCAINE
AND MI FULL UP A TATTOO SIMILIAR TO LIL' WAYNE
Pretty gyal come fi di sugarcane, cocky smart whenever yuh gimmi brain
Money rain, money hurricane

[Verse Two: Busta Rhymes]
It's Busta Bus I'm comin like the apocalypse
I'm puttin this dick in the back of your bitch's esophagus
I'm fuckin bitches with asses bigger than a rhinoceros

OK SEE YOU ALREADY KNOW WHAT THE CALL IS
(FLATLINE EVERYTING!!!) YOU ALREADY KNOW WHO THE BOSS IS
(GASLINE EVERYTING!!!) YOU ALREADY KNOW WHAT THE SCORCH IS
THE WAY I'M BRINGIN DOWN YOUR BITCH WHEN I COME AND SLIDE IN MY OFFICE
(Get low Bus!) Don't touch any of my bitches you bastard
You know they had to get the God to come and visit the classic
Little mami suck me off until she needed some chapstick
'Cause dude is angry fuck it he already gettin his ass kicked! (TURN IT UP!!!)
TO TELL THE TRUTH I THINK YOU BETTER RESPECT IT
WHEN I'M LEAVIN ALL THE BITCHES FOLLOW ME OUT THE EXIT

WE CONTINUE THE SAGA CONGLOMERATE (GAZA!!!)

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Hey! 'Gon put it on me (Put it on me) 'Gon show me how you work
Shawty shawty you can make that booty twerk, already know

'Gon move that thang left to right, you fuckin with the best tonight
Better hold on tight, already know
Already know UH HAH! Already know already know UH HAH!
Already know

[Verse Three: T-Pain]
