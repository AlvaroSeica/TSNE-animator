[Intro]
 
[Yeah]
Come on down
 
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls
We going' make noise in this world
We don't stop, we don't quit
Break 'em down, rock 'ya shit
 
[Verse 1]
Yeah
Green for brave rap, yeah full metal jacket Hood ghetto madness BANGBANG
APB the most wanted my ghost haunted Top of your block copping' a squat Run post on it
House of Amityville styles, humanity still wilds, when i spit and a few families die
Long kiss, sweet dreams Heat steams outta Hell's Kitchen your bell ringing', greet me
Lord have Fall cash, bad weather bag cheddar Body-bag mice, big dogs don't let up
We out to eat, got bloody mouth disease, out your team, slouched and bounced in V's
I crown the beach, punish a thousand streets Million man march stand-offs, announce my fleet
Apocalypse Now, I knock your click down, I gots'ta live now NOW!
 
[Chorus]
You wanna rock out, tear your block down, make it hot now-Come on down
You wanna rage out, front-page style till your caged down-Come on down
You wanna raise hell until we angels in the same hell-Come on down
I never surrender never give up never give a fuck
 
[Verse 2]
Lyrically cock me back, I'm heavy-gauge calibre Got more bars than Attica ATTICA
Got more scars than middle pastors from Africa Holla dog and I rock your boat like Amistad
Hang men like Klansmen got a job Slang gems packed in all my monologues
Nigga, I spit your god's pain Get Sleepy Hollow Run 'em down Ichabod Crane
International, still Dance with Wolves, get it? I'm credible, incredible boy check it!
We King-Kong beat your chest, we live long Compose darts like Mozart, you sing songs
Hate me Break these Average street little squads Tasty Serve 'em like Adebisi in Oz
Knock 'em out, clock 'em out, put 'em in the ground Black out, box out now NOW!
 
[Chorus]
You'd rather die strong than live weak Dog speak!-Come on down
When you stand up they cramp up Throw your hands up-Come on down
You never caved in but slaved them, AMEN!-Come on down
I never surrender, never give up Never give a fuck
 
[Verse 3]
I creep up like quiet storm, riot wars, close shop up Timothy McVeigh the sick way, blow spots up
Man down, fragile, call doctors EMS we the best, fold your rosters
Its backbreaker, spinal-tap, lace up your boots Street eloquent Street medicine, paid dues
Heavy-metal every ghetto touched up, Maybelline style Beautiful, loosing' my schools, laying' seeds down
I'm all-American like apple pies, battered wives, shattered lives, jagged knives Yeah,YEAH!
And give battle cries with savage guys in paradise, recognise we here Here, HERE!
 
[Chorus]
You wanna rock out, tear your block down, make it hot now?-Come on down
Wanna rage out, front-page style till your caged down?-Come on down
Wanna raise hell until we angels in the same hell?-Come on down
You see I never surrender, never give up Never give a fuck
You'd rather die strong than live weak? Dog speak!-Come on down
When you stand up they cramp up Throw your hands up-Come on down
You never caved in but slaved them, AMEN!-Come on down
I never surrender, never give up Never give a fuck

Sword &amp; Shield It's all to the real
It's all for the thrill It's all for the kill
Sword &amp; Shield It's all to the real
It's all for the thrill It's all for the kill
Sword &amp; Shield It's all to the real
It's all for the thrill It's all for the kill
Sword &amp; Shield It's all to the real
It's all for the thrill It's all for the kill
COME ON DOWN!!</pre>
