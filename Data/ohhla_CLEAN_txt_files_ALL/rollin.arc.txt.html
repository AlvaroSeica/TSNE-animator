[Verse 1]
Rollin hard like sum dubs
Smokin green wit the windows up
Call ya gurl I'ma pick her up
Say no mercy, finna fuck
Hurry up, jump inside lookin at the diamonds shinin
Hi as hell down 85, wit her head between my thighs
2G drop top, fast enuff ta make cops stop
Lickin every drip drop, 16 color flip flop
Charts we gonna tip top, scatta when the clips pop
Everybodys lips lock, eva since my shit dropped
They say Archie be crazy, they say Archie da??
They say Archie don't play no games and he don't take no shit
They say we ride on dubs, and yes our diamonds shinin
An if you luv it like I do, then stop and rewind it

Hook : Archie
I'm rollin hard like dem dubs on a Bentley man (On a Bentley man)
My diamonds shinin cuz we got plenty man (We got plenty man)
You askin me where I'm from, I from the Durty Durty (From the Duuurrttay)
Where dem gurls showin luv for they cutty buddy (Cutty Buddy)

I'm rollin hard like dem dubs on a Bentley man (On a Bentley man)
My diamonds shinin cuz we got plenty man (We got plenty man)
You askin me where I'm from, I from the Durty Durty (From the Duuurrttay)
Where dem gurls showin luv for they cutty buddy (Cutty Buddy)

[Verse 2]
You muggin hard, we gon mug ya back
We ride on dubs and lacs, and bring dem thugs wit gats
You betta ask yoself the question where the fuck you at
You done pulled ya pistol, seen mine, then ya snuck it back
Now it's time fo us ta shine, gettin pais ta bust a rhyme
You don't like dat SS, only reason cuz it's mine
I got 4 DVD's, 2 TV's and VCR's
Play Station on my motocycle, gurl think whats in my car
Navigator wit the mirror tent
I started up wit a god damn finger print
So many cell phones, we might as well own Sprint
Grindin 7 years and ya still can't pay ya own rent
Bitch get ya own shit

Hook 

[Verse 3]
I'ma keep laughin while my paper's stackin
An while yall peoples like wha happened
Archie made it rappin
Goin platinum boy made it twice, my lyrics is nuthin nice
If you don't give me a peice of the pie, I'ma take my slice
Cold as ice and dats a fact boy
Archie wit Phat Boy, drinkin on the yac
Drunk not knowin how ta act boy
Bentleys on 20's, and hoes dat wanna give me plenty
Brains in the Range, I'm swervin and switchin lanes
It's a damn shame dat you don't know how dome feels
While my rist stay on chill, you done ???
An you might not cheat, but I bet ya gurl will
Hypnotize tha trick quick when ya spinnin the crome wheels
Rollin Hard Nigga
