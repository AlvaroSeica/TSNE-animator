[Chorus]

I'm a fat boy, I'm a I'm a fat boy

Pocket fulla paper, sneakers on my feet (woah)
Pocket pocket fulla paper, sneakers on my feet (woah)
I'm a fat boy (yup), I'm a fat boy (yup)

Poc-pocket fulla paper, sneakers on my feet (woah)

[Verse 1: Big Mibbs]
Now let's go heavy on the beat
I lean with my Chevy on the creep
Squeak through ya neighberhood very discreet
Peace as I turn into Andretti on the streets
I'm well tuned and the sound is fresh air
Now just assume it's goin' down like pressed hair
Now what can ya tell me
I kick it like Pelle
With pretty young things that got rings in they bellay
Welcome to L.A., home of the Ese
Chrome on the Chevay
Take a few tokes and then choke off the PepÃ© Le Pew
And yes they da crew that finna rule for a decade or two
There's nothin' you can do besides stand there and watch
With hands in your pockets, sayin' Nigga they can rock it
I'm I'm a fat boy, I'm I'm a fat boy
Yea you heard the track boy
Now let's bring it back boy like

[Chorus]
Pocket fulla paper, sneakers on my feet (woah)
Pocket pocket fulla paper, sneakers on my feet (woah)
I'm a fat boy (yup), I'm a fat boy (yup)
I'm a fat boy (yup), I'm I'm a fat boy (yup)
Pocket fulla paper, sneakers on my feet (woah)
Poc-pocket fulla paper, sneakers on my feet (woah)
I'm a fat boy (yup), I'm a fat boy (yup)
I'm a fat boy (yup), I I'm a fat boy (yup)

[Verse 2: Be Young]
Ay yo, PAC DIV's chillin', Chillin' is good
Just got paid, do my thang as I should
In my new car speakers bang, let 'em push
Girlie say Be Young that hook is no good
Speakers understood, there ain't none fresher
So cool in school I skipped both semesters
Girls blew me kisses and sent over letters
Sayin' dey luh my style, when they wanna know better
Well uh, I tell 'em I do dis in my leisure
Sean John, Gaultier, D&amp;G sneakers
Yea sean short nay it's colder as ya freezer
Broke as a joke but I still toke Visas

And I'm a fat boy so you know how it go

Pocket pocket fulla paper, sneakers on my feet (woah)

Pocket fulla paper, sneakers on my feet (woah)
Poc-pocket fulla paper, sneakers on my feet (woah)
I'm a fat boy (yup), I'm a fat boy (yup)
I'm a fat boy (yup), I I'm a fat boy (yup)

[Verse 3: Likewise (Like)]
Yeah, you heard the hook right?
The new school fat boys, what it look like?
We spit rounds to ya beats for a good price
We crisp down to the sneaks, make you look twice
Look twice, won't get a third time
See I'm from planet Mars, I'm not from Earth, I'm
Something different, I crash landed
This whack shit I'm seein', I can't stand it
You dudes rap like, they got a Mac, right?
Lip gloss be poppin', better act right
I spit awesome, sick cough and crack light
The flow's dope, though I never lived a trap life
Yeah, the fat boy I got my swag right
We never left, but it feels like we back, right?

Pocket fulla paper, sneakers on my feet (woah)
Poc-pocket fulla paper, sneakers on my feet (woah)
