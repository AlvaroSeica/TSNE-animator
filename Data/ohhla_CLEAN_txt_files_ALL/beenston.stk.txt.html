Typed by: AZ Lyrics

been stoned kids
ten million strong and blowing were been stoned kids
ten million strong
fuck
purple syrup on my white tee
I'm feeling nicely
smoking on that light green
I'm pilled out
eating v's and [?]
I f I fall asleep I may never wake up
stak wake up the weed mans here
well ima roll a blunt why dont you go get some beer
gonna get inebriated guess its just became a habit
do this on a daily basis safe to say we have to have it
blunt boxes roaches pill bottles all through the crib 
ou can see that I'm no role model bottles in the trash can we dont be recycling
I ts had to remember when your drunk and eating vicodin
uhh but anyway thats another 16
god damnit warren b what did I do with that green
he say we smoked it all
I say we smoked it all
well lemme give my folks a call chillen wheres the alcohol cauz

[Chorus]
I  hate coming down touching the fucking ground guess I'm a junkie
because I stay with some kind of buzz [x2]

one day I'm in houston and I'm trying to get blue
my homie turned me on to some dj screw and that tussin ex down there they drink it like cris
after a few sips I start feeling like this
body feeling numb everythings gettin slow sounds like this musics playing in its original tempo
tingling sensation talk about a killer feeling boy
that syrups like a psychedlic penacillin
sips turn to swallows and now I'm really gone
you can see the lights a shining but it aint no body home
I  dozed off with a blunt in my hand woke up the next morning smoking man cauz

[Chorus]
I  hate coming down touching the fucking ground guess I'm a junkie
because I stay with some kind of buzz [x2]

demerol, morphine, nepadrine, codeine, gone on them hydrocodone
I'm outa my body outa my mind outa my
zone
the porch lights on but I said nobody home pupils swollen heart
rolling now I'm sinking in my whole shits tingling ooooo
[?] feel like ahhh body feels like blah oh my god
I  feel like I'm 62 pounds and an ounce feet swinging from a cloud
lookin down at the ground wow xanex valums coladapins floating and I may never come down again nope
higher than a hippy in a helicopter
stak wont wake up somebody call a doctor
man you better not touch that phone
I  feel good than a mother fucker leave me alone cauz

[Chorus]
I  hate coming down touching the fucking ground guess I'm a junkie
because I stay with some kind of buzz [x2]

I ve got issues but then again who doesnt doesnt I woulda lost it long ago
I f I wasnt buzzing buzzin [x2]</pre>
