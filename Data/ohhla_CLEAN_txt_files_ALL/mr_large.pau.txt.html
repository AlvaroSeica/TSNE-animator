OK boss

[Mr. Large/Chubb Rock](Diehard/Biz Markie)
From East to West, whether your thin or thick
Whether your girl sucks lollis or just pure dick
Mario Puzo said that I'm the don
W-W I'm the shit dot com
The first born, gone, born conceaded
The black Moses, ask me to leave Egypt
Straight heady, I manage heavy, and lolli petty
I gave R. Kelly a Rolex wit a diamond bezzy
Rock Steady, beg me, consider me stern
The original hoodlum, Fishburn had to learn
Supersperm, court's adjorn for the ?nollin?
(You, you got what I need)
Let her toss your sald, big hittas love to sit wit big figgas
I love black people, but I can't stand niggas
The ozz heads, back me, I'll cock shoggy
Ready to hold it down, I pop niggas like acne
Pay a token to breathe
Apollo wit low creed
For every government nigga, there's government cheese
I'm Mr. Please, Mr. Large
Thirty foot garage
Mercedes beggy
Mad cheddy
Mr. Elly</pre>
