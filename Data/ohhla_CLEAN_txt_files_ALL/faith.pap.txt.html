[Verse One]
I'm feelin grouchy, saucy, hungry, raunchy
Need new sex, lookin for brunettes or blondies
Won't make 'em baby mommies I just want 'em to slob me
Sometimes that be the only thing that calms me
Police be actin like +Starsky And Hutch+
These fucks, schemin so they can charge me
Cops need collars, so they could feel bossy
Yo tried to get your collars up, you think you Fonzy?
I eat alot of fish and parsley
Green vegetables, sweet peas and broccoli
Drink alot of water so it could wash me
My homie told me stop eatin rappers, he tryin to starve me
I ain't startin trouble me but pardon me 
Rappers get a little hot and start actin cocky
Maury Povich need to swab me
These dudes use to be my +Suns+ like Charles Barkley
You think you Scarface? I bag the shotty
And get rid of Tony like 'Melo and AmarÂ’e
Man that's word to Gaddafi
Your war stories put me to sleep, I need some coffee
Braggin 'bout old work, that's beyond me
You ain't put in no work since Atari
Man you washed like the laundry
You a ex murderer like Ashanti
The back of the club that's where the Gods be
Bein all that we can be, me and my army
They said I can't rock a party
Gimme the mic I'm a rocket they better launch me
My music get judged harshly
Everybody makin comments they wanna blog me
Knowledge of the game they possess hardly
I call 'em a bunch of meatheads, like Archie
Haters say they wanna stomp me
I know how to weave and bob, no Marley
Get my way up out of the grave if I get bodied
Thuga Thuga they better bury me under concrete

[Outro: Papoose]
Yeah! King of New York!
Yeah! Yeah! I'm the King of New York!
Yeah! Yeah! I'm the King of New York!
Yeah nigga I'm the King of New York!
