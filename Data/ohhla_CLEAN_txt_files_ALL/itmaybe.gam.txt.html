[Ghostface Killah]
La la la la la (hey) yo
Hey world, this is Lollipop, raps for the sweet tooth
The real fiends who want that Ghostface and Sheek Louch
Big chain changlin charms, they be danglin
Eighty thou' worth the ice, I'll strangle 'em
My raw fishscale, paid the jeweler named Ishmael
Had the eagle fly back to my wrist, bigger chips
Bigger wings, bigger rings, I'm with the Childish Gambino
On that Eastwood shit, pushin a +Gran Turino+
Tarantino don't got, +Reservoir Dogs like mines
36 different niggaz with the same state of mind
Dirty Ghetto Kids lovin them haters
We got skaters that'll ox your whole face off; rob you like Madoff
Drug kingpins on the diet, we get that weight off
Real hood niggaz snatch ya bitch and clean your plate off
Gambino rap, cash money crack, table casino
Precision cut emeralds, sapphire visuals</pre>
