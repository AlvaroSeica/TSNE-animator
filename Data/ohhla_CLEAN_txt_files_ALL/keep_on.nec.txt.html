Somebody's waiting for you
Somewhere down the road
Keep on driving
Keep on driving
Keep on driving
Keep on driving

In a pickup truck, sick bikers escapees from Rikers snickering
Hicks with pitchforks picking up hitchhikers and tricking 'em, we likes it
Kill 'em like chickens with an ice pick

Run quickly you're in a snuff flick G, feed you to a pig, your wig eaten up
No need to dig, jigged up, bleeding from your ribs like squibs
I'll eat the brains of your kids kids

Male shovanist with a 'fro shall attack and sting you like a big cobra slapped'
You get trapped in my crib, in your grill like a jig camera wicking you like a wig
Shoot you up, you're puking up uranium, blasting your mom's dukes in the cranium
Insane asylum, sanitarium off the crazy train, I'm delirium in the vein again (AAAAH!)

You're being chased through the forest, by crazy faced coroners
with an amazing taste for blood like Tyrannosaurus, you're exhausted
Cut off your clitoris

Divorce your form, your orifice, force in a fist tortured with forceps
Nauseous from horse shit
A coughing rips your torso like a corset
Jucks multiple times, like shrapnel inside a war-vet
A crooked cult rhyme, assaulting a slime with the insulting rhyme
Get cooked from a jolt of voltage through your spine
Indulging in coldness, bitterness, cruelness, ruthless, vulgarness, OGRISH
Ghoulish when the full moon hits, the ultimate focus is who won't live!

Somebody's waiting for you
Somewhere down the road
Keep on driving
Keep on driving
Keep on driving
Keep on driving

You ran out of gas on a farm road and trespassed, now you're stabbed in your ass
with broken bottles choking on crushed lipo fill up your abdomen with glass and bust rifles
I'm pulling at your organs, organizing an orchestration of gore appreciation
deprivation, give a whore a feces facial, eat it raw defecation suffocation
you get smothered in anal, kill you like the brother of Abel

I'll make your mother my table, and shove an electrical cable in her intestinal navel
You just don't get it, you're find dead, naked, beheaded, your drowned head decapitated
and used for ???? on the sea bed, imbedded, a school of red snappers ate it then jet it
your corpse is a grizzly work of art
like a grizzly bear with a body part in his mouth eating like sizzla
Scissor teeth sharp like shattered mirrors in your heart by the wizard of incisions
Dead, but your nerves make you pop up like jack in a box, attack with an axe like a fox
Screaming like you're typing with CAPS LOCK on, fighting so bad your head whitening
Shoved on a meat hook, by a creep that looks like Meat Loaf
a big oaf, a mofo with a mole will [be] keeping your skull as a trophy
Skin on the sofa covered in fungus growth
Dumping you in a crawl space, I'm an off the wall nutcase
Rocking your face on my face while pumping Ace of Base
piece by piece disgrace your fate

Somebody's waiting for you
Somewhere down the road
Keep on driving
Keep on driving
Keep on driving
Keep on driving

They're watching you, talking with walkie talkies hawking you with binoculars
the cop killers creeping like Tarantulas, the Praying Mantis and Chinchillas
You go from being innocent and fearless to careless to brutally killed
like Todd Bridge's transition from being Willys to shacked up in a crack house with dealers
cracking your back with a black jack til you snap, your spine fractured
like a flashback reaction from mescaline cactus making your back twitch
your ass backwards

Warriors, the serial killer version
Put a blade to your dome when I invade your trailer home like a military incursion
and make you drink your urine

In a deserted desert I've pleasantly murdered, your vertebra is some perverted peasants
insert your gizzard the disgusting treasure forcing pheasant and buzzard
the mutants, molested night, on a nuclear testing site
like Wayne Newton giving your face ceramic plates, 'til you drip blood platelets

Leave you an eunuch, self mutilation, while Willy Nelson is playing on a radio station
on vacation don't take directions from a mental patient on medication
Asphyxiation fixated on hatred
Don't befriend a stranger
they got hidden agendas
rocking suspenders
to leave your appendix
chopped in a blender!

Somebody's waiting for you
Somewhere down the road
Keep on driving
Keep on driving
Keep on driving
Keep on driving

Someone will be there
Someone will be there</pre>
