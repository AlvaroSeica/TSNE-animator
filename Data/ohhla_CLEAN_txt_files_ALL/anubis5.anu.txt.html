My name is Stephen Moss, I was born in St. Catharines
When I turned fifteen I turned to rapping
I shot up through the rankings like a hot draft pick
On a couple of labels that I eagerly lost quick
Dropped a couple of albums man, you might have heard of me
I'm Anubis Five, a name you'd likely recognize
From the underground, I came up to rock this
Fresher than sushi comes this master of chopsticks
Kind of pompous but I've lost the arrogance
My body absorbed through the audio and the ambience
Street hip hop is revolution
Frequency graffiti through words, world solution
Oozing with verve and lunar energy
Comes with great responsibility of being an emcee
Bombing songs with culture imbedded inside of me
I walk overtop the planet with a knapsack of CD's

There's no greater high than rocking a song live
The bass shakes the blueprints from which I was designed
I'm Anubis Five
I'm Anubis Five
I'm Anubis Five

Dropping science like a biology teacher
My ears ring like telephones from the pounding of speakers
Eager to stand up and blaze with intuition 
Bizarre beligerence from preaching star division
Canada connect with France
Beats of beauty contrasted with my ample raps
So heavy flow like a fatcap spraycan
Ready to go like Tommy Lee Jones rocking fresh Ray Bans
Bam bap, back at it again
Power surge hits the nerve and I'm rattling cans
I'm damaging reps to local preps
That claim hip hop as their own but missed the major steps
Tripping over something not fresh
If you know me I only rock a set to death
And when the mic hits the hand that's it
Get showered by fresh napalm that keeps the stage lit

There's no greater high than rocking a song live
The bass shakes the blueprints from which I was designed
I'm Anubis Five
I'm Anubis Five
I'm Anubis Five

Igniting in my time like a proximity mine
My tongue ever so divine as my domepiece shines
Niagara region representer
Prepare to get bandaged if you're a territory half stepper
I'm not a shy guy, I explode out the boombox
Restraining myself consists of keeping my lips locked
But then I drip drop like a fresh piece
Vocal spray all over canvas, mad peace to RC
Bringing hip back to feed my family
GalvaMega heat firing the fresh artillery
Inspecting the tapedeck is a safe bet
Step onto the scene, it gets hectic like a train wreck
Training to sound so outstanding
Find me in Shamrock Meats pounding my fists against cow ribs
Digging up my past to shed light upon creation
Number five the genesis to the revelation</pre>
