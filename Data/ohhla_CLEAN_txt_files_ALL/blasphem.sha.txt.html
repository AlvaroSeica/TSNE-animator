Sometimes I look to the sky
and I wonder what the Heaven is goin' on
Who else can I ask?
But you!
Damn, damn, damn, damn God!

[Verse 1]
How can you be so calm when there's armies dropping bombs overseas
and there's war going on right here that no one sees?
Little dude gotta starve, rob to get some groceries
and shorty's scared to be a Mom, she disrupting her ovaries
I'm sayin' Damn damn damn God can't you find a job for my people?
yo they robbed all my peoplewe don't get no reparations
for segregationthe legislation passed for the Rico law we be so poor
We take afflictions of the addicted and serve 'em
and keep 'em sick and it's hurting so we get rich and it's workin'
but when you flip and reverse it, they lock us up like we purchased
and brought it over to service, the system's set up on purpose
why you do that? You coulda just made us one color like the Smurfs
You don't think that woulda worked?
Go to church why? Pray where? Who gon' help us?
You got Heaven dog, you so selfish
That's what we be thinkin', that's what I be thinkin' a man dies everyday
the same time a baby's born, now do we cry or celebrate?
how can Muslims pray to Allah to bring down the towers?
Are there words in the Quran that gave them more power?
Was the Bible just devised so slavery stayed alive
and niggas would pray for Heaven to come after they died?
Do you love White people more?
I ain't throwin' salt but Goddamn this is all your fault blast for me now

[Chorus 2X]
Damn, damn, damn, damn God
How the hell can life be so hard?
Now Got damn, damn, I say the Lord's name in vein
Hoping one day He could ease my pain

[Verse 2]
Ok maybe I'm buggin', but nobody else is gonna ask
how can stray bullets cross the path
of innocent people?
And who's innocent? A baby unborn?
Condom popped, and now I want my son gone?
But ain't that murder? It's not right
we could look but don't touch, we could touch but don't taste
why you put shit in our face?
How the hell you make sex feel better than eating
but one slip and that could dead us from breathing?
Tell me the reason
you made guns, made war I ain't blaming Eve and Adam
let me know the point of me even rapping
'cause nobody listens, and sex sells
I was asking my label if they can help me get hot
and they told me get shot
I don't believe in the devil, though the Bible said it's him
Making people kill people, making men choose men
to lay with, on some gay shit, you made it possible
what's the answer for cancer? we lay up in the hospital Damn!
God you created this shit, we here and gotta stay in this shit
Mad religions, Catholics, Christians, Baptists, listen
I'm just trying to keep my ass out of prison
are you catching my drift or am I tripping?
God I know when I was 7
I believed in Santa Claus and I thought there was a Heaven
but now I don't give a damn, so I give a verse
can I get an answer before I'm in a hearse huh?
