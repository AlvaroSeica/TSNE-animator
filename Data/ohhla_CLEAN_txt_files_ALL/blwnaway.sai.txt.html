[Intro: Saigon]
Free all political prisoners
Even though a lot of y'all are lucky to be prisoners
Because you know what happens to most people that step up?
They get blown awayyyyyyy - damn right (bang)

[Saigon]
Martin Luther King had more than a dream
He was out for social change and that sort of a thing
Tried to lead us to freedom but before it would ring
He got blown awayyyyyyy (got blown away)
He seen a problem and thought that he had the answer probably
And that's the reason that Huey started the Panther Party
Wasn't for Hoover he'd be alive today (but bang)
He got blown awayyyyyyy (blown away)
That man Clarence Smith was like a father to many
Was for the love cause the brother wasn't offered a penny
He said the black man was God and it costed him plenty
Was at the time it wasn't no police officers friendly
He birthed the Five-Percent Nation, called 'em the True and Livin'
And just for that you know they whupped him and threw him in prison
Wasn't for them then he'd be with us today (but bang)
He got blown awayyyyyyy
Marvin Gaye wrote a song called "What's Goin' On?"
The label said no but he convinced them to go along
He spoke of Vietnam and the shit that was goin wrong
Tryin to convince people that they need to keep holdin on
He sang "Mercy Mercy Me" it felt like he was cryin
He wanted to save the hood, they understood why he was tryin
He took a stand and said what he had to say (bang)
He got blown awayyyyyyy
Tupac Shakur was more than a rapper
More than an actor, it was more than awards he was after
He tried to teach young black people a better way (bang)
He got blown awayyyyyyy - ay
You gotta give it to him, Abraham Lincoln was honest
He was a racist but he did what he said when he promised
He freed slaves, of course he was gon' pay
He got blown awayyyyyyy
John F. Kennedy fought for the people
A white president that wanted to see all of us equal
At least that's what he said when runnin for office to beat dude
But then he run, and he start doin more for the people
Assassin hit him with a bullet that tore his cerebral
I know a lot of y'all are thinkin we wanna believe you
Black people pray for J.F.K. (but bang!)
He got blown awayyyyyyy - same way
Gosh, I can't forget Peter Tosh
If Bob Marley was Jigga then Tosh'll be Nas
Peter was Bob's right hand man, one hand washed
the other, these brothers wanted more than to just be large
Killer on the guitar, but better up on the mic
Y'all remember that revolutionary shit he would write
Like, "Get Up, Stand Up" - stand up for your right
But bang, he got blown awayyyyyyy - you're damn right
Martin Luther King had more than a dream
He was out for social change and that sort of a thing
Tried to lead us to freedom but before it would ring
He got blown awayyyyyyy (he got blown away)
Tupac Shakur was more than a rapper
More than an actor, it was more than awards he was after
Tried to teach young black people a better way
He got blown awayyyyyyy
Then there was Saigon, I brought you "The Greatest Story"
I know they watchin me and I know that they waitin for me
I just pray that y'all heed what I had to say
before I get blown awayyyyyyy</pre>
