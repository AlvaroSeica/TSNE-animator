Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Don't need no reason to give
don't need no reason or why
don't really care what you think
Just live your life in the right
and if you call it a game
Look around and you'll see
A lot of people are hungry
and there looking to eat
Don't think about what you got
or what you cannot afford
before you roll to the store
just change the labels before
you leave a check at the stand
knowing your screwing the man
because he'd fucking with you
and now you've had it

Is it something in the way you move
Got me thinking that my minds abusing
Is it something in the way you say
that we thinking this is living today

Cause all the things that you be thinking out loud
don't necessarily matter if your running your mouth
because you never really know who you be talking about
he could be crazy enough to pull a gun and be out

Don't think about the things that you know must be wrong
and if you're moving along
you must be feeling as strong
and if you think about the things
that you know must be right
while your wowing and bowin
to get up while you get up in it

Is it something in the way you move
Got me thinking that my minds abusing
Is it something in the way you say
that we thinking this is living today</pre>
