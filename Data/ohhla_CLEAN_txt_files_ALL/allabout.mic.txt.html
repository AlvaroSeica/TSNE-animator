[Intro: Bless]
Let's go
It's the Pop, motherfucker
Iron Mic, 12 Rounds
Daze this motherfucker, knock him out

[Iron Mic]
Aiyo, we throw slugs, we throwin' 'em back, especially
If he suspect, we buck back, nah, nigga, fuck that
I live the thug life, nigga, I give you thug raps
Most these rappers is lying, the streets want facts
They wanna know how we do it in the hood
How we continously, keep it Ruthless in the hood
It's Ruthless, drug dealers, shooters in the hood
And corrupt police, so get away if you could
We starving, boy, we hiding in the woods
Waiting for you to slip, so we can get you for you goods
Soon as the nigga, trip, man I'mma chop him and his dudes
Nigga, you see the tools, give up the money and the jewels
They don't teach this in the school, you better learn about the rules
And 'em, Ruthless boys, they known to act a fool
Vanilla Ice ya'll rappers, hang they ass from the roof
I advise ya to move, or get blown out ya shoe

[Chorus 2X: Iron Mic]
Yeah, it's all about the come up, nigga
So in the mean time, I'mma keep my gun up, nigga
I smoke green lime, til the sun come up, nigga
Keep a clean nine, I dare you to run up, nigga

[Iron Mic]
They told me live for the day, I might not see tomorrow
So I'mma make sure my enemies, see the mottos
No role model, when they see me, take a seat, don't follow
We wilding, get hit on your head with a hemrock bottle
The Island's full of H, boy, don't get trapped in
Play the field, boy, my niggas put back work in
Beat ya ass to death like my gat ain't working
Til you ain't walking, we straight New Yorking
The dude from Philly, they found him swimming in Boston
Decomposed, just enough for his coffin
He didn't listen, when I told his ass keep on walking
It's real, life music, we ain't joking, and still
We'll hit you if you get out of line, and I'mma
Real nigga, you should keep that in mind, don't mind a
I'm a grown man, nigga it's Iron, the honor
Ruthless, like my mother and father, the drama
That's something you don't want
I put my life on these songs, while you put up a front, the drama
That's something you don't want
I put my life on these songs, while you put up a front

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: Bless]
We told y'all
Pick this stupid motherfucker up and drag him up out of here
It's the Pop, stupid, Iron Mic</pre>
