[Nine]
I enter, the center of the cypha
Blunts and lighter, the ruff rhyme writer Nine
Skills up the koolu, I do you like voodoo
Pins in the mojo, oh no!
Eyes are red, I'm high again
You wan' try again, die again my friend, one less than ten
Eight plus one me, N-I-N-E
Name up in lights G, I'm hype G, all night G
Can't no man step in my cypha
(Heard up, word up!)  Pay the piper
Who rocks the party?  Nine rocks the party
Make you move your body, in trunks like John Gotti
I got the strength of ten MC's on steroids
Rappers are paranoid, my cypha ain't a safe place to be G
I cruise avenues, stomp blue suede shoes
I can't lose, mashin crews to pay my dues

	The Cypha
	"Get frisked, just in order to get in.."
	The Cypha
	"Get frisked, just in order to get in.."
	The Cypha
	"Get frisked, just in order to get in.."
	The Cypha
	"Get frisked, just in order to get in.."

[Nine]
One sucker, two sucker, three suckers, fo' suckers
Bring mo' suckers, punk muh'fuckers
Talkin bout you can't feel my style, I can't feel you either
but I bet yo' ass feel this meat cleaver
(Swing swing swing, chop chop!) You gonna drop
I can't wait to see you fall off, in the pig slop
Pop, went the gat, drop, went the fat
slob that tried to diss, NAH nigga can touch this
Cheese-eatin, tapdancin Sambo - don't push your luck
Brand new nigga and I will go Rambo (POW)
Tryin to break my cypha is suicide
+Passin Me By+ like I'm the Pharcyde
Give respect, recognize, give props where props are due
before me and my crew come and murder you
This ain't no game, it's about eatin, payin rent
and (tings like dat) you nah wan' test me black

	The Cypha
	"Get frisked, just in order to get in.."
	The Cypha
	"Get frisked, just in order to get in.."
	The Cypha
	"Get frisked, just in order to get in.."
	The Cypha
	"Get frisked, just in order to get in.."

[Nine]
Game recognize game all the time
Who's your man, with the wack ass rhyme?
You must be stupid, I was doin this before you hit
puberty, you think your style's original - it ain't new to me
Save it, for David, easy back it up
I got O.J. Simpson's knife right at your gut
I do you like your name was Nicole
When I roll headspins niggaz drop like Ronald Goldman
My cypha's complete without you your wack crew
your wack beats, Nine moves feets
Act like you know homo -- I get around
Nine comes back like a pro
Ich, ni, son, shi, MC's, can't touch me
No matter how much weight you push you're still lighter
when you enter my cypha

	The Cypha
	"Get frisked, just in order to get in.."
	The Cypha
	"Get frisked, just in order to get in.."
	The Cypha
	"Get frisked, just in order to get in.."

	"Get frisked, just in order to get in.."</pre>
