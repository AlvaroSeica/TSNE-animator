"There's no love to be found..."

[Intro: Li-Mouse]
No love to be found... wooooooo
Check it out, go in!

[Cno Evil]
Cno's here, you hear the cheers? Yo, bartender, pass the beer
I smell fear, see the tears, flowing down right past your ear
First things first, let's get it clear, drive the hearse to end careers
Star Trek: Final Frontier, flying in your atmosphere
Noble like the kid Sincere, Paul Revere is coming near
No more darts, we throwing spears, switching gears to killing deers
I'm the auctioneer, beware, I'm sorta like the engineer
Volunteer, then disappear, this is so severe
I knew this girl who was rare, chocolate like an eclair
In the bitch like pap smears, then examining her rear
Reappear, then she stare, she love playing solitaire
I love playing truth or dare, winning Slumdog Millionaire
The husband that is unaware, close your eyes and say a prayer
Fuck you up like St. Pierre, then I'm having an affair
Cover of Vanity Fair, where you gay, looking queer
Crash your car with no repair, leave you scarred, pulling hair
Murphy Daddy Day Care, didn't teach me how to share
So I'm giving you my spare, have an apple or a pear
Can't compare to no one there, what you saying every year
This I swear, I declare, got you sitting in a chair
Walk on air, don't you care, I enlighten like Voltaire
Call me Mr. Grizzly Bear or the Captain Buck O'Haire
Chilling in a public square, hiding in the dragon's lair
Fix your face with dental care, give me cash for taxi fare
Tap dancing down the stairs, like my name is Fred Astaire
Nature Boy like Ric Flair, dressed up in my Wu-Wear
It's OK, give a glare, at the Rodent rapping pair
Drummer boy, bang on snare, this is how we do it, yeah

[Outro: Li-Mouse]
Oh shit, saw that? Shit was like a UFO or something, son
Damn, shit's crazy, fucking, on some weather balloon shit, son

[kung fu sample]
You ought to learn how to deal with the throwing knives
	You must, teach me</pre>
