In my life I've seen scenes
Tailor made for movie screens
Friends flip to enemies
And dream upon me injuries
Cash low
This is me
The asshole
Vividly remember things
fast glow
The memories usually past slow
I rose from out the water where the thugs drown
Momma wanted a daughter
And my father couldn't ever put the drugs down
Lived through empty promises dun
Was showed the path by the honor less ones
Moms never told a lie tho
I realized the fate of some men
Just use ya real eyes
The pain'll come in
You see they real lives

I had confidence issues
I couldn't conquer them simple
So it turned into a monster my mental
There's an inner me I've blocked from the pencil
To keep the outer presentable
Sometimes I wanna shout in my interviews
But who'll hear me
I'm less of a man if my jewels teary
So I sit alone and play groove theory
In my life
I rarely said thank you but there's a few people I owe a thank you too
My aunts and my uncles I'd like to thank you too
You can act like you don't know why but I think you do
The world don't revolve around me
Ya'll think I think it do
See my life aint been a crystal stair
All the time feeling like I missed the fair
The name of life aint mr fair
I move slow like its troubling to switch the gears
When I speak on me
I'm not just trying to get you scared

In my life I had friends I coulda saved from they fates
Do it again and I'd have taken they place
But
I learned life shies from making mistakes
That's why I might cry but take it as hey
What can you do right
I used to open my pad and write by the moonlight
Now I keep those feelings inside
Wrapped in cocoons tight
I read a story bout black thought
He keeps in his pocket
All the tragedy he faced in his life
I see his logic
See it's tough for me to spill out to ya'll cats
Personal issues of what I've been through
I aint ready for all that
I'm one of those guys who gave his heart to a woman
During candid conversation and the chick never called back
In my lifeâ¦</pre>
