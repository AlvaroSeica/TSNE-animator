[Intro: Lil Mama]
When you hear Left Eye
When you hear Lil Mama (Shake it down now)
You know its time to get busy
So it aint really much too talk about
How was it working with her?
It was an honor

[Verse 1: Lisa Lopes]
Remember way back in the day (hey hey)
When the kids from around the way
Used to come out and play
And the double dutch bus
Had you bumpin' on down the street
Tryin' to move your feet
While you shake your little booty
To the groove of the beat (uh)
To the beat
To the beat (beat)
You hit the corner and you stopped
Hey y'all there's a party on the other block
We hit the jackpot
Jackpot (what what)
And it's only 12 o'clock
And the sun is hot
Free soda pop
We about to rock rock rock rock...

[Chorus: Clyde McKnight]
Everybody come on
Its about time, that we had a good time
So go put on your clothes and meet me right back downstairs
We BBQin and playing music
Double dutchin, and hula hoopin
Call everybody you know
And tell them we bout to have a
Block party, a block party (Hey)
Block party, a block party (Come on everybody)
Block party, a block party (Hey)
Block party, a block party (Come on everybody)

[Hook: Little Girls]
We were dancing all night long
We were dancing all night long
Music pumping and we're jumping
And theyre playin our favorite songs
We were dancing all night long
We were dancing all night long
Music pumping and we're jumping
And theyre playin our favorite songs

So I can teach you
Teach you

[Verse 2: Lil Mama]
The electric
Even the people across seas got respect this
Hear ya check this, what been around
Pop up, like Im aroun now
I know you like my style
Burgers on the grill flip up and down
Girls rock jeans thats fitting now
The boys on the block
That like your smile
He aint got to act like that
He be likin my style more than he like my bag
He. Aint. Got. To. Act. Like. That.
He. Like. My. Style. More. Than. He. Like. My. Bag.

Best believe we have to whole block
Rockin

[Chorus: Clyde McKnight]
Everybody come on
Its about time, that we had a good time
So go put on your clothes and meet me right back downstairs
We BBQin and playing music
Double dutchin, and hula hoopin
Call everybody you know
And tell them we bout to have a
Block party, a block party (Hey)
Block party, a block party (Come on everybody)
Block party, a block party (Hey)
Block party, a block party (Come on everybody)

[Hook: Lisa Lopes]
I'm a big city girl
From all over the world
And I do what I wanna do
Right foot left shoe
Then you take it on down
Then you shake it around
Bring it up
Clap your hands
Then you turn it all around

[Verse 3: Lil Mama]
Now you got to this
Now you got to that
When it comes to track
Yall aint got to ask
Im shalack
Like Vanagon wax
And I spitdadada
That flow on wax
Like that, in the middle of the block party
Watch the way I just rock baby
Roll
Control
I think its betta when you rock baby
If not, you might look like a player
If aint a player, babygirl youre a hater
Haters get no respect
And I disrespect any hate on me
I aint check
Talk about cash
Anything else, I dont talk about that
I dont rock purse
No, I dont rock bag
No I am constantly infinity cash flow
So lets go

[Chorus: Clyde McKnight]
Everybody come on
Its about time, that we had a good time
So go put on your clothes and meet me right back downstairs
We BBQin and playing music
Double dutchin, and hula hoopin
Call everybody you know
And tell them we bout to have a
Block party, a block party (Hey)
Block party, a block party (Come on everybody)
Block party, a block party (Hey)
Block party, a block party (Come on everybody)
Block party, a block party (Hey)
Block party, a block party (Come on everybody)
Block party, a block party (Hey)
Block party, a block party (Come on everybody)</pre>
