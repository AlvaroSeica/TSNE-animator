1991, Deliver hits by the tongue (AK)
Son of a gun, what you want
Turn it up, pump up this shit
Infinite all day and shit
I see fools hanging out at the corner
we know no lickses played out licks
Once I was top 10 to porterflick
Champain caught up in the mix
Dance! put yourself passatoos
Radio Mass got nothing to lose
We don't need no educacion
what we need is a radio station

(Chorus)
All I see is all I get I stole the music with no regreats
All I want that's all I need I'm a thief I stole the beat

[Rigorod]
Just me whaap, In no around in the clock (THE MASS)
Broadcast what you need (NON STOP)
Shall we all got faithed this a meditop
Rigo with never comache (comache)
And with this winning team
Each mate putties spells, lady SCREAM!!!!
Yeah thats what we need quit or the women will succeed
Mc's bleed, suffer like hell
Made mic's explode like mother dot cocktails
Well, it ain't hard to tell like winning ya
barabarapa barabarapa and let me say it again

(Chorus)
All I see is all I get I stole the music with no regreats
All I want that's all I need I'm a thief I stole the beat {*2X*}
I'm a thief I stole the beat {*2X*}

[Women](Rigo and Cham)
This is radiomass (Tracks from the future tracks from the past)
This is radiomass (I'm a thief I stole the beat)
This is radiomass (Tracks from the future tracks from the past)
This is radiomass
This is radiomass (I'm a thief I stole the beat)

(Chorus)
All I see is all I get I stole the music with no regreats
