DJ On Point, Joe Budden, Mood Muzik 3

[Verse 1 - Joe Budden]
Look, come and cruise with me
I'm good in any hood, no matter who's with me
My mind on +Gettin Money+, bumpin new 50
Or my mind was off music, 'til Clue hit me
And told me keep it on the booth strictly (oh!)
So I step in, watchin my surroundings and my settings
Then I let the Percocet set in
Rough year, lost five of my homeboys
I ain't worried 'bout it, y'all alive (y'all alive), just home boy
I feel like I'm the last real nigga left (or)
Maybe all the real niggaz just left (come on)
We growin extinct, we like dinosaurs
There's only a few exceptions, so minus y'all (uh)
The greatest rapper alive (uh), is wearin suits and ties (uh)
So you got a bunch of whack niggas sayin they him
Used to be if you strive for somethin you could achieve it
Now just say shit, these niggaz'll believe it (AH!)
I'm done screamin out "Jump Off rules!"
Lost my girl, broke all of my Jump Off rules
Kept fuckin the side chick, so a nigga lied more
Picked her up in the woman's car, that I ride for her
Creepin, I would hide more (oh)
Got confused as to who I'm 'sposed to fight for (oh)
I can't even blame the jump, it was my fault (why?)
'Cause I gave her the gun and she killed the only bitch I would die for (AH!)
So the noise is called for
When you goin through T's type of Pain dog, ya voice gets altered (OH!)
Know it's hard to stay calm, gonna need State Farm
When you fuckin with a con no, not Akon (let's go!)
I'm high off life, a walkin napalm
Fastballs comin at 'em from a Dice-K arm (from a Dice-K arm)
Ridin suspended L
No wonder I'm on fire, I already been through Hell
So, when the the World's against you well
Naw, I never snitch but I'll let the pencil tell
I suffer from wrong thinkin (so?)
So I avoid straitjackets and the bitch that dumped Sean Kingston (uhh)
Better they respect you than to fear you
I learnt that +Staring At The World In My Rearview+
But come get me cocksucker, I dare you
Rather box a felon than a nigga that's fearful (Understand somethin)
Want a clear view, without a clear view
I put the wall up but thoughts just tear through
God I hear you, givin me a earful (but)
But I'm a cruise in 5th gear until I'm near you (DJ On Point) (oh!)
Eye of a Tiger, naw a Sniper with great aim
I won't be another great slain (nigga!), takes flames, embrace pain
Ask Eddie Griffin, you gon' lose everytime goin up against a freight train (AH!)
Niggaz bleed like us, we in the same World
Keep the Patr√≥n comin, try and make the day hurl (oh)
It's a few niggaz checkin out my chain pearls
Go ahead, try and lift somethin that you can't curl
Far from "Wayne's World"
If life's a bitch, it ain't just R. Kelly and Ush' fuckin the +Same Girl+ (nope)
O.G. swag, walk got a limp in it
It's my World, everybody's payin rent in it
I left Jersey, I took flight on 'em
Dudes tried to take the crown, (dog) didn't look right on 'em (naw!)
How you gon' fuck with a crook, heist warn 'em?
Play Vanilla Ice, I get Suge Knight on 'em
Meanest Porsches, gleamin crosses
Came from Queens to restore this, deemed it in orbit
When the red carpet rolled out, that mean it's bosses
Don't get it fucked up, we had fiends before this (oh)
My third eye sharp, so keen it's gorgeous (oh)
I've seen it all, even Halloween in August (talk to 'em)
Gun in my hand
The game used to make you sell ya soul, now it gotta come with a dance
I'm on the clear view (whoa!), without a clear view (oh!)
I put the wall up but thoughts just tear through (oh!)
God I hear you, givin me a earful
But I'm a cruise in 5th gear until I'm near you (AH! oh!)

[Outro - Joe Budden - talking]
Uh, it's, it's, it's that On Top Music

[DJ On Point - talking over Outro and until the end]
Shout to my nigga Ferris Bueller
Can't forget Hip Hop Heaven out in Iowa
My nigga Dame Philly in Miami</pre>
