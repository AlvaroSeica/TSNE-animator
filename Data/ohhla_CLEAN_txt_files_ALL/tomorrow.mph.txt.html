[Intro: Muph] {X2}
Let's go (let's go), and move with life
Let it go (let it go), somethin new tonight

[Verse 1: Muph]
Keys in the ignition, sittin, thinkin about how driven I
feel - tonight, cruis-in by
Twistin the pistons and envision what the distance and the
fu-ture's like, move with life
Let's quit this job, say a final farewell to the big boss
Toss these bags in the boot and shoot through to Inverloch
Maybe I've bitten off more than I can chew, left over shoe
on the bitumen from the last victim who didn't seem to have a clue
Phew, just missed a Subaru, out of tune with a dotted line
While I was out of tune with a stop sign
Cop a fine here or there, that's life like life isn't fair
Visit wherever there's a spare couch and a deckchair
Slippery when wet, there is a death stare
So now I prepare to stop, bring it on

[Chorus: Pete Lawler]
Livin like there's no tomorrow, and then tomorrow came
"Goin all out" {*Scratched by DJ Bonez*}
Road less travelled, may add up to change
"Goin all out" {*Scratched by DJ Bonez*}
Livin like there's no tomorrow, and then tomorrow came
...And then tomorrow came

[Verse 2: Muph]
Huh, c'mon
I'ma break through the roadblocks, no stops
means no park and no gettin towed off
Toes on the pedal in my stonewash jeans
Soak up heavy metal on the radio stream
Bumps gettin brushed up against the windscreen
Wind down the window and listen to the wind scream
Lift me up, merge right, proceed with caution
Deep breath, now ease into the cornering
Exhaustion is behind me, travellin at ninety
Blindly let the road expose itself, guide me
Switch on the high beams, missing the signage
Just tryna find things so I'm applyin the brakes
Made a mistake, wrong way, turn back
Concerned that I'm still on my first lap
Hook turns weren't on my blurred map
Churnin that engine, speed bumps
Work that suspension, swervin emergency exits

[Chorus with variations: Pete Lawler]
Livin like there's no tomorrow, and then tomorrow came
...
Livin like there's no tomorrow, and then tomorrow came
"Goin all out" {*Scratched by DJ Bonez*}
Road less travelled, may add up to change
...
Livin like there's no tomorrow, and then tomorrow came
"Goin all out" {*Scratched by DJ Bonez*}
I was livin like there's no tomorrow, and then tomorrow came
...
I got the wake up call, laughin through the window frame
"Goin all out" {*Scratched by DJ Bonez*}
I was livin like there's no tomorrow, but then tomorrow came
"Goin all out" {*Scratched by DJ Bonez*}
I took the road less travelled, cause it may up to change
...
I was livin like there's no tomorrow, but then tomorrow came
...And then tomorrow came
...And then tomorrow came
Livin like there's no tomorrow, and then tomorrow came</pre>
