[Soulja Boy]
My flow sicker
Your dough thick, well my dough thicker
You talk shit, I will kick yo' door nigga
I call my goons
My brand new chopper is comin soon

[50 Cent]
AK-47 got 'em dialin nine-eleven
I pull that trigger, y'all fuck with my lil' nigga
I come through get'cha
Hop out them hollows hit ya
Keep thinking it's a game, niggaz ain't playin

[Soulja Boy]
Soulja Boy I'll bust your brain
Nigga talkin all that shit y'all niggaz cannot represent
Fucking with the youngest killer, youngest gorilla nigga
Split ya I deal wit'cha

[50 Cent]
Knife sticker, ice picker
Run for your life nigga, I won't tell ya twice
Bitch go run do the Dougie, all the gangsters they love me
These hoes they be all on me, they can't help that they want me
They want me back

[Soulja Boy]
I'm on another level
Bitch you heard me say that didn't you?
S.O.D. I never mentioned you because you not worthy

[50 Cent]
Yeah we royalty don't talk to me
Bitch, you not worthy

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
Mean mug; nigga you gon mug who?
Rob me? Bigga we gon rob you
Choppers on me, niggaz we don't give a fuck
I'm in the club, nigga fuck your mean mugs
Fuck your mean mug, nigga, fuck your mean mug {*4X*}

[50 Cent]
When I'm trippin, I'm twisted, I slap my clip in
When I flip, hoe duck down, when I start hittin
I'm iced out, bitch my neck and my ears drippin
I lost count, all this paper I be gettin

[Soulja Boy]
Any fuckin game nigga pass me the ball
And watch a nigga ball, I'm Gucci to the drawers
I'm money over all, I don't really give a fuck
Tatted on my neck and throat, and them girls lick me up

[50 Cent]
Lick me up, 'til I pop, shawty swallow, e'ry drop
From the balls, to the top, she must, do this, shit a, lot
She's a freak, she's a pro, got that paper, it's a go
Bring the kush, burn the 'dro, she might bless ya, on the low

[Soulja Boy]
Man, that's why I picked you up off the ground
If you make a fuckin sound, disrespect my fuckin crew
Bitch is you a fuckin clown? Get the fuck back nigga we up in the club
High as fuck, talk shit and you gon get dropped!!

[Chorus]

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Yeah, misery loves company nigga
I send you to see yo' dead motherfuckin homies
Come right close to you, 187 to most of you
Chop choppin out the window
Fuck is the matter with yo' face nigga?
What the fuck is you lookin at?
I will spin that motherfuckin barrel at you nigga
Try me, OOOOH~! I want you to try me nigga!</pre>
