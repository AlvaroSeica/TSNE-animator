um yes, pardon me

Oh what elegance in Vietnam they bombed the elephants
guns shots sound like scatting from Ella Fitz
Louie's blowing his bugle
its wake up time for the army ants
I would be sad if all this was real
I'm smiling cause this life is temporary
and so fantastic

I don't know what I've been told
in fantastic you never grow old
I don't know what I've been told
when I die I keep my soul
I don't know what I've been told
in fantastic there is no war
I don't know what I've been told
in fantastic nobodies poor

this is for general Walter E. Kurtz
agent orange, dead trees, kids with guns and vets that are rich</pre>
