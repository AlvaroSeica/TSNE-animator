Song:   Nothin Over Me
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

you got
nothing over me
you can't
tell me what to do
you say
you're sick and tired of me
I say
I'm sick and tired of you
you ain't got nothing over me
you got
nothing over me
you can't
tell me what to do
you say
you're sick and tired of me
I say
I'm sick and tired of you
you ain't got nothing over me
you got
nothing over me
you can't
tell me what to do
you say
you're sick and tired of me
I say
I'm sick and tired of you
you ain't got nothing over me</pre>
