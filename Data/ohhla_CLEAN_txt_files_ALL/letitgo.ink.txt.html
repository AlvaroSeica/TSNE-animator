Song:   Let It Go
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
I let go, but I cling
To a love I've never seen
Give me faith
It feels like I've just opened the doors
I steal although nothing ever comes for free
This world is watching me

But I wake up in the morning thinking fuck it all
Fucking raw
I feel so fucking tall
That they just look like ants and I could crush 'em all
I'm a beast with a bark like a dozen dogs
Only time I see the sun is when the money call
Who's in charge? You can put that on my credit card
Money over bitches I don't need 4 hoes to set it off
But there's a couple things that's on my chest I need to get em off
I'm just being honest niggas can't touch me like granny old china
I'm the tyrant, baby T-Rex
Fuck walking I can run this shit in three steps

[Chorus]
I let go, but I cling
To a love I've never seen
Give me faith
It feels like I've just opened the doors
I steal although nothing ever comes for free
This world is watching me

Crazy world, full of fame addicts
I spent a couple hundred on a straight jacket
Trying to get high, each and every day
Hit this and a nigga might fly away
I think I'm Bruce Wayne, Batman
On these niggas heads, like a CAT scan
Dominate like Pac-Man
You in a hole, where Shaq stand
I'm a madman, fuck you smiley face
Only thing I know, is to annihilate
All competition, I'm at a steady pace
In this human race it's nothing new to take

[Chorus]
I let go, but I cling
To a love I've never seen
Give me faith
It feels like I've just opened the doors
I steal although nothing ever comes for free
This world is watching me

Yeah
So Imma just roll up another one
And let time fly
Oh yeah
Fuck you haters!
Look up
See me?

[Chorus]
I let go, but I cling
To a love I've never seen
Give me faith
It feels like I've just opened the doors
I steal although nothing ever comes for free
This world is watching me</pre>
