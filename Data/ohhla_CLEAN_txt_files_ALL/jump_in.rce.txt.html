[Male]
Kay everybody, shut the fuck up
Quiet down
I brought you hear today
These four putos say they're ready
I don't know, we're gonna see
Got S.G.
Panic
Luna
And Grant Rice
Vamos aver, ese
Cause once you're in, you're in
Empire
Es por vida, ese
It's forever...

Chorus: The Empire
Empire
Tell 'em that we here
Hands in the air, we ain't going nowhere
This is Empire
Tell 'em that we here
Hands in the air, we ain't going nowhere

(Verse 1)
[S.G.]       Out the train, live native, also westside related
             Kansas City born wetback
             Mexicano pushin' trente
             Heinos in the cycle, y'all was worried that I might go
             Psycho in the time slow when recording in my silo
[Luna]       Mr. Luna, A.K.A. Mr. Fuck-Yo-Ass-Up (Come here!)
             Run your mouth
             Find yourself
             Tied up from the trunk
             It's just a fact
             Me and my dudes don't know how to act
             You can't react
             When this strap says BBBRAT
             BBBRAT...
[Panic]      Mr. Maniacal
             Panic, the reason they runnin' scared
             Got turrets
[All]        FUCK ASS!
[Panic]      Psychotically unimpaired
             Came to battle with my brothers, the four of us back to back
             Wanna see if we got wuebos, we swingin' when they attack
[Grant Rice] I'm G. Rice
             Greased lightin' that speed like
             A Datoya 500 while I'm truckin' through a green light
             Eastside leaves, white trash, and spit
             And best believe it, now repeat it after this
             It goes

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
[Grant Rice] I'm a
             L.B.B.
             Empire Regimer
             That same breathes that shit, that stays with tech and nina
             I'm back, so pathetic
             If I said it
             Then I meant it
             Get a medic, with anesthetics
             Grant's gotta have something to shred
[Panic]      I'm Empire mad seller, s'ain't a gang, it's a legions (We legions)
             An army with a reason to blade 'em, keep 'em from breathin'
             We got wetbacks, got niggas and white trash
             It ain't about your skin, it's 'bout kicking your ass
[Luna]       You're in the danger zone, you shouldn't hang so long
             Get knocked out, then make up before your paper gone
             We the sickest click, middle finger to all the haters
             Talkin' shit
             We got dudes crazier than Al Queda
[S.G.]       S.G. the cholo, loco vato from Missouri
             You'll get buried in the park, while I'm sportin' all your jewelery
             I learned there's still a delta 88 when I was 12
             Did it well in Armadale, I took a part and tried to sell

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
[Luna]       It's especially painful when I send you to meet the angels
             Body, thoughts are mangled, then pulled apart
             From every angel
             Empire, original, critical how we get at you
             West Port Elise, best believe, we can get rid of you (Come on)
[S.G.]       You can't fuck with a vato like me
             I'll make you bleed if need be, just try and see (Aight)
             Mira cabron, I'm never sleeping alone
             I got a bitch that spits hollow tips, protectin' my home
[Grant Rice] Life in the trap is all I know, I turned a half into a whole
             Action packed, rats assassin with a magnum back and hold
             Position, I ain't givin' not a inch of what you know
             About a kitchen, whippin' chickens, tryin' to get ya scratch and grow
[Panic]      It's our turn, we last a minute, we in it for fuckin' life
             Wipe the blood up out my face, get back in it, fist up and fight
             Twenty seconds left, adrenaline pumpin', no time to tire
             From now on, you see the clicka sound to call
[All]        EMPIRE! (This is)

Repeat Chorus Twice
