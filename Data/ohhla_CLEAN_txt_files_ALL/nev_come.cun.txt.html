Song:   Never Come Down (The Brownie Song)
Typed by: timm2014@hotmail.com

"I can't stop" (Never)
"I can't stop" (I've tried)
"I can't stop" (Can't stop)

[Chorus] [x2]
I can't stop feelin' high
I'll never come down

[Verse One] [Natti]
Too much pot in the brownie pan 
Got me baked faster than the brownies, man 
Have you ever been high from the inside out? 
On the lawn in my boxers like the insides out 
Carjack a Care Bear and just ride out 
In one of them cloud whips with the OnStar chip 
I'm so high, I hope you understand this shit 
Jane was plain til' I ate her then she came too quick 
Drink water while I'm rhyming but I still can't spit 
My mouth is pure cotton like a t-shirt coughin' 
If baked means potato then my brain is au gratin
Talkin to myself with my neighbors all watchin'
But going in the house proves way too hard 
When I fall in the front door and land in the back yard 
Physics don't apply, midgets in the sky 
Skippin' round my head saying Negro you so high! 
Damn

[Chorus] [x2]
I can't stop feelin' high
I'll never come down

[Verse Two] [Deacon]
Said I'm eye to eye with sky Gods beside Horus 
Feeling like that white man singing in the chorus 
How'd I grow to be the tallest tree in the forest 
Without putting green in a shell like a tortoise, huh? 
Rigor mortised, higher than a lions chin 
If this was symphonies I'm way up there with violins 
If its a choir then, soprano octaves 
In an opera, where God lives 
Look, I know I'm soundin' like a liar but 
These brownies are angel sex
Got a nigga high as fuck 
I smoke trees ins through all four seasons 
But I'm like gas prices, high for no reason 
Call a nurse your boys higher than Google Earth 
And if I fell the impact would put me through the dirt 
So let me zoom in, and get my zoom on
This weed is Neil Armstrong I'm on the moon blown

[Chorus] [x2]
I can't stop feelin' high
I'll never come down

I just wanted me, some regular weed
With regular stems and regular seeds
Cause this shit here...
I just wanted me, some regular weed
With regular stems and regular seeds
Cause this shit here...</pre>
