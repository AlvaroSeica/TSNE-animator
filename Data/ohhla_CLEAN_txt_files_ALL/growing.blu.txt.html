[Intro: Blue Raspberry]
This is Blue Raspberry...
This CD is called Ill Wind... Ill Wind...
Speaks for itself, it's ill...
And it was a windy, it was a windy road for me growing up
I was like crazy... growing up
Wilding out at a young age, going to clubs at the age of 14
Never got carded... and when I got grown they started asking me for my ID
I almost seen death three times
I got my seeds, which is the most important thing in the world to me
I'mma talk about what happened
From the beginning of my singing career, the mourn
The love, the start, thunderstorms, snowstorms

[Blue Raspberry]
It's been kind of hard... on this road to where I am
I remember back then... I never gave a damn...
About nothing in life... I just did what I wanted
Rebelled against my parents, and now look where it lead...
It's so hard, so hard... growing up...
And go through ups and downs...
Sometimes you feel like crying... I still cry, love...
But it's all about... growing up...
I know it really gets hard, especially when your a child
Growing up in this world, now...
And yours has been in a wrap sometimes..
But we love from our mistakes
It's all about... growing up...
Growing up... now I'm grown up...</pre>
