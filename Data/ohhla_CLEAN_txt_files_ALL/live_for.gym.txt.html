[Intro/Chorus: Daryl Hall]
I see a window and all I can think about is
do you wanna fly with me? Do you wanna fly with me?
I know it sounds crazy but I can't find solid ground so
So do you wanna fly with me? Do you wanna fly with me?

[Travie McCoy]
And I've been starin at this window for the past eleven hours
Thinkin about all the opportunities this window has to offer
From the 23rd floor to the filing cabinet East Manhattan to
FDR is beautiful as I'm watchin all the cars passin
An a couple stars twinkle so I started laughin
And a couple walked by an they looked so happy
I booked this room at this place called The Last Resort
where all my bags are packed, I got my jacket an my passport
and a first class ticket to the afterlife, you dig me?
Now is you is or is you ain't with me?
And I fully understand if you got other plans
But I can't see you hand in hand with another man
I been on auto-pilot, since we last spoke
And I don't want to board this flight on a bad note
I want you think about it, but either way I'm goin
And if you really love me, then here's the chance to show it

[Chorus]

[Daryl Hall: 2X]
Oh oh - we'll live forever
Maybe we'll write a novel about our love (do you wanna fly with me?)

[Travie McCoy]
She looked me dead in the eyes and took me by the hand
Kissed me on the cheek and said, "Baby listen I understand
You don't have to leave, plus I'm scared of heights
So just put down your luggage, forget about this flight
You and I, you know we been through a lot of things
But it's no reason to start trippin and arguing"
She said "You are my king, I place no one above you
And I don't have to board a plane for me to show I love you
And all this talk about the afterlife is kinda creepy
So let's just go lay down and talk I'm gettin kinda sleepy"
I kinda smiled and we both walked to the window
I pulled it shut and started starin at the sky
I wiped a couple tears away then we looked at each other
And I could see the stars twinkle in her eyes
I told her about the couple that I saw earlier
She said "I'm sure they were cute, but they're no you and I"

[Chorus]

[Daryl Hall: 2X]
Oh oh - we'll live forever
Maybe we'll write a novel about our love (do you wanna fly with me?)

So do you wanna fly with me? {*6X*}
