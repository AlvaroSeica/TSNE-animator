[Intro/Interlude]
I'm, ready, to, roll
I'm I'm, ready, to, roll
I'm, ready, to, roll
I'm I'm, ready, to

[Verse 1]
Step into the galaxy, ice ages they're passin me
Now the world is ours lookin at the beach from a balcony
And the word is bonded with solid gold from the alchemy
What he imagines becomes reality
Spent a lifetime with a masterpiece, kill 'em all savagely
Rappers ain't the truth talkin fallacy
Put it next to 'em if they spit now they swallowing battery acid
Ask who got the juice now candidly
Maybe it's a fantasy to lead in the following
The king of the dynasty, a queen in a hive of bees
Investin in the future, startin up a family
Makin it the new shit I'll even give you time to think, follow me
The swag ain't televised still I'm hoe channelling
Flyer than a comet, don't kill yourself, it's the Prada week
If the sky's the limit we got a endless supply of dreams
We could kick it first we gotta leave - obviously

[Chorus]
Wheels are turnin, the engine is workin, I'm ready to roll
I got my bag and my chick, lookin bad in the whip, I'm ready to roll
You know the sky is the road, when I'm in control, I'm ready to roll
I got a spliff for the ride, I be feelin the vibes, I'm ready to roll

[Yak Ballz]
You ready to roll huh? This here space is off-limits
Unless you bought a muh'fuckin ticket
In attempt to take the plunge maybe like Scrooge McDuck
Fixated on the plastic girls, fake world that drown in the
sea of skulls when you thought it was auspicious
The wrong thinkin that get you shark tankin with the fishes
Waterfallin this liquor down my throat
But tomorrow I'll be begging for forgiveness from the Pope
The new breed is more vicious, the teeth like spokes
Flippin styles like baseball cards between those
And I don't think the jury is authentic
Much as they insecure, trippin on some stepped on blow
Sup~?! You can't stand the heat then get the fuck up out the kitchen
That would be the gasoline I used to fire up the engine
High as the religion be in love was sort of sacrilegious
Smack her ass, this time it's for the distance, she ready to go

[Interlude] - 1.5X

[Chorus]

[Outro]
You ready to roll?
Yeah
That Yak Ballz shit, uh-huh
Gas Galaxy, yup
I'm ready to go</pre>
