Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Our Father who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done
On earth as it is in heaven

I can, I can call on you
I know that youll hear me
I can , I can call on you
I know that youll answer

You didnt know what to do
Came home from after school
Mom and dad said they were through
Now pretty soon was gonna have ta move
Shut the door went inside his room
Layed on the floor and he cried to you
Said jesus please help me through
Right now I just feel so confused
Dont know what I'm suposed to do
But I need to be close to you
Help me with what I'm goin through
Cuz I know that your here when I'm callin you
Everythings just fallin through
But aint nuttin too hard for you
So plesae come when I call to you
Cuz all that I have is all in you
And thats why

I can, I can call on you
I know that youll hear me
I can, I can call on you
I know that youll answer
I can, I can call on you
I know that youll hear me
I can, I can call on you (I can call on you)
I know that youll answer

She didnt knwo what to say
She got the phone call and it was late
It was a hit and run jus on the free way
And her son got hurt and was in bad shape
Tears ran down her face
As her mind began to race
Didnt knwo what to do what move to make
So she called up to you and began to pray
Jesus she began to say I need you in a major way
My son might die today I'm so confused please provide a way
Please now just give me strength
Please just help me face everything thats about to come my way
In you I trust and put my faith thats why (thats why)

I can, I can call on you
I knwo that you hear me
I can, I can call on you
I know that you answer (I know that youll answer)
I can I can call on you (I can call on you)
I know that you hear me
I can I can call on you
I know that you answer (I know that you answer)

So whati wanna say tonight
N e thing you face in life
When yoru mind is filled with strife
You can always find strength in christ
Even times when the money is tight
Even times when nothin is right
Dont worry bout nothin in life call him and thats my advice
And thats why thats why thats why (thats why)

[praying]
