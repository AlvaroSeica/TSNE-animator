[Intro: Dom Pachino]
It's hard work...
It's hard to make music that's good, man
Yeah, Dom P, yeah, Napalm
We doing big things, we doing big things over here
As a matter of fact, yo

[Dom Pachino]
Yo, I let it do what it do, regardless of him or you
Stay true to myself, I'm my own man
Got my own grand, divise my own plan
And I'm making tracks so hot, I'm sure they gon' stand
A Wise man once told me, just stick to your guns, and claim your own glory
Yeah, now let me tell you that's highly recommended
Watch out for snakes and the ones you befriended
Because they might stick it in you
You won't know until it hits you, laid up at the hospital
Now that's not recommended
Keep your third eye open, that's the message that I'm sending
That's the arm that I'm lending
I came from Killarm', Napalm's now the engine
Do me a favor, start it up...

*instrumental break*

[Dom Pachino]
Yeah, P got tracks for days
You gotta leave to come back, well I'm back to stay
They keep asking me, what's up with Killarmy?
That's a part of me, the reason why I spit darts
So retardedly, my understanding is an art to me
So I gotta paint my picture, unregardlessly
Whether group or solo, rocking Wu-Wear or Polo
Dom P'll do this shit, dolo
And you can picture that like a photo
And for all them niggas that be playing both sides like a homo
You gon' get called to the studio, and be a no show
You fucking with a real pro, Napalm general
Act like you know
And if you don't, I'mma put you up on some shit
Stuff your ass in the trunk, dump your body in the ditch, bitch</pre>
