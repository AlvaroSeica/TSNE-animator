Magic talking:

Look at the rear end on that thing now
What that is a Rolls Royce?
Na, that's a Mercedes
look, come here and lemme holla at you Mercedes
look look for real
I'm not looking for a girlfriend 
I need a partner

Chorus: (Magic)

You be my Bonnie and I'll be your Clyde
We can ride, side by side and watch the haters die
Baby we meant, I can tell you by that gangstashit you gangsta bitch
I start to thing that you were heaven sent
It's me and you
You be my Bonnie and I'll be your Clyde
We can ride, side by side and watch the haters die
Baby we meant, I can tell you by that gangsta shit you gangsta bitch
I start to thing that you were heaven sent
It's me and you

Verse 1: (Magic)

From the first day we met I could see the ghetto in your blood
But you ain't lookin' for love, you just lookin' for a thug
Let me explain my situ-o, see I ain't never had a job
But I keep some chips though, like I'm connected with the mob
So is you bout bein' Bonnie, can you handle the position?
Jump off bustin' at niggas in the heat of the mission
It's me and you against this fuckin' world till death do us part
You're the only bitch I'd kill for girl, 
Outlive a few niggas just to get to you
Live a few chickens just to get some loot
Everything you drive and address be brand new
Get out of line and I might beat you like a nigga
I'm the one that you respect, I'm the reason you countin' figures
Hate my enemies for hatin' me, tell em all
They ain't never crossed a thug like me
Mercedes can I trust you with my life?
When things ain't goin' right, when we argue, fuss and fight
Will you still be by my side?, when I'm smokin' gettin' high
Or when you be gettin' high, am I fucking you tonight?
Come on it's me and you

Chorus: (Magic)

You be my Bonnie and I'll be your Clyde
We can ride, side by side and watch the haters die
Baby we meant, I can tell you by that gangstashit you gangsta bitch
I start to thing that you were heaven sent
It's me and you
You be my Bonnie and I'll be your Clyde
We can ride, side by side and watch the haters die
Baby we meant, I can tell you by that gangsta shit you gangsta bitch
I start to thing that you were heaven sent
It's me and you

Verse 2: (Mercedes)

I'm your Bonnie, you're my Clyde
Together we will ride, and do a homocide
And if I have to prove my love to you
There ain't no limit so you know it's true
My momma always said that you were wrong for me
But little did she know you kept it real with me
Even steal for me, you knew the deal with me
And even if you had to, I know you'd kill for me
You know I'd die for you, I'd cry for you, I'd lie for you
And at the trial took 25 for you, A sacrfice for you
And I'll I really wanted was to be your wife boo
So just remember, I'm by your side
 
Chorus: (Magic)

You be my Bonnie and I'll be your Clyde
We can ride, side by side and watch the haters die
Baby we meant, I can tell you by that gangstashit you gangsta bitch
I start to thing that you were heaven sent
It's me and you
You be my Bonnie and I'll be your Clyde
We can ride, side by side and watch the haters die
Baby we meant, I can tell you by that gangsta shit you gangsta bitch
I start to thing that you were heaven sent
It's me and you

Magic talking:

look look look
I think this might be the beginning of a beautiful friendship
Ya know what I'm sayin?
I could see you bout it
And that's just what I been waitin' on
A down ass bitch 
Somebody gonna watch a nigga when he in a jam
Start bussin' at them motherfucking haters when they hatin' on me
Ya know what I'm sayin?
Watch a nigga's paper like I watch yours
And this shit could last forever
Let me tell you something
Every nigga need a down ass bitch on his side
You fell what I'm sayin?
And if you don't have that
Then you really don't have nothing
And I'm tryin' to make you that person
So is you bout it Mercedes?
Is you bout it?</pre>
