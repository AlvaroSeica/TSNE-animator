[ VERSE 1: Eightball ]
As the autumn leaves fell in the month of October
I found myself chiefin hay and every day never sober
Got Hen drippin down my chin and smoke in my lungs
Pullin hellafied hoes with my devilish tongue
Silk tailor made, I don't need yo name on my back
Got these bitches' mind addicted to this shit like it was crack
I went from good to bad, bad to worse to evil
Never thought I'd see myself not trustin my own people
Right up under my nose in the form of niggas and hoes
I'm playin by the rules cause that's all I ever been told
An eye for an eye, do unto others as they do you
Turn the other cheek and watch how many motherfuckers do you
Deceivin, got a nigga believin while they thievin
Tryina break even, a nigga damn near stopped breathin
Scared for my son's life, mine is already at the end
Tryina make a change so they don't have to go where I done been
A thin line between sin and what's right
Open my heart to God and hope that I get touched right
I just might take a life, stop breath, bring death
To all in my vicinity until there is just he left

[ CHORUS: Eightball ]
I been searching all this time
Tryina my best to find my way
Runnin round tryina chase this money
Takin me around the world in a day
Blowin smoke all up my nose
Gettin in and out my clothes
Foolin round with midnight hoes
Man, that's just the way life goes

[ VERSE 2: Eightball ]
It's hard to run, tabacco from them blunts got me winded
Sanity has ended, I'm not where I pretended
To be, a millennium away from reality
As far as the eye can see, there is no one but me
Ruins from a past life, as far back as last night
Burn like witchcraft, givin my path plenty light
I close my eyes, I cannot believe what I'm seein
Evil demons posin like they human beings
Invade my trip, them bitches came equipped
With banana peels, tryina make a pimp nigga slip
Some have no lips, some have no eyes
And it's strange how that never stopped the lies or the spies
From clutterin, damn near smotherin, always hoverin above me
Masked face, actin like they love me
Always wanna judge me, player, that ain't for you to do
Cause one day higher powers got somethin for me and you

[ CHORUS: Eightball ]

[ VERSE 3: Eightball ]
I close my eyes and try to imagine I'm somewhere else
Other than this hell we call Earth, from birth to death
Settin my mind free chemically helps me some
Oz.'s of trees enter me until my spirit is numb
Oral inhalation, halucinogenic sedation
Illegal medication force me into hibernation
Now my thoughts seem as vivid as a rainbow
I'm visited by an angel who came to make my pain go
On the outside it's all peaches and cream
In my mind I hear screams from horrible dreams
Flashbacks of some shit I wish I could forget
On the verge of havin a fit, not afraid to admit
I'm lost, and I don't know which way to go
I don't know who I can call that can save me, so
I'm gonna drop to my knees and ask to be forgiven
And pray for another way for me to be livin
Man, I'm lost and I don't know which way to go
I don't know who I can call that can save me, so
I'm gonna drop to my knees and ask to be forgiven
And pray for another way for me to be livin
