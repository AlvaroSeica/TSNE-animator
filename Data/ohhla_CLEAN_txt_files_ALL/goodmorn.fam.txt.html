Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus: Lounge Lo]
We rolling dice in the early morning, niggas getting money
Cops coming, put the blunts out, ain't nothing funny
Some niggas jet, some niggas stay, some niggas get locked
And some niggas walk away
Yo, it's O.T.F., baby, hit us with your best shot
Who we be? Who we be? O.T.F.
Yo, it's O.T.F., baby, hit us with your best shot

[Shawn Wigs]
Son, I smoke in the cut, skama broke up in the Dutch
That's why I never talk too much
Actions speak, techniques spin, Wu with the legion
Learn from the teaching, I'mma build with the speaking
Gat never leaking, ratchet up, mash it up
Space in the diamonds, I'mma patch it up
Bumper to bumper, Shortre 1.4.0. with the thunder
And fiend for the beat productions, take me under
Shake it up, shake it up

[Crunch Lo]
I got sucked back into the streets for sacrifice
My game stay fresh like dope on rice
Up in the freezer, fell in love with big heaters
Splash 'em with a gem or use my dick beaters
One to ten, God-God, where the lives is hard
Where the niggas die now and it don't seem odd
So sad, niggas broke they acts, and swallowed loose cracks
And the drugs react, it's like that
Up in the ghetto, still got nuts that I ain't let go
So niggas know ahead of they time, that they wet though
Spread metal like Olympics, flows invented
Hardcore shit, it's the O.T.F. vintage
Music for the hyper, active ass lifer
Thugged out niggas in cells who don't tell
From the elevator staff to the staircase cast
To the bitches with the big ass and jewels like niggas

[Chorus]

[Molly-Q]
The Grinch in the ghetto, Molly-Q Warbucks
Stick banana clips in your top lip and shut up
The streets is like clash of titans, gun fighting
Thrill of me and beating you, is in my writing
I copied the next thought, extort every airport
Running with, three of my genes and fought every law
And beat it, I'm undefeated, most wanted
Last seen with Lounge and smoking out marijuana
Four darters, one family, one Donna
Pillage O.T.F., everybody's godfather

[Lounge Lo]
We never fucking with the sucker ass, I play this rap life
Like alcohol tabs, fuck around, I'm in yo ass
Fucking with my top dollar, scholars are born
Collars are torn, and being burnt forth with gun powder
Hour wages, baby blue, powdered pagers
I been hitting stages through the dark ages, maximum high
I leave you slumped in the back of your ride
Laugh at ya guy, and watch you die from out the park blazer
Killah Hill, you heard Inspect' up on that R.E.C. shit
Lounge in the barracks, on some next shit
Watch me fast, come and go, run with no dough
You rather chill, rather be killed or Lounge with Lo
Cuz it's the high pro' globe nigga, rob the dough nigga
I take ice and make it look nice on low nigga
O.T.F., yo it's all in me, I got the call in me
Tell ooh, to tell, I said it's all in me
No doubt, I got skills to ball with me
Park Hill Projects, the dirty halls in me

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
