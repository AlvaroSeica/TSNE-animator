[Intro/Chorus: Ernie C]
Laaast dayyyys!
The laaast dayyyyys!!

[Verse One: Ice-T]
As I stare off the stage and try to understand why you feel
That I am someone you cannot deal with, how?
When you and I come from two totally polar opposite lifestyles
Under normal circumstances;
I'd be waking you and your rich parents up at gunpoint
Demanding the combination to the wall safe
While your little sister screams suffering from pistol-whipped pain
Or looking back at you in a courtroom filled with absolutely none of my peers
Why are you here? Is this some voyeuristic bullshit?
See black man sing? Or maybe, just maybe
You've been subjected to so many audio drive-bys and gang shootings
That you yourself have become numb to the pain like me
And you, check this out; have become insane from overdoses of reality
Well stomach this; at the rate we're going right now white boy
Yeah you, you and I will die holding each other's throats
That's real, the world's at war, we're at war
Check yourself, don't be me check your goddamn self
It's going down, 1997, see the light
Red lasers rip through my neighborhood at night, time is short
Homicide is the number one sport

[Chorus: Ernie C]
Laaast dayyyys!
Laaast dayyyyys!!
Some last dayyyyys!!

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
So now that all the reality's soaked and..
You start to re-analyze every word I ever said, am I a racist?
Or am I just someone who tells it how the fuck it is?
Well the truth of the thing is I was raised on crime
Walking through an environment so filled with so much hate
Honestly, I do not feel that you are able to comprehend the magnitude of the evil
But trip this; there were no white faces there, just black on black genocide
The only white men there were the cops that showed up late in the fourth
To outline the teenaged bodies in chalk
So who do I hate? - do I hate you? - do I hate myself?
Or possibly am I intelligent enough to only hold the conditions
of the ghetto itself to blame? Not! who creates the conditions?
Who stops affirmative action and welfare?
Who loves the 3 strikes law?
Didn't see them at the Million Man March
Or the Three Hundred and Fifty-thousand Man March, let your daddy tell it
There's a lot of lies out there, what side you on?
Armageddon is near, I am the fourth rider of the apocalypse
Recognize game!!

[Chorus: Ernie C]
Laaast dayyyys!
Some last dayyyyys!!
Laaast dayyyys!
We're in the last dayyyyys!!
Laaast dayyyys!
These are the last dayyyyys!!
Laaast dayyyys!

[Break: Ice-T]
But maybe I'm all wrong, maybe everything is okay
Maybe we're all just gonna get along
Maybe I'm tripping, maybe life is perfect, yeah right

[Chorus: Ernie C until faded]

[Outro: Ice-T overlapping the above chorus]
I hate you, you hate me, and what does that equal?
It equals nothing, and that's exactly what we're gonna have
Nothing, we don't make a change soon, and who am I to tell you anything?
I ain't nobody but a brother from South Central
Whose had the opportunity to go around the world
And I found out that we're all not really that different
Racism is the number one enemy of earth
There's only one race, the human race, and if we don't get it together soon
Then this song is true, we are all living in the last days!!</pre>
