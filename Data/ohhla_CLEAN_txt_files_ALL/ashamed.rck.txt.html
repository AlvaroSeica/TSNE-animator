[Intro]
Welcome to the home of the brave {Maybach Music}
ROZAY~!! Ugh
So +Self Made+
I can still count a mill' without a money machine nigga

[Rick Ross]
Got on my darkest shades, this man is made
Inherit no riches, Jehovah's my witness
Physical fitness, home economics
In the kitchen digital scales producin the product
Cut the noose off my neck, black runaway slave
In the coupe with the Tec, it's the home of the brave
They wanna know names, they totin them thangs
Never wanted the fame, just wanted the Range
I needed some change, momma needed a raise
She stayed in a rage, hated minimum wage
I'm feelin the same, all these criminals paid
Wearin Ballys and gold, I'm sellin dope shameless to say
And maybe one day I could put this pain away
Until then I'ma be a D-boy I'm ashamed to say
I'm ashamed to say
Until then I'ma be a D-boy I'm ashamed to say

[Chorus; repeat 2X]
"Honey, it's shameless"
"Shameless, what you've done"
Until then I'ma be a D-boy I'm ashamed to say
Until then I'ma be a D-boy I'm ashamed to say

[Rick Ross]
Before I was a fetus, had the genes of a leader
I mean look at my features, educated my teachers
I was callin them plays, you were still in the bleachers
Booby gave me the game, change to give me some sneakers
Now I'm roamin the block, car missin the top
Meanin missin the roof, hope you listenin y'all
I was dealt a few blows, I felt a few lows
Even shed a few tears, I travelled that road
Went from walkin on gravel, now I'm ridin on Vogues
Fifty M's in the bank, I get me two hundred I'm gone
Still so close to the hood, I'm ashamed to say
All the money in the world can't take this pain away
It's just another story at the campfire
Or courtside seats with the franchise
I think about my niggaz doin twenty-five
Shining bright, who am I for you to criticize?

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
I'm smokin psychedelics, I hustle like a felon
Hottest record label, but still and all I'm chillin
Not a crack in my voice, this young nigga so poised
First I stack me some money then go to war with them boys
Anybody can get it, hand his Manny some tissues
Better ring the alarm cause we bringin them pistols
Heaven singing them songs, speakin on sensitive issues
These emotional niggaz, and most of them killers
They movin in silence, but they follow your Twitters
These the games that they play they study your Instagram pictures
See I live by the code, that the mafia wrote
When he ran his mouth, me I'd rather the smoke
I'd rather listen, he had to ask permission
I had to make a way, I had to add commission
Until this day I'm slang, the commission remains
Now I'm worth over a billion, I'm ashamed to say

[Chorus]
