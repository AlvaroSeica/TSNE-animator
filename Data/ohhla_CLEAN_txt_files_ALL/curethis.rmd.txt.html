[Intro: Sweetleaf]
Oh, give it to me
Oh, give it to me (I've got to have it)

[Chorus: Sweetleaf]
If there's a cure for this, baby I want it, want it
If there's a remedy, baby I need it, got to have it

[Remedy]
This is a story brought before me, from the wise and the old
Take it down from the past, before ya eyes to unfold
Now I took this, crafted it and made it the mold
For all those rainy nights, left out in the cold
Yeah, the rat race, movin' at a nine-to-five pace
A life story based on paper chase
What's goin' on? Something's wrong in the world that we live
But if we hold on long enough it gotta give
How many times must history repeat in itself
Face defeat, mankind, be beat by himself
Generations done passed son, look at the last one
There's no more legends in the making, ask one
Man, money, then power, sex, rock and drugs
Economics, politics and thugs
I said, man, money and power, sex, rap and drugs
Anxiety, society fucks

[Sweetleaf]
I've got it have it...

[Chorus 2X]

[Remedy]
Unspoken words only heard from behind the closed door
Politicians hide themselves away, but started the war
Watch the day go out in fight, they leave that up to the poor (Give it to me)
And if you got another minute, I can tell you some more
Aiyo, never judge a book by it's cover, never cheat on ya lover
Never rob, never steal, love thy brother (Give me a remedy)
Never count ya money, always count ya blessings (Yeah-yay)
Never say never, always learn ya lessons
In the land once filled wit mad milk and honey (Uh-huh, give it to me)
What a man wouldn't do just for the taste of money (Yay)
What a woman wouldn't do for the touch of a man (Giev it to me)
It's those feelings deep inside of you, you don't understand
Lookin' for ya self, but you lost from within
Forever blinded by the night, like Hollywood glimpse
Yo, you tempted by the lust, that's the ultimate sin
Pealin' back, crawlin' outta ya skin, let me in

[Sweetleaf]
I've got to have it...

[Chorus 2X]

[Sweetleaf]
If there's a cure for this...

[Remedy]
Let me inject you, Rx, stress, Remedy, relief elixir

[Sweetleaf]
If there's a remedy... give it to me

[Remedy]
Let me infect you, certified cause
And effect ya mixer

[Outro: Sweetleaf]
If there's a cure for this... give it to me
Just give a Remedy, if there's a Remedy, yeah
I've got to have it
If there's a cure for this, baby I want it
Just give me a Remedy
If there's a Remedy, baby I need it
For this... come on now, and give it to me
I need it, hey hey, oh, give it to me</pre>
