(Daddy Free) (Gizmo)
Wakin up in the morning, ain't no delayin
feet ain't even hit the ground and I'm prayin
Lord I thank You for Your everyday Love and Affection
thank You for Your angels and Your hedge of protection
good morning Holy Spirit (ahhh) sweet coffee up (?)
that guides me in the righteousness, lead me won't You sir (?)
And could You send a lost soul my way
give me the right words to say and manifest in me today
In Jesus' Name I gives it plain and simple
I feel high, but ain't no dank or drink in my temple
thoughts of tearin up the devil like an insane tomcat
soldier mentality, got my mind on combat
give the rival no place, survivals the case
so I grab a gang a tracks, tucks the Bible in the waist
make haste for the door, and I'm on my way
to be a Soldier for Christ, that's only right, its all in a day

As a Christian its all in a day's work
time to kick dust plus the Saints are interceeding at the Church
It's all in a day
fall in and pray as we haul in the tray
I'm a soldier like I told ya, its all in a day   its all in a day
It's all in a day

mobbin down the street knowin I'm free, feelin lovely
brothers see me comin hummin "yes Jesus loves me"
Soldier of the Lord, hand on my sword
Cause pickin up my cross kicking hectic (?)
expecting out of the blue, it was two, and its a confirmation
barely took fo' steps and its a confrontation
brothers starin, and they swearin, but I ain't carin
preparin for warfarin, check it
he said "whats up" and I said "Jesus"
he said "yeah right" I said "believe this"
he received this from the start
before I came God prepared his heart
the fallow ground was broke and the yoke that choked
his neck was released, then all of a sudden peace
reignin the domain as we stand holding hands as we prayed and parlayed
I'm on my way, its all in a day
[repeat x2]  as a Christian its all in a day's work
time to kick dust plus Saints are interceeding at the Church
fall in and pray as we haul in the tray
I'm a soldier like I told ya, its all in a day
It's all in a day, yeah
day in a haul in a day as I speak (?)
creep to my peep let the weak say "im strong"
And its on let poor say "im rich" and the tables are switched
the scenario is the crucifix
death, burial, but most importantly to CMCs
is the Ressurection, uprisin, suprizin
ascended when he aprehended the keys
for the Gentiles, Jews, and the Gs
receive it by faith and believe it by faith and
And if you don't believe then youre deceived by Satan
so now I walk by the Just shall live by
all within i, till you read Romans 4:fizzive' (?)
And now by faith I make haste to preach the Gospel
Cause without faith, to please God is impossible
look in the mirror, seein clearer, his Return draws nearer
what I recite, the Seeds of Life to the hearer
reconciliatin men to God
been a Christian on a mission that's a full time job, yeah
I see some thirsty souls in my sight
uh, its time to bring the words of life
It's all in a day
(its all in a day)
As a Christian its all in a day's work
time to kick dust plus the Saints are interceeding at the Church

It's all in a day)
fall in and pray as we haul in the tray
I'm a soldier like I told ya, its all in a day
(its all in a day)
As a Christian its all in a day's work
time to kick dust plus the Saints are interceeding at the Church

(its all in a day)
fall in and pray as we haul in the tray
I'm a soldier like I told ya, its all in a day
(its all in a day)
As a Christian, its all in a day's work
time to kick dust plus, theyre prayin at the Church

(its all in a day)
fall in to pray, haul in the tray
It's all in a day
It's all in a day x20</pre>
