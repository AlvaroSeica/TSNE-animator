When I look up at the blue moon
And listen to a love tune
I know that she'll be comin soon
When I look up at the blue moon
And listen to a love tune
I know that she'll be comin

I met a woman, she was a beauty
I know she needed a man, that was my duty
How did I know this? I just knew it
A man was a man, so a man stepped to it
A conversation, she was attracted
Whoever built that body, they really stacked it
I gotta pull it, I can't blow it
I'm a bit nervous but just can't show it
She may try to say that I'm a little too young
Sometimes older women could leave a man strung
I'm 21, she's over 30
If I don't pull her, it's gonna hurt me
My capabilities are so mature
I think she's on it, hmn, now I'm sure
Because I got the number, a real power move
I'm only half-way until I show and prove

Now that I called her, I know her better
I need a gameplan, so I can get her
She's on a high post, drives a sports car
Lives in a highrise, could be a movie star
No doubt about it, the woman's wealthy
Beautiful face, body so healthy
She does aerobics, I gotta see this
Touch your toes, ooh, you got the sweetest
Long hair, light skin, never have to make it up
38-24-38 - break it up
She likes driving and roller skating
Swimming, eating and moonlight dating
Her sign is pisces, a real freak
The same as mine, I can do it all week
She's a romantic who knows a lotta moves
Still only half-way until I show and prove

It's been three weeks and not a move made
I guess it wasn't meant for me to get paid
Now I'm invited to her house tonight
A little dinner, champagne, a candle light
Should I accept it or front busy?
She'll know I'm frontin, then think why is he?
She lives alone, so it's a date
6 on the nose, she'll be here at 8
Take the shower, brush my hair
Then I have to press my gear
Everything is ready - I forgot to put on underwear
I'm actin silly, she's just a lady
I hear a horn ( *honk* ) it's a Mercedes
She says hello to me, I feel real dumb
I gave a little kiss, she gave a fat tongue
We're on our way to her house, I'm in a state of shock
Put in a fat tape and let the bass rock

A nice dinner on the spaghetti tip
Pop the cork of the MoÃ«t we're gonna sip
Nothin but candle light and such a pretty face
She has a bearskin rug and a fireplace
Throw on a jazz tune and just mellow out
So this is what bein rich is all about
Light up the fireplace and I'm maxin
She went to slip into somethin more relaxin

Boy what a body, I've seen it all
I would stand up but I might fall
She puts out her hand, I smell her perfume
Now she is leading me into her bedroom
I'm like Marvin, I need healing
I don't believe it, she has a glass ceiling
I see a blue moon and love tunes humming
I got it, I got it - and guess who's coming

It's been a week now, I haven't seen her
I know I rocked it, I think I need her
I got her number, but should I call it?
Or should I just flush it down the toilet
So the result of this, I guess I am strung
Was I that dumb or just too young?
I'm actin silly, she was just a lady
I hear a horn ( *honk* ) yo, it's her Mercedes</pre>
