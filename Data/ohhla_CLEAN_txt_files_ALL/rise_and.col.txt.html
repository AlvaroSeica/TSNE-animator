[Intro - Jay-Z - talking]
There's a nigga right now somewhere (ah!)
He at the table, with a, with a bowl of Apple Jacks (*laughing*)
And he's readin the back of the cereal
And in between, in between eatin the Apple Jacks, he's writing some shit
And he, he want my spot
I'm a find him though, I'm a sign him (*chuckles*)
I don't want no problems (*laughing*)

[*Sample from "Arise, Shine" by Greg Dykes and The Synanon Choir
plays for 22 seconds and throughout*]

[Verse 1 - J. Cole]
Like we always do at this time, C-Cole blowin your mind
Hey dummy, this no accident, all of this was designed
T-T-Took my time, c-c-crept from behind
And I opened up your blinds, rise and shine
Cole World, same nigga used to drive around with yo' girl
In my mama's Civic, now I'm out here tryin to get it
I ain't like you lame ass niggaz, boy I spit it, how I live it
So when you see me in the streets, man I ain't got to mimic
'Cause I ain't got an image to uphold, this real shit
I ain't got a gimmick, I just flow, that niggaz went nuts for
The boy that set fire to the booth
In a game full of liars, it turns out that I'm the truth
Some say that rap's alive, it turns out that I'm the proof
'Cause the ones y'all thought would save the day, can't even tie my boots
The ones y'all thought could hang with me, can't even tie my noose
Let these words be my bullets nigga, I don't rhyme, I shoot (bang!)

[Chorus - J. Cole]
Before I wake (uh), I pray to the Lord (uh), my soul to take (uh)
My soul to take (uh), my soul to take (uh), my soul to take

[Verse 2 - J. Cole]
Lord I've been dreamin about the paper, get rich 'fore I see my life caper
Hope my mama get to see Jamaica 'fore she meet her maker
I hoop but never good enough to ever be a Laker
But these words I record got me ballin, Jordan
More than a rapper, this a natural disaster
Boy, I'm meaner than Katrina mixed with Gina - "shut up, Cole"
This is for my niggaz back home, homes - "what up, bo?"
This is for them bitches that played me - "what up, ho?"
Nah I ain't mad, it's sad, you went from bad to real bad
Two kids that don't even know they real dad
Real sad, baby girl, I wish you still had it
Then maybe you could get a taste of livin +Villematic+
It's Cole, still at it, y'all be talkin about the same shit
Man, how I feel about it? Mama was a real addict
That's why I don't respect that lyin ass, white shit you talkin
Cole plannin funerals, you might fit the coffin

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - J. Cole]
Hey, uh, get on your job little mayne, this ain't Saturday
We in two different lanes, you can't navigate
We in two different games, you playin "patty cake"
Brother you're lame, you're Shane Battier
Ya out of shape, my mind run a mile a minute
The sky's the limit, I'm so high, I'm divin in it
My rides is tinted, my knob's gettin slobbed up in it
She hollerin "God!", man you would've thought that God was in it
But it's just a nigga God invented
The best out, foolish pride'll make you not admit it
Well if this shit ain't fire nigga, why you noddin with it?
The hate in your blood can't stop your soul from vibin with it
Now you all conflicted, 'cause my flows is wicked
And my hoes is thicker and all of yours is pickin me
'Cause they, know a star when they see a star, nigga
Ain't even got to fuck him, to know he a raw nigga
I got her in my bedroom but cheer up, nigga
You saved so many hoes, you a hero, nigga (huh)
Medal of honor, I'm feelin on top like Pac, when he slept with Madonna
Hey, this is death before dishonor
Get arrested and forget to tell my mama
She got enough to stress about, my nigga gonna get me out
Then we hit the club with the thugs and the liquors
No criminal record but I'm makin criminal records
Isn't it ironic? Isn't it iconic?
Jacket so expensive, you wouldn't even try on it
But it fit me perfect, I purchase it, if I want it (uh)
The city on my shoulders, so no girl, you can't cry on it (uh)
When you make a list of the greatest, aye, am I on it? (uh)
Maybe not yet but bitch I got the clock set, it goes
Tick, tock, game on lock
Sun gon' shine but the reign won't stop, oh no

[Outro - J. Cole]
Hey
If I should die, before I wake (uh), I pray to the Lord (uh), my soul to take (uh)
My soul to take (uh), my soul to take (take ...)</pre>
