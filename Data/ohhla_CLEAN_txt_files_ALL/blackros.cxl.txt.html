[Chino XL]
Screamin at the top of my lungs 'til God notice me
Tryin to find my stairway to Heaven where I'm supposed to be (find me)
Still carryin weapons to get my children groceries (by any means)
It's one man against the world, Black Rosary

Only feelin hate in my heart, paintin poetry (revenge)
My prayers go ignored in the dark, it hurts emotionally (hurts)
Hopin that Lucifer's heart will finally let go of me (let go)
It's one man against the world, Black Rosary (hear me!)

Screamin at the top of my lungs 'til God notice me (find me!)
Tryin to find my stairway to Heaven where I'm supposed to be (save me!)
Still carryin weapons to get my children groceries (by any means)
It's one man against the world, Black Rosary (I'm lost!)

Only feelin hate in my heart, painting poison poetry (hear me!)
My prayers go ignored in the dark, it hurts emotionally (revenge)
Hopin that Lucifer's heart will finally let go of me (let me go!)
It's one man against the world, Black Rosary
