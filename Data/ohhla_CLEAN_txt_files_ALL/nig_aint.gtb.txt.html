[Scarface]
Shit's cold, colder than a fucking 'caine right here
Niggaz, fucking over their own partners and shit
Partners fucking over their own niggaz
That's cold
Bitches setting niggaz up and shit
Trying to get a nigga for hits
The worst shit about the whole motherfucking thing;
They're killing niggaz in Africa
Then started killing niggaz over here
Right on my motherfucking face, K-K-K ass shit
Niggaz ain't even doing shit
Niggaz ain't even doing shit
It's fucked up!</pre>
