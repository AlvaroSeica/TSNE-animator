Song:   Seen Enough
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro]
What? Uhh
Seen enough (seen enough) heard enough (uh-huh)
Seen enough (that's right) heard enough (uhh)
Keep, on, movin (you gotta keep on)
Don't, stop, groovin

[Sadat X]
My heart can only beat in the land of New York
With the blue N.Y., damn sure fly
Sadat X is like the monument
Came to the party sober, left the place a headcase
I be the star of the A-bars, 12 bars and titty bars
Hold your seed to the stars and explain what's up
I'm like Red from the Five Heartbeats, I strive
My office hours boy is from 9 to 5
I made my bones in the old Rooftop
But niggaz ain't aware cause there's cars parked there
AY~! Never been gold but retained my skills
Been around the world and unfurled the flag
I seen a 20 piece rise from a trey bag
Down with the {?} pickin D's and the MVP's
And my {?} Bronx family that come out when it's {?}
My peeps they hold me down, Now Rule gets the crown
(Now I)

[Chorus]
Seen enough (uh-huh) heard enough (I heard enough)
Seen enough (yeah) heard enough (so uhh)
Keep, on, movin (you gotta keep on)
Don't, stop, groovin (don't stop it don't stop)
Seen enough (huh) heard enough (yeah)
Seen enough (uh-huh) heard enough (you gotta)
Keep, on, movin (you gotta keep on)
Don't, stop, groovin

[Lord Jamar]
Lord Jamar, the best in Westchester
Ex-lab investor, grab your Winchester
Mic molester, watch me strike under pressure
On the turnpike during, thunderous weather
Alluring to the smell when we burns a L
Reassuring what we learned translates to sales
Your fanbase is frail, caught a case now you in jail
I'm workin on the large scale you workin on the God's bail
Like the Qu'ran or the Holy Grail
My New Testament is excellent
You've been afflicted with the pestilence
Got you addicted to the nonsense, with no contents
They say the best defense is a good offense
And in the present tense a lot of niggaz ride the fence
I'm fly with confidence (uh-huh)
In every continent we make dollars and cents
Stars of the Eastern Conference (I-I-I)

[Chorus]
Seen enough (uh-huh) heard enough (yeah)
Seen enough (seen enough) heard enough (hearrd enough)
Keep, on, movin (you gotta keep on)
Don't, stop, groovin (don't stop don't stop don't stop)
Seen enough (WHAT?) heard enough (uh-huh)
Seen enough (where we at) heard enough (right)
Keep, on, movin (you gotta keep on)
Don't, stop, groovin

[Grand Puba]
Now do the Knowledge have these Wisdoms understand the God's culture
Build Power standin frozen like they posin for Minolta
Bet you all will shine in your lifetime
Haji God'll make you sizzle, rhymes written in chisel
Lounge on the plush, keep my business on the hush
Keep it that way so nobody has to get touched
I know the biggest of the big and the smallest of the small
So ball, I'm caught up in the middle of it all
Don't worry, Grand Pub' on the situation
Move an imitation out like immigration
Cause God damn, I got somethin in the skillet
Heat up the flame, and watch me kill it
I like to stay bent like a pair of 20 inch shoes
Take a cruise and talk about nigga news
So you can get mean, sip your Cristine and then lean
Just recognize when God on the scene

[ad libs of Chorus for about 8 seconds]

[Outro: Grand Puba]
Power standin frozen like they posin for Minolta
What? Brand Nubian, Born God
There it is, right here and right now, make it hot huh?
Raise the roof one time to the top huh?
Don't stop huh?
Drop it off right there Brand Nubian, to 2000
Lord J... Dottie X
Hit them niggaz we call they bluff, huh, what?

Uhh, where we at, where we at?
Born God, uhh, born me, me
What you see, M-I-C, it's Brand Nubian
