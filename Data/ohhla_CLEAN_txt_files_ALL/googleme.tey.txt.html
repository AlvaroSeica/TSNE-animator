[Verse 1]
What's the word
I'm the word on the street
Ain't nobody hotter than me broads wish they was me (huh)
I'm superb
Fly like a bird
Sixteen with the baddest curves
Breezy's checkin on me
I'm hot hot
But I'm cooler than your jewels
I am a bigshot
Probably see me in the news
Explore like safari
You know where ya girl be
If you wanna find me
Baby you can google me

[Chorus]
You ain't even gotta ask nobody bout me
I'm certified on the internet read about it
If you looking for me
Go and pull it up
Cause I'm a celebrity
I know you done heard of me
You ain't even got a clue but it's so true
They flashing them cameras
Cause baby I'm the new, new
So if you looking for me go and pull it up
Cause I'm a celebrity
Go head &amp; google me

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I bet you find me in Webster
Under the word "star"
And I shine like the deuce 6's on the car (Bling!)
Can't get away from my pictures
Every where you are
Wanna see a living legend
You ain't gotta look far
Up close &amp; personal
Don't act like you don't know

Put it in ya search engine
"Teyana - The Princess of Harlem"
Baby you can google meeee!

[Chorus]
You ain't even gotta ask nobody bout me

[Bridge: Jazze Pha]
Ladies &amp; Gentle men! Teyana!
On the cover on a magazine
Hand wavin out the limousine
Interviews
And puttin it down in the booth
(So you can see me &amp; hear me)
Every day, all day I grind
So you can go head &amp; gimme my shine
Cause I'm a prodigy
You ain't gotta believe me
Google me baby!

[Chorus]
(You ain't nobody) Google me baby!
(Ya betta ask somebody) You betta google me baby! (Google Teyana!)
(You ain't nobody) Google me baby!
