[Intro: Heavy D] 
This one goes out to the Rough and Rugged motherfuckers out there
You know what I'm saying? "Yes, Baby"
Strictly on the Latifah tip, you know what I'm saying?
Rough like this!!

[Latifah] 
... nothing about this here, yo, this is queen Latifah in the house
I got my boy Heavy D, my boy Treach
And my boy KRS-One in the house to rip some shit with me right quick

[Verse One: Treach]
The quicker committee getting witty for bitty cause the war ain't one
Dis the city where I'm from, I'll glue your titties to your tongue
It's out, like the sweet, it's big big hit
The Black Bleep, the blip, smoking shit with mad misfits
The one man, one mold, Murder one, one murder gold
One hard headache to hold, word to god; it's good as Gold
If it ain't rough, it ain't ashy and Brick Thick
And if it ain't nasty, Naughty's pissing on your picnic
Rough is the place, the space, knuckle which way you think
Here to put a fat black nose on the Black Sphinx
I don't shoot to get pimples order your Christmas
I shot St. Nick, cause stuff for the kids I ain't get
No One under seventeen admitted, so I came eighteen deep
You can raid but you can't fade me queen Pee
if it ain't rough, it ain't rugged
And if you can't hear it, you can't dub it, or rough it

[Chorus: Treach &amp; "Latifah" X2]
If it ain't rough "I could do without it"
If it ain't rough "Just throw it to the curb"
If it ain't rough "He could do without it"
If it ain't rough "It's working my nerves"

[Verse Two: Heavy D]
Tell me how you like it? "Rough" 
Tell me how you need it? "Rough" 
Tell me how you keep it? "Rough" 
Tell me how you want it? "Rough"
It's going on... tuck away your entire stuff
I'm coming tough, rugged and rough, from a blunt, take puff 
Uhh.. never joke with a tech nine
Harder than a sex mob next time, flex when it's my time
I'll take a chump or a champ, a clamp or a zamp 
so now the rolly polly, holly molly, now I'm magnificent
Skip to my lewd, gather up your crew
Let the heavy setters show you what a nigga could really do 
Today, We all know about body bags
But seems everybody brags about being tough; catch a body tag
Knowing well, they just cream puffs 
Talking tough, cause they've stuff, it's a bluff
They ain't tough, they ain't nothing

[Chorus: Treach &amp; "Latifah" with minor Variations - X2]

[Verse Three: KRS One]
Check it out!! COME ON!!
Follow me now massive, follow me now massive! 
Follow me crew, follow me crew
KRS-One in the party just like Agwan wanna "Ease off!!"
Here we go, yo, you know the flow
I get low and high, you know
Why you wanna flow with the pro? 
Ohh.. No No No No No No No! 
Breaking rappers in half, by the ass is my only task
Gold and Platinum Plaques will pass, only talent will last
I come to the party prepared to kick ass!!
You come to the party well prepared then get scared
You're through and need stitching up, you and your crew start bitching up
Where you gonna live where I'm not stomping it? 
I really believe you're a wee bit over confident
On MTV, you wanna down rate me quick, yeah, I'm a hypocrite
When you're in my face, you're on my dick
Consequently your lyrics don't flip, don't get a grip
You're straight on that sucker shit

[Chorus: Treach &amp; "Latifah" with minor Variations - X2]

[Verse Four: Queen Latifah]
Here comes the queen
I'll make a woman on the track 
Get attracted like a fiend to the beat so I rap
You're looking for a friend to the end
Well, that's me, but if you're looking for a gangster bitch
That's exactly what you're gonna see
Ain't no way, ain't no say, this ain't your lucky day
So go pray, now you pay, cause I don't FUCKING play
Matter fact, I think Ice-T, he put it just right
"You dis me on record, you see me fight"
Just throw up the joint, and get to the point
And cut all the talk, the BS can walk
Cause I ain't out here to waste my breath
You test my skills, you're getting put to your death
Listen, I'm sick of all the huff, puff blow your house down bullshit
I heard last week, you get your ass beat
So Watch the way you approach the Queen
If it ain't rough; I'll send that ass to the guillotines

[Chorus: Treach &amp; "Latifah" with minor Variations - X2]

[Outro: KRS-One Overlapping the Chorus]
BOOYAKKAH!! BOOYAKKAH!! BOOYAKKAH!! BOOYAKKAH!!
Yo, Latifah is back in effect y'all
One Queen!! ~ that's right One Queen!!
First lady in the house
All other queens can get deadly overthrown
All hail to the queen!!</pre>
