[Intro: Li-Mouse]
Yeah, yo, been doing this for a long time
People always asking us, when our joint gon' come out
But, you know, shit is hard
Got work, school, all that
It's alright, though, we always come through at the end
Good things take a long time to make
You know, that's word, from my heart, yeah

[Cno Evil]
Six years ago, a friend of mine
Showed me his ways with his brand new rhyme
And that's the rhyme, that I'm about to say
He spit it for me, and it went this way
"I'm the M-O-U-S-E, featuring Cno E
I'm just so nice, that's why people sweat me
My rhymes is so cold, I need coffee in a foam cup, to warm up
You defeat me? It'll be all luck"
It went like that, I was like oh shit, we blowin' up real fast
No matter what we said to our friends, they would stil laugh
We said, fuck 'em, we doin' it big, we goin' public
Performin' out in the courtyard, during lunch and shit
Blessed with the name Rodentz, with the force of broncos
We would, spit over acoustic strings, by Dennis Polanco
At the, Songwriter's Showcase, be the only rappers to show they face
We'd have, middle aged folks, clappin' up the place
Spittin' outside, little theatres, and cafeterias
Our rhymes so sick, infest the food with bacteria
Invested with our flows, a little bit
We bought better microphones and, better equipment
Said fuck it, no more downloadble instrumentals
I started creatin' beats, of ideas from out my mental
Friends started to get hype, so they would try to cram in
But when all the dust cleared out, only me &amp; Mouse were standing
Years passed, more cameras documenting our flows
I still got the tape with Peter Freeman yellin' "Cno!"
During our, senior year, we were tired, so we fucked up
Decided to commercialize this time to try and blow up
"It's On" -- was the name of that song
It actually gained popularity amonst high school halls
Had freshmen bitches crowded up in a bed
While me and Mouse spit in wife beaters right off of our head
No more, off the paper, we felt just like heroes
J.C. Williams and Sam Turner, shot our first video
In the Prelude, we rhymed, in the laundry room we shined
We even had girls all up on us, this time
Our heads started to gas up, so we pushed it
Next show we had was filled with 'germs' and 'bullshit'
Straight up disaster, and that was well earned laughter
So high school ended right there, much faster
Heard questions, "Aiyo, when's the album really droppin'?"
Still felt support "Whens the CD out? I'm coppin'"
School's over, felt like our careers were over
Me and Mouse wouldn't talk that much, but we stayed sober
Couldn't speak for the rest of those, so-called-friends
Called us up, once in a blue moon, won't do that shit again
Mouse kept writing rhymes, my beats started to get beyond they time
I told Mouse, let's do it right this time
Cuz I felt like I took hip hop for assault and battery
Mouse started, to write rhymes faster than me
Went from Six Feet Under, Foretold Future, Order Rodentia
Spendin' My Day, Secret Manuals, not to mention the
Countless hours of recording demos like showers
Rainin' down on White Plains, stand like towers
Now we don't give a shit,  on who supports us anymore
Those who said they buy our shit, they can hit the door
And we don't wanna hear your shit, when you see us on TV
First you wouldn't speak to me, now we all friendly? Man...
From now on, this is our moment
Sincerely, Darren Mosley &amp; John Siino, better known to you as The Rodentz

[Outro: Li-Mouse (Cno Evil)]
Yeah, man, I told you, we ain't doing this shit for you, man
We doing it for us, been working on it for like, 4, 5, 6, years
I don't even -- I lost count already, man
If you don't like it, you don't got to listen to it, I don't care
Fuck it, you think we care, yo, you can say whatever you want, man
You're wack, I'm wack, Cno's wack, I don't care, shit
Man, yo, I'm telling you right now, most of that joint out there
They be saying the same shit anyway, yo, we're just
We're just trynna bring some variety into this, knowhatimean?
Something different, for once, you know
Like, you talk about, this guns and ammo
Yo, we talk about, this shit over here, this next shit
We talk about the knowledge, I'm saying, man
You hate it, you know, don't come out with another album
Saying, "Oh, we hate The Rodentz, we hate this"
"Order Rodentia's wack, whatever", yo, I don't care
I personally don't care, we're not gonna come back with any diss songs, back
Youknowwhatimsaying? We don't care, I'm saying, we doing this for us
We like it, fuck you
(People need to stop, they need to stop, fucking
Listening to the beats, need to start listening to the lyrics and
And, maybe they can learn something, knowhatimean?
You know, they can just fucking learn something from the words, man
Stop listening to the beats -- I mean, the beats is fucking slamming, you know that
I fucking worked 6 years to make beats like this, fucking training and shit
But at the same time, we writing lyrics, so you can fucking learn
Not some, fucking, Dr. Seuss, Mother Goose type shit, youknowhatimsaying)
Trynna tell you guys some shit... (Man, what the fuck, this ain't no fucking cartoon, man
This is real life, you know, we ain't gonna spit about guns and shit,
cuz that ain't our fucking life)
He never -- , I never -- I tell you the truth, I never held a gun in my life, man
(Fuck that shit, you know what, I might not be -- going to school or whatever
But I spit more knowledge on this CD then you'll learn in 4 years in high school, so what)
Word, word, you fucking, fake ass scholars out there (Word, man
Here's your diploma, bitch)</pre>
