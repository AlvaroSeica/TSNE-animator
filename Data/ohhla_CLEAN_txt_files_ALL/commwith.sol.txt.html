[Solomon Childs]
My baby down, And she don't run around town
My Queen and her diamond crown
And I told myself I'd never again let love drag me down, Or let me drown
Guess I was runnin with them old timers up North
Theory how you could keep your woman forever if you just go down town
But instead it just closed me down
But in order to stand tall you gotta be knocked down
An opportunity will never again catch me face down
But I thank the good Lord that you calmed me down
Clamped down on my heart, Before I shut down
Now I'm focusing, I'm spittin that melt down, That push a nigga around
But seriously, I like it when we watch the sun go down
Jewelry shoppin in China Town New York
When you come on air tram for weekends in New York

[Chorus: Solomon Childs]
Baby baby communicate with me
Baby baby communicate with me
Baby baby communicate with me
I used to tell her that's the only way we'll ever make it
Baby baby communicate with me
Baby baby communicate with me
Baby baby communicate with me
She used to tell her that's the only way we'll ever make it

[Solomon Childs]
Do the knowledge to this, Be real to the one that you love'n
Don't take em for granted, If when they want to go, You wanna panic
Treat em like you wanna keep em, Hold em like they mean the world
Act on your own heart ladies, Don't take advice from your girls
As well as the fellas, Don't take advice from your mans
Cause the advice be as good as stories, That in a gun fight a tech won't jam
But I aint trying to discourage the field, Or the modern day sex exam
But at the end of the day I'm speakin for me and my program and she beautiful
Like a tropical beach hologram, Or the knowledge of inherited millions by telegram
So now-a-days I just enjoy the glam, And I'll make em feel the best that I can
Cause she sowed up my heart and helped me love again

[Chorus]

[Outro: Solomon Childs]
Nahmean, I said hold your baby man, You know
Stay with your Boo, Nahmean, I'd like the thank you though
I'd like to thank you, Haha, Cause I'ma hold mine
I'm holdin mines, Holdin mines</pre>
