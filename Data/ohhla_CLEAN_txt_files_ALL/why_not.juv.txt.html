[Intro: Juvenile + Skip]
You can find me in the parking lot
By the car lot-where we spark a lot
Up in the hallway it be dark a lot
We don't talk to cops cause we all be hot

Homey you need to get you somethin new (why not)
Shit I'm ridin somethin green, somethin blue (why not)
They gon' respect it when a gangsta come through (why not)
They doin numbers, we'll do somethin too (why not)

[Juvenile]
Is you doin ya dirt, they really know ya bout ya work
if they scopin ya turf you goin out there head first
do you know the rules when you got beef with a fool
can you stick and move and do you sleep with the tool
you in the camp you bout to make you an examp
so when they see the stamp they gon'respect it like a champ
you light in the ass but kind of heavy with the cash
be rollin the grass you still totin the solider rag
you been out there on the grind spendin most of ya time
in a section full of nobody's so you gotta shine
will you bust a head, know how to do it-how to play it
bet a hundred in the field and parlay
can you flip a Z, go back and get a Quater ki
when you rid of that call Rico up and order three
put ya people in it cause that's the way you gotta see it
if you wanna be respected as the G'est

[Chorus: Juvenile + Skip]
Homey you need to get you somethin new (why not)
Shit I'm ridin somethin green, somethin blue (why not)
They gon' respect it when a gangsta come through (why not)
They doin numbers, we'll do somethin too (why not)

You can find me in the parking lot
By the car lot-where we spark a lot
Up in the hallway it be dark a lot
We don't talk to cops cause we all be hot

[Juvenile]
You like states with pretty hoes in ya face
you hate checks, you just come home on a case
can you make a name-will you be patient in the game
can you state ya claim, and reputation stay the same
will you hold it down when ya lil'homies ain't around
will you hold ya ground like you the only one in town
is you feelin this, you listen to it when you creep
you real in the streets all in the hood with the heat
you ain't tryna joke gotta be real for ya folks
is ya people broke they aggrivate you on the porch
do you sell weed and you don't never make a profit
do you blow big until it hurt you in ya pocket
you just scared to lose cause you a winner all the time
you gotta lot to prove lil'sinner on the grind
put ya people in it cause that's the way you gotta see it
if you wanna be respected as the G'est

[Chorus]

[Juvenile]
Do you G's up when it's a dime in ya grill
do you freeze up when it's that time for a kill
if they pop at you is you gon'pop back at 'em
you gon'stay away from niggaz if they rattin
wanna ride swoll pull up on 24 flats
can you get a hoe without you throwin her a stack
is you callin shots can you stay away from the cops
you know how to stop you be inside when it's hot
you from the East, you from the West, you from the South
you from the North, or the Midwest what you about
can you twist a gar without you fuckin up the road
did you get a car just to be stuntin for the hoes
you been out here and it's ya time for a lick
do you know this year as you aknowledgin the shit
put ya people in it cause that's the way you gotta see it
if you wanna be respected as the G'est

[Chorus]</pre>
