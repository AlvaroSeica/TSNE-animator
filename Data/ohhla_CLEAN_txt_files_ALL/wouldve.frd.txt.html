[Intro]
Yea yea
Rock town baby
Aha, yea
Chyeah

[Verse 1]
I got a lot of complaints, I got a lot on my plate
But shit I'm eating
I could've been wet up, or drowning in that deep end
Could've been working a job, hurting my pride
It could've been worst, but I've determined to thrive
I ain't educated in colleges, financial aid and no scholarship
I did all I could, even though I'm fatherless
I worked for it, so bleed and fore it don't bother us
I'm a masochist, I'm enjoying pain it's anonymous
I've seen a lot of shit go down in my younger days
People double over from hunger pains and I wasn't phased
I'm from a place where pedophiles fuck the underaged
When a child pregnant, they all runnin the other way
Could have been my sister, I would've caught a fucking case
Cause a body bag's the only way to put that scum away
But I'm a motivate my folks to put the drugs away
I ain't judging, I'm just showin there's another way

[Chorus]
Imagine what I could've been
6 feet where you would've been
Could've been lookin at the pen
But I just took it to the pen, when, when
Imagine what I could've been
But instead, I imagine what they couldn't get
Now every day I live a dream, every day a different scene
If everything is what it seems

[Verse 2]
Y'all see the way I rap, flow behind them bars
I could've been right behind them bars
Girls in Bahamas in pajamas all living
Could've been in back of hoofties, getting the car driven
Or ridin round looking for you
On the crib, with a key, your bitch cooking it too
Imagine that, use my father's gun
Bullets criss cross kill you with my daddy mack
I ain't have to rap tracks spittin pain
Could've kept serving fiends, seen the tracks in they veins
I'm from the grounds raised in hell anyway
Nothing to lose, they said I would fail anyway
I was empty, except for the first 3rd and the 15
For still the odds was against me
What do you do when you the oldest out of 6
Know if I wasn't flowing, I be lawing up that clitch
I was lucky to put the snob away
Happy God showed me that it was another way
I was lucky to put the snob away
Happy God showed me that it was another way

[Chorus]
Imagine what I could've been
6 feet where you would've been
Could've been lookin at the pen
But I just took it to the pen, when, when
Imagine what I could've been
But instead, I imagine what they couldn't get
Now every day I live a dream, every day a different scene
If everything is what it seems</pre>
