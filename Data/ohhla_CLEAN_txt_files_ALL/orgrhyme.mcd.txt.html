[ VERSE 1: MC Duke ]
Hey! I don't say it's right to fight
But I must incite a riot tonight
My plight is this: I was born on the black side
From my head right down to my backside
And my homeland is run by another
Gimme that back (Yo, word to the mother)
Land in my hand I have not felt
Cause my race still reels from the deals you dealt
Knelt and prayed to a god you made
Stolen from us in a different age
Bold as you are, livin like a star
While my mind still rocks from a mental scar
Nah, you don't wanna know how it feels
I'ma blow up your ship and rip the keel
Here's the big payback, line for line

[ VERSE 2: MC Duke ]
You better hope I don't find my scope
Cause you can't cope with thise here dope
Nope, don't even try it, but don't deny it
And don't make no rule, cause I'll defy it
Try it and I'ma let off, so call your bet off
You made me mad, so you know you better jet off
That's to show how mad I am
Gimme chance and I'll gladly slam
You and your homies to the ground
Inject a key and then I pound
A sound that I make but I don't fake
And yet my homeland you still take
Break, shake, rattle, made me roll
To my (brothers and sisters) (I know you got soul)
So I say check the time

[ VERSE 3: MC Duke ]
Let's talk about South Africa
You say the word, people laugh at ya
But nothin is funny, you're takin my money
And beatin the girl that I'm callin my honey
Sonny, I'ma get up and take a stance
Slap the Bible out your hand
Turn the other cheek? You stupid freak
I learned not to do that way past last week
Deepest concentration mode
Of course my conversation sold
But not sold out cause without a doubt
If you see my show I rock the house
But I can't rock the homeland
Cause that's controlled by the man
Damn I ain't havin it, not this time

[ VERSE 4: MC Duke ]
To rock the joint and make my point clear:
There ain't a race in the place that I fear
But I see other races are afraid of me
They call me a villain and Jamaican thief
Paranoid to the bone
And now old ladies are scared to leave home
Yeah, I used to do that, a stick-up kid
Of course - I learned from the things you did
But now I stand back and bust my rhyme
I did the crime and then the time
A model citizen, and I pay my taxes
While the government cools out, relaxes
On money, stolen years ago
I speak the truth and you fear the show
You want me to say, "Ooh, I'll play the game"
(Hell no) I refuse to act tame
Shame, cause I caught you sleepin
Big fat stomach while the kids are weepin
That's alright cause we'll get our time
