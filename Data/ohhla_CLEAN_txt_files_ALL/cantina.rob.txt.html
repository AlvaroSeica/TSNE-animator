What's up, ese
Nah
Last night was the bomb, homie
We got tore up, ey
But I woke up with this big hangover
Ha ha
Let me tell you
Little story about the cantina

(Verse 1)
I usually wait til Sunday, to have my menudo
But it's Saturday, and I woke up all crudo
I think I had one too many shots of tequila
Mira
I heard I made a toast to mi vida
Left a big tip, mariachis took my grip
And the sad thing about it is I don't remember (Shhh)
Wait a minute
Bartender, can you pass me a lemon
And a nice cold Tecate? Thank you
Simon
Anyways, yesterday was the bomb all night long
Gettin' drunk
Off my ass, bottoms up
On the glass
Presidente (And Coke)
1800's (No joke)
Had me feelin' like I never felt before, so pour some more
Til I hit the floor or stumble out the door
And if that happens
It's time to hit
The liquor store
Drinkin' Tecates
Or Cerveza Martina
Taking shots of tequila, while I'm la cantina

Chorus: Vocal Bizz
Catch me in la cantina
Getting drunk
La cantina
Cause that's where we party up
La cantina's mi vida
You know it's true
La cantina
Cantina, you know that I love you

(Verse 2)
I said I wouldn't drink no more, but this can't be true
Cause it's not
Even noon and I already had two
Times three
That's me, taking all that I can take
You want me to promise that I won't drink, but that's a promise I can't make
So sufferin', hungover from the night before
But the only way to fix it is to drink some more
So did I?
But of course, what you think
I'm sittin' at the bar from the beers that I won't drink
You gotta be kiddin' me, the buzz is hittin' me
Got me feelin' light-headed
I'm headed to the park, with the homie Spark
But they had some pisto there tambien
A couple twelve-packs that they jacked
I'm feelin' like there ain't no end
Cause rverywhere I go, there's alcohol til I fall
It's seven o'clock
But will I make it to last call?

[Lil' Rob]
Hey, you vatos gonna be here for a while
If so, I'll see ya
But if not, you know where I'll be homie, at the cantina

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
Back in the cantina
Sippin' my cerveza
It's gonna be the same way as last night holmes, I bet ya
Primos and friends, from one night to the other end
The wicked, wicked wino
Is getting drunk again
Stumblin'
I'm wasted
And it shows
And wouldn't be suprised if later on I'm throwin' blows
Cause that's the way it goes
And everybody knows
But I'll just relax
And go with the flow
Bartender, I'm ready for another shot and won't stop
Until I drop
Or until somebody calls the cops
My primo picked me up off the floor
And said, "Homie
You're tore up, we're cutting you off, you're not drinking anymore"
Draggin' my body up the hill to mi caton
The bar's five minutes away, but it took me a hour to get home
I've learned my leason
Rule number one of the cantina
Don't mix cerveza
With tequila

Repeat Chorus

[Lil' Rob]
You know every weekend, I say "I'm never gonna drink again"
But I'm always going back to the cantina
With mi familia
That's right
And if there's one thing I've learned
It's
Don't mix cerveza
With tequila
Ha ha
I'm warning you</pre>
