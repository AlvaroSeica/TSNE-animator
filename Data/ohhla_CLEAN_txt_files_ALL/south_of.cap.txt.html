Rzarector in the shadow
Tru Master in the shadow
Golden Arms in the shadow
12 O'clock in the shadow

Verse 1:
Crushed off the bag of dope, I felt pity
My cold thoughts evole around New York City
Evidence ?sir?, in the tunnel where the train enter
Be the gat from the old time, 86 crime, opposites attract
My electrical shine, ?ok? polly see me downtown
2 blue cops wit Rollie Fingers
We the Razor Sharp Wu-Tang singers, hum dingers
Try to connect wit pros, drug slingers
Keep heat under they clothes, everybody in the project knows
My rap shot's hot but suppose you get
Caught up in the mix, a ?non fix? of convicts
Conflict the prejudice, unrealistic
Politics, economics, chicks, counterfeit
2 face, they cliques be getting rubbed like vicks
Right off the dirty water, south of the border
Reporters and cotten bald heads paid they quarters
To see the spectator perform, cameras are litting
The return of the swarm, the nighttime storm
Little kids got bit by the rap exorcist
My chainsaw mouth split tracks for the fuck of it
Travel wit the rich, politic
Put your money on my dick
Baby, Wu-Tang is Navy
Park Hill, Staten Island seal
Rock the real to real, we ?high hill deep?
Creep, sweep beats off they feet
Teach in the cracks of the street
My family incomplete unless the Abbot in the seat
South of the border

Shaolin in the shadow
Medina in the shadow
The Emerald City in the shadow

Verse 2:
Mysteries revolve around my unorthodox sound
Splash you, I'm still the best in town
Striving for perfection wit my new rap investment
My testament, my own apartment, on a confy pay rent
More time is spent wise
Chambers of the Orient franchise, we fat like thighs
Too much french fries, not enough shake
Rza blow orchestra earthquake
No set date
Me and Bobby Steels got a cabin in Crystal Lake
Industries bug out
Hit Madison Square house, roll the red rug out
I'm loyal to the Clan, dedicated to the South
South of the Border</pre>
