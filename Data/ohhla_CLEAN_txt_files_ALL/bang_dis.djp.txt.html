[Verse One]
Yo! Oh no, here I go again, It's Blaq Po' again
Niggas hopin and prayin that I, just, throe it in
But, I can't stop I won't stop I'm too thoro
Plus, none of y'all niggas can give me any trouble
Yo dun! You outdid yourself, these niggas kid theyself
It's over for y'all niggas, when this shit hit the shelf
You want hardcore here it is
Twenty four seven Year Round like motherfuckin Bill and Fizz!!!
280, 6'1, black as fuck
And I still ain't fightin fair, nigga keep the back 'em up!
The game is out of order, niggas don't got direction
Don't worry y'all I got this, bang me in every project
Got it locked down, North, South, East to West
On some real nigga shit y'all niggas know, Preme's the best
Don't even try to fight it, don't start a fuckin riot
I take the microphone and deep fry it keep quiet
And as for drama nigga, don't even go there
Attack you with no fair, look in my eyes I don't care
Everybody builidin up, for a gang fight
Blackjacks, big gat, motherfuckin chains, knives
I know you sayin damn this bastard can flow
Y'all motherfuckers must be orphans, the last ones to know

[Chorus]
Bang this! Bang this! Motherfucker bang this!
Take a slit wrist, I make ya famous
Bang this! Bang this! Motherfucker bang this!
If you postin on the strip, if you coastin in the whip
Bang this! Bang this! Motherfucker it's the shit!
When you high as a kite, and drunk with your click
Bang this! Bang this! Bang this motherfucker bang this!!!

[Verse Two]
I turn on my radio, I cover my ears I can't have it
Where the fuck is Red Alert?!!! Where the fuck is Mr. Magic?!!!
SHIT!!! I guess I got to get with the times
My mindstate is '88, but my style is '09
I'm sick with the rhymes like, niggas sniffin some lines
Motherfuckers can't rap, gotta stick with the crimes
Bang this! Got nothin to hide I'm shameless
A wild fuckin animal you can't tame this
Ol' E guzzler, gats with the muffler
Stay on the grind, I'm a lifetime hustler
And I'm a back up, every fuckin word
Leave you on the curve all fucked up, ya heard?!
Bang this! Motherfuck them bird niggas!!!
On the real, you know how bad I'll hurt niggas
Blaq Poet!!! Yeah I'm poppin mad shit 
It's in my blood, I'mon some really bad shit
Ain't nothin funny, I got Dumb Dumbs for dmmies
I'm a O.G., but I'm gettin that new money
This is a dead end, one way
Let's gun talk, gun play, everybody gotta go one day
All that bullshit, goes to the top
I'm like the cookie at the bottom of the pot
NIGGA BANG THIS!!!</pre>
