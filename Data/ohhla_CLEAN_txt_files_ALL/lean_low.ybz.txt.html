Ooh ooh!

[Verse 1 - Sean Paul]
Now everybody pull ya' whips out, get 'em shined up
Hit the mirror make sure ya' boy leaned up
Brush up out the clean up, ya' team freezed up
I know you knew the name, gull, when you seen us
Walkin' up in the V.I-P.I.M.P when I walked by
Man, I, don't holla at no lame ho's
I go to the bar, get somethin' to sip on, for my folk
Man, this is how is goes down, where I stay
When them Tram boys done had a good day
Then I'ma buy the bar up, later on tear the car up
Flip a new one by the mornin', nigga back crunk
Good Times, if you in the club blowin' good pine
Freakin' ho's while ya' car bein' stripped down
Sick now, nowhere for her to sit down
Ya' Escalade, man, it's sittin' on bricks now

[Chorus - Seal Paul]
Lean Low (Bitch!) To the Flo' (Bitch!)
Can you work it, can you twerk it lemme know

Yeah, I'ma lean low (Nigga!) To the Flo' (Nigga!)
Can you pay what you weight gimme mo'

But Can Ya' lean low? (Bitch!) To the Flo'? (Bitch!)
Can you work it, can you twerk it lemme know

Yeah, I'ma lean low (Nigga!) To the Flo' (Nigga!)
Can you pay what you weight gimme mo'

[Verse 2 - J-Bo]
I pull up bumpin Attic, choppin, whippin' the wheel
Straight fresh off that Drizzle boy you know who it is
It's them loud-mouth motherfuckers at it again
Poppin' bottles, cuttin' up, livin' life to the end
So lean low, if you feelin like I'm feelin', let's go
Got a cup, throw it up, now hit the flo'
Shawty choosin' wit' a look and I know
Gotta lighter, fire it up and just blow
And just puff till you can't no mo'
We in the mix, backfacin' cuz that's just how it go
At the bar, we trippin', throwin' it up
Like kings in a castle, yeah we toastin' it up
So everybody, clap, and break it down
Cuz we the same old fools slidin' thru yo' town
So on yo' mark, get ready for this brand new era
Drankin' Patnaz is the name, it don't get no better

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Backbone]
Stay workin' back do', till every sack is sold
Ima hit you in the back wit' hot callico
If not then my rock, it I can hardly afford
Old school at the bar buyin' bottles of Moe
We swervin' Cheverolets up and down the road
When you hear "Shorty in town" hide ya' ho
Cuz aww shit, lil' buddy fire the dro'
I stay, fresh a fool, keep a crease in my clothes
Im puttin' on the scene, and let the champagne flow
Im tryin' to get outta here wit' somethin' freaky to poke
You know what it is, you seen it befo'
We call him "H2O, he froze ice cold"
What the fuck you sayin'? This shit is fa sho'
Tell Sean to keep 'em comin', gon' and order one mo'
Lil' Girl, work it out on the flo'
Post up young G, get drunk some mo'

[Chorus Until Fade]</pre>
