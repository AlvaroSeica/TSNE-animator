Typed by: AZ Lyrics

From the streets of San Diego to the slums of Echo Park
Broke down and homeless is where I got my start
I bounced around for years doing this and that
But now I'm doing good and I'm never looking back

I began with nothing, I still ain't got much
When life got me down I had to be tough
From the age of 14 I was on my own
No one would do it for me so I did it alone

Shelter to shelter and jail to jail
I'm here to tell you right now that I will not fail
I wish my old friends could see me now
Because they never would believe what I am doing now

I never gave up

Right now I'm where I want to be
Maybe not for you, but it's good enough for me
Don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings
All I wanna do is get on stage and sing

My dream is today and I'm doing it strong
No matter what the odds, I will still push on
I will do it for the poor who have no voice
And for all of the victims who had no choice

I will do it for the weak who cannot fight
For those who were wronged I will make things right
It's been an uphill battle, my fingers have bled
But I'm almost there and I am far from dead

I never gave up

When I came to the city of Hollywood I was broke down and beat
I slept behind dumpsters on the side of the street
There's one thing that always got me through
The one thing I always held true is that I never gave up
I'm never gonna give up</pre>
