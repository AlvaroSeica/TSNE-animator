everbody gather round for the coming attraction
come witness the dopest shit you could ever imagine
everybody talking bout what happened
word magic of a old classics the fat shit
I carry out my flow so systamatic
you never heard a record do this much damage
I mean honestly I pump it harder then your major arteries
come on you couldn't fuck with me ? your better off playing the lottery
my work ethic is expert I exert my best work hasnt been written
I'm still driven living life proper kush blunts and black vodka
everydy sessions talk shit a rap monster
knock a verse out the park I've been dope since the start
I'm a vet I can hit a curve ball in the park slugger
crossover make your heart stutter
I'm in the booth with full proof what up menno cut it up

trademark

man them niggas be fronting I know when I hear it
and when they couldnt see me with lyrics I smack the shit out there spirit
I stand stiff and deliver the gift
I kick flows like steal toes you get
watch ya live for ? I'm doing it my way dont look at me sideways
I show up at your workplace on your birthday
an piss on yo carrot cake, hold up let it marinate
throw a ghetto serinade
put on your dancing shoes and let me spark up the koolaid
make your old ass rejuvenate, yal niggas is fruity cake and you dont know who to hate, lose the face
cause your two face is to late you can fade the ace of spade jack. you cant fade the ace spade jack.

lucky tommy, what about me find me ryhming with the army
finally got us on the track and folding paper origami
99% of niggas in this business never get it
gunniess book how to finish in the top 10 then diminished then replenish
what we missing
it's the giving, it's the living
it's the pimpin
micheal givins taking boys to men's living
it the open invitation for forgiving all the sinning
been prepared to cut the ribbon
open up the package grinning, I'm a vet
always come correct, yal know me
when girls go to shows to download like soul seeks
cuff your freak
take a peak into the future, blx is living legend
bitch its getting fucking, crucial</pre>
