[Opening Skit]
Yo Sir, look at this young black here in this Cadillac
There he is, getting up 24-hours a day
Breaking my ass out here, trying to enforce law ?? 
I'ma put a foot into his ass, pull him over!
Looks like a drug dealer to me

[Verse One: Willie D]
Five-O is on my motherfucking back
Cause I'm a young black with a bad-ass Cadillac
I can't ride down the motherfucking street
Without been harassed by some bullshit police
Fucking with me like a thug
Pulling me over for suspicion of drugs
They look dumb when they say: ain't got none
So they take me down for the shotgun
That I keep in the front seat
For any dumb motherfucker who fucks with me
Charge me bitch, give me bond
I be out before the motherfucking paper works done
Having fun with my friends
Doing the same daily shit all over again
Cause I ain't being play like a sucker
By no Donut-eating-chicken white motherfucker
They can't stand to see a brother make it
I ain't got no key so stop fucking with me before you make me mad
And I pull out a heat to take care of your ass
I bought none motherfucker, if I catch you in the street close 
I'ma bust-a, cap on your ass for making me disgusting
Gotta teach your ass not to fuck with.. 

[Chorus]
Willie D don't don't don't don't don't don't don't FUCK WITH ME!!
Willie D don't don't don't don't don't don't don't ------&gt; Al Pacino as Tony Montana
One, two, three, Hit me! ----&gt; James Brown

[Verse Two: Willie D]
I'm a lover not fucker
Bitches on my dick like a tight-ass rubber
Keeping my shit hard as wood
Not because I eat them good, because I treat them good 
Chop chop chop them motherfuckers up
Hardest motherfucker, he don't give a fuck
ASCAP league down with me, combat with thick more ass than H-P-D
Get down for my crown in a second
I ain't the average fake motherfucker on the racket
Live the life that I sing about
Make a stupid-ass move, and you will find out
I don't give a fuck where you come from, son
I ain't taking shit off of nobody, cause I'm..

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Willie D]
Can act like a motherfucking fool 
So don't put me in the goddamn mood
Bum rushing these whole shit
All the mad motherfuckers are dead and that's no shit
I ain't playing over another man's wishes
I'm too busy, fucking with the bitches
Wouldn't give a damn if my friend fucked my dear
As long as you told me, we're still pairs
Let that's fly cause I'm on another level
But keep the bitch-ass til time's get better
And let her stupid-ass go
Cause ?? that whore don't stop no goddamn show
I send her ass into drama
When I pack her shit and send her back to her mama
Cause I rather have an ugly chick
Than a hardhead fine-ass pretty bitch
Who ain't down, wants me to hound
Like her pussy is the only one in town
I tell that bitch, to get on
Cause pussy ain't nothing but meat on a bone tub

[Break: Willie D]
Yo, I don't understand these stupid-ass motherfuckers 
Beating on their women for fucking on them
That still come for them like the motherfucking punks come for sucking dick
Why in the hell you don't wanna give a bitch the angry she deserves to see?
It's time for you motherfuckers to listen to me

[Verse Four: Willie D]
I got three bitches that know each other
But it's cool, cause I'm a motherfucker
I think I might spend a lot of money 
But ain't no damned bitch gonna run me 
They give each other respect
Whoever fucks up, I put them in check
So before you clown, you should know this 
She might be your girl, but she is my bitch
Whores watching drug dealers guys
And mostly they don't doubt to the next damn dime
All your friends think (Girl, you look stunning)
But bitch your turn is coming 
Fight over bitch, what for?
I loose one and gain seven more (You was a lying motherfucker!)
I'ma show you I'm not
Bitch! stop sucking my dick, telling them what I got 

[Outro]
Seven women in the palm of his hand.. Willie D
Ooh oohh ooh Willie</pre>
