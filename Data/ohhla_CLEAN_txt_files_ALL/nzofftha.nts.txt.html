Typed by: djlocskeet@yahoo.com

In the Central niggas putting in work
I didn't stay in the heart but on the rowdy ass outskirt
So watch your ass the Coast is going to take you out
Blast your ass and blow your motherfucking brains out
See its trip snoops don't learn they motherfucking lesson
Until they face to face with a fucking smith and wesson
And then they wanna start fessing
They should have been strapped and blast some fucking lead in our ass
Niggas from 7-6 is serious about the banging
We go to church with our flags and our motherfucking pants hanging
The church hoes asking when its going to stop
Bitch it don't stop till the motherfucking casket drops
I took off on a couple a niggas from the jumpstreet
Saying they down and punk Squee
You's a bitch you used to be in the Wrecking Crew
Raise your hand at me nigga I'm a bank you
You wanna squab you might wanna get 'em up
I tell you what nigga get up on these nuts
Greedy G, Lil Keke, and Lil Squee
Cuz we some niggaz off the street

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Homies all standing around just hanging (Ice Cube)
Some dope dealing some gangbanging (Ice Cube)
Niggas getting ready for the big bang (Scarface)
Suckers getting over by slanging caine (Ice Cube)

Thuggin never duckin never givin a fuckin
Cuz I think most motherfuckers is cluckin
Greedy G Original from the Darkside
Mobbin a 6-4 g-ride
Motherfuckers just don't wanna C me
Cuz Im a nigga with a gang of Hennessey
Courvoisier, and a gang a Remy Martin
Boones, Miller Genuine Draft, a lil something
I got indo all on my floor
I don't smoke no thai bud no more
Cuz I'm a nigga wit a gang a static
If I ain't strapped then Champ got the automatic
To peel the cap of a motherfucker
Put his brains and shit where? All in the gutter
I drive a 4 so that should tell you something
I don't give a fuck about nothing
I go anywhere I wanna go Lynwood, Compton, Watts, and South Central
A big bear wit my crew in the back
A pitbull and the grim reaper holding the ax
And the tombstone lets you know hey Dj Quik Dj Quik fuck slow
I wanna rep the big blue wrecking crew
And you gotta I can't stand a Piru
Hi-c fuck em, Second II None fuck em, Amg fuck em, Dj Quik fuck 'em
I gotta homie that's a G Harlem Rip c-rider by the name of Keke
So little loco won't you kick the facts
and tell 'em niggas off the street ain't going for that

[Chorus]

Buster ass niggas selling dope
Scared to gangbang so they try to push coke
But ain't no future in your frontin
So kick back and chill and learn a little something
From the South Central kid
