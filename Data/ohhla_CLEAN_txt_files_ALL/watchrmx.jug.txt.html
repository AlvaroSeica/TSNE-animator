A mind is a terrible thing to waste
You face disposal running your mouth with no skill (Watch ya head!)
Your dome piece to ya ass crackin
So brother bring it live or it'll be your last yappin

A mind is a terrible thing to waste
You face disposal running your mouth with no skill (Watch ya head!)
Your dome piece to ya ass crackin
Mess around I got to send that ass packin

check it out:

Well it's the glue sniffin keep it cool whiffin thought strangler
Embarrassin niggaz like when your mama bought wrangler jeans 'n
I fiends in the funk ways you know me
Nobody say, "cut 'em all the same just like a Flowbie"
Now blow me down south my gift pursued stupid mad heads bite
I'm feelin like the fifth of food groups, it's too much
You clutch mics, I rip with arthritis grip
You game your claim to fame so mo' Midas shit
Golden cash and big bold and brash and +pig did that+
Types and style moldin fashion
Well I'ma break ya down like grief
Mic chief in charge 'n get shrunk and turn self enlargin
Thus be born before you comes troublin
Cause I'll be all up in that bitch ass like jum smugglin
Jugglin flows mad trying to keep the funk live-er
So just recognize and give me more space than drunk drivers

A mind is a terrible thing to waste
You face disposal running your mouth with no skill (Watch ya head!)
Your dome piece to ya ass crackin
So brother bring it live or it'll be your last yappin

A mind is a terrible thing to waste
You face disposal running your mouth with no skill (Watch ya head!)
Your dome piece to ya ass crackin
Mess around I got to send that ass packin</pre>
