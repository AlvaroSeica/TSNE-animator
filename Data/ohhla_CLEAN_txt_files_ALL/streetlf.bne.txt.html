[Intro: Bizzy] + (Layzie)
Turn it up, turn that track up
We're livin that street life, heat life
Turn it up some mo' Â– we're livin the
We're livin the, we're livin the, we're livin the
We're livin that street life, we're livin that
Yeah - turn it up some mo', turn it up some mo'
We're livin that street life, we're livin that street life
We're livin the, we're livin the, we're livin the
Yeah, yeah (Bizzy Bone and L-Burna baby)

[Chorus: Bizzy] + (Layzie)
We're livin the, we're livin the, we're livin the
We're livin that street life, heat life
(Yeahhhh, what goes around comes around double on that ass)
Tell 'em to find a path - livin that street life, heat life
(Yeahhhh, what goes around comes around double on that ass)
Now give me a dollar right outta my cash
Livin that street life, heat life
(Yeahhhh, what goes around comes around double on that ass)
Uh, yeah, ooh - tell 'em to find a path
Livin that street life, heat life
(Yeahhhh, what goes around comes around double on that ass)
Haha, c'mon, yeah - now give me a dollar right outta my cash

[Bizzy Bone]
You ever seen people confused in these streets, beggin for change, lookin for heat
Walkin with nothin to eat, smokin the square, livin that street life
Usually give 'em some money and wonder what hurt 'em so much in they past
Hard to repent for they sins, especially when they not in and then they last
Lose they family and friends and everyone changes, faces turnin to masks
Old and they sleepin in souls, lookin for light, sippin this good they found in the flask
Cause didn't you want a piece of bread? Hand in they feet, speak to the dead
The tip of the temple, the head, eyes shinin and red, give them a sec
They could be angels, they could be men, visitin Heaven they dreams
Sit on the corner they filled with the papers they doin the service but what does it mean?
Is it the situation though for me to be takin a ride (let's take a ride) every time?
Let 'em flip on the radio, battlin demons, can't keep me outside
I went through the drama and caught up in all of the lies, whatever was on my side
Christ provided my body, you told me I'm Bryon, and this is your life
But the demons off, they hittin me
I'm pittin the question, please Father just save me from hell
(Bizzy Bone and L-Burna baby)

[Chorus]

[Layzie Bone]
You're new to the drama, I heard about karma, what go around come around quick on that ass
Addicted to cash, I'm keepin your stash, I sit and I wonder "How long will it last?"
Street life, heat life 'til me and my niggaz perish, perish
Me and B tight, that's right, them niggaz you know I cherish, cherish (yeah)
Show me the nigga that's ready to suit up and boot up for a revolution
I'ma show you the ones that's ready to get out and bleed for a resolution
These streets is a motherfucker, rough enough to make a nigga wonder
"What's a nigga's purpose? Is it really worth it?
Is a nigga just really another number dawg?"
If I'm just a number, then I'm infinity, infinity
I'm always movin and I'm never endin, and I'm blastin on my enemies
Movin fast while I blow on trees, quick to cock it and I'm quick to squeeze
Disrespect it on any level I'ma let 'em pop it and I'ma make 'em bleed
I come from the part of the city where it's death before dishonor
You don't cross a man that's the boss of theirs so tomorrow just ain't promised
Get money nigga, ball out, walk the walk if you're with me
You know the road, let's go all out, better talk to 'em Bizzy

[Chorus]

[Bizzy Bone]
You're rollin and thinkin of ways that we livin the purpose, why some feelin worthless?
Of course it gets rough when I see tribulations the brain is like dirt for so many nations
Temptations, indications, revelations, the residence deep in the mind
Blindfolded, never know when sooner or later your eyes'll be open to light
How are you livin in prison in different conditions? With vision you don't wanna live
What are you searchin for kid? What are you hurtin for kid?
Livin that street life, word thug, plenty love, holler back
When the struggle is over it's over soldier, told ya, swallow that

[Layzie Bone]
Let me holler at 'em...
A lot of my niggaz is stuck in the streets, nowhere to go and nothin to eat
What are we doin? It's nothin for free, we carry the heat and we're playin for keeps
Shit can get deep when there's snow on the ground 
and maybe your peoples ain't holdin you down
You wonder why niggaz is loc'in up now, life is too hard when you're low to the ground
I'm grippin my bible, the heck with survival
I'm liable to flip out, that's why I just pray
One day at a time I keep tellin myself, hopin I find a better way
But until then it's the street life (street life)
Nigga I can't get away from that street life, street life

[Chorus]</pre>
