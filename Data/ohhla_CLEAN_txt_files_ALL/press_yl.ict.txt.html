[Intro: Ice-T]
Yeah, got my nigga J-E-L, Rhyme Poetic Mafia in the house
Tired of all niggaz mad-dogging like you might wanna do something
Yeah, I'm right here nigga, Come On!

[Verse One: Powerlord JEL]
Can you deal with my game when I pull your card?
It's Do or Die motherfucker, now let's credit discards
Cause my Trey-Five-Seven take out your chest
And if you don't sport a vest then you'll die like the rest
Cause you can't compete, with the Goddamn street
Cause the man that wants something, is the one that speaks
So don't press your luck, man don't push me to the max
Cause after that, then you was a goner black
It only takes one twitch, of my itchy twinger finger
And out comes the reaper; in the low time sneakers
I'll snick you, just to piss on your grave
Now raiding brave, but no one can save
Just the Mexican homes ask to play with debt
Now if you wanna trip, you can place that bet
But I'll make you regret the lifestyle you picked
Cause the style that you picked, wasn't worked jack-shit!

[Interlude #1: Powerlord JEL]
If you're feeling lucky, duck and press your luck!
Make your move motherfucker, Come On!
If you're feeling lucky, duck and press your luck!
What you're waiting on fool? - Come On!
If you're feeling lucky, duck and press your luck!
I'm right here little fucker, Come On!
If you're feeling lucky, duck and press your luck!

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
You hop skip it, but if you flipped you'll die
I don't play kid, nigga don't trip, don't try
Don't even think about maneuver and that take me out
You'll come up missing motherfucker, you're lost one route
It gets dark in your head, and your chest dump wet
You roll the Ice on your dice and you're lost your bet
Bad mood, you should've been thinking about the niggaz sleeping in shallow graves
Bodies stinking cause I kept bad wreck on those who disrespect
No bodyguard, no Kell-bark, believe it
I don't like it when you look in my face like that
Like owe the nigga something, better ease on back
Why? - you wanna mess with the buckwild or stick with me
You'll get toe tagged G, of tocsin
A big balling nigga bringing drama fool
You ain't learnt yet, then bring your ass to school

[Interlude #2: Ice-T]
If you're feeling lucky, duck and press your luck!
What you're waiting on nigga? - Come On!
If you're feeling lucky, duck and press your luck!
Make your move motherfucker, Come On!
If you're feeling lucky, duck and press your luck!
What you're waiting on kid? - Come On!
If you're feeling lucky, duck and press your luck!

[Verse Three: Powerlord JEL]
Enter the darkness, with the most idiotest man
That planned to have his days when the West was slammed
Cause ain't.. no style wicked like the one I got
And there ain't nobody deader than the ones I shot
In the alley, on the block, on the stage with Tee
But when you see, you ain't nothing to criticize me
Cause the Mexicans had it, now I'm feeling the vibe
And now I'm dropping on murder and I lam with their tribes
Cause they're fucking with my funk, that puts them in the trunk
Right next to the punks, and another stiff chunk
Cause they talk so swift, like snakes I can't trust them
I rather hit them up, snap back, and go bust them
With all of Locs, cause one number just wrong
But if you're just a little bitch, how can you go on?
I couldn't live with the fact, I couldn't freak a track
Cold intimidate the fools that call on my back
Cause they're cruising for a bruising; if they flex again
Plus, I know they can't handle the Mexican, Yeah!

[Interlude #3: Powerlord JEL]
If you're feeling lucky, duck and press your luck!
Make your move motherfucker, Come On!
If you're feeling lucky, duck and press your luck!
What you're waiting on fool? - Come On!
If you're feeling lucky, duck and press your luck!
I'm right here motherfucker, Come On!
If you're feeling lucky, duck and press your luck!

[Verse Four: Ice-T]
Don't step because I will open your head
A hot dump to your chest, now your back is all red
I told you if you move, you will regret it
Now you're looking up at the bloody paramedic
You fucked that up, my .45 is in my waist
Just incase, some buster stepped out of his motherfucking face
All night, I just kicked it in the corner
Niggaz rolled up, tripping (*POP!*) goners
Bag them up, sew them up, freeze them
Another mother cries out for no apparent reason
But the streets ain't nice, to tell the truth, they're whack
I hit some brothers with the Peace Sign, they mad-dog back
Yo, they see me on a TV Show
They heard I keep out fat role and they want my goal
So I.. locked in on the eyes of a leader
Fell my heart beat rise, as he moved for his heater
But the nigga never pulled as fine
Cause I already had that Hummer back on mine (YEAH!)

[Interlude #4: Ice-T]
If you're feeling lucky, duck and press your luck!
Make your move bitch, Come On!
If you're feeling lucky, duck and press your luck!
What you're waiting on punk? - Come On!
If you're feeling lucky, duck and press your luck!
I'm right here motherfucker, Come On!
If you're feeling lucky, duck and press your luck!

[Outro: Ice-T]
Press your luck!
If you're feeling lucky, duck and press your luck! </pre>
