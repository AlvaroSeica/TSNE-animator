I seen a fly slimmy on the avenue
When I was on tour in Baton Rouge
A mean little missy with a attitude
I played it smooth, no need to be rude
I stopped the ship, stepped off like chewie
Ran some game like Louie Louie
Talked her on the bus, talked her out of her shorts
No liar ho, I'm here to report

She had some cadillac pussy
Some cadillac pussy
She had some cadillac pussy
Some cadillac pussy
She had some cadillac pussy
Mand it would drive you wild

I seen a fly slimmy on the avenue
When I was on tour in Baton Rouge
A mean little missy with a attitude
I played it smooth, no need to be rude
I stopped the ship, stepped off like chewie
Ran some game like Louie Louie
Talked her on the bus, talked her out of her shorts
No liar ho, I'm here to report

She had some cadillac pussy
Some cadillac pussy
She had some cadillac pussy
Some cadillac pussy
She had some cadillac pussy
Mand it would drive you wild

She had some cadillac pussy
Man it would drive you wild

One, two, three, four
Cadillac pussy, cadillac pussy
Cadillac pussy, cadillac pussy
She had some cadillac pussy
Man it would drive you wild</pre>
