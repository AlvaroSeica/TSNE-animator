	STOP!  Man whatchu gonna do now?

[Takbir]
Now I'ma break it down just to tell a little story
Straight off the top, with no specific category
Welcome to another rendition of what we call freefall
About time, we decide to ball
with the mind of a junkyard hog ready to brawl
witcha hype man, retrievin the mysterious mic stand

[Ryu]
Yo, murderin the first 12 Monkeys in a face-off the top
Flip my claws out, fangs for bloody thirst
The curse of a person conversin in tongues for funds
Punchlines like loaded nines won't survive in my dimension
Divide the sector seven into pie graph
Twenty-five percent passed, ten percent dissed, the other half
talk fast and don't say {shit} like deaf mutes
My def boots, trample on troops, samples applied, wire detonate
mic fires in Beirut, cards of the same suit
A half deck, catchin half wreck, that was your last bet

[Styles of Beyond]
Now, whether you like it or not, we still arrive
Bright and early up in yo' face with somethin live
The crew that makes you wake up, stop and peep notice..
Notice.. "Open your eyes and try to focus"

[Takbir]
I think it's time to wake up (for what) to hear the dope stuff
You know the stuff that Ryu and Tak' drop on the hush
The sound that people wanna pound but don't touch
We slow the platoons like water balloons in a bunch
We oughta resume to crunch your half rhyme pasttime
Call out fakes, see me at the bank in the cash line
Not a greedy pig, but indeed he did do (what was that?)
Tried to get cold, when I'm an igloo

[Ryu]
Don't you know what you got into, into got you what?
No you don't, attack this with bass-ackwards tactics
will get you on my blacklist, quick-er
than you can pass or flip the flea flicker
Run the hundred yard dash, pass Flash Gordon
flippin the bird, trippin over tongue tied words

[Takbir]
Yeah these unsigned nerds, stuck with a memo on the back {hahah}
Floodin the underground with weak demos on wax
(Like that?)  Like that, and that's the way it'll be
Cause when my empire strikes back vigorously

[Styles of Beyond]
Here comes the crew that makes you wake up, stop and peep notice..

	Endangered (4X)

[Ryu]
Aiyyo, is that your bag, I'll help you pack it
Cause that's the, last time you steppin to Cali kickin some wack {shit}
Feel the wrath of Iron Patrick, rippin apart
your poetry thoughts, w-dots, ? bought boxes
of cheap art and stolen parts from the chop shop
Used to be hip-hop, converted to a drop top

[Takbir]
Hah, no longer legit for hopscotch, the oil gauge
key to ignite drips the plot
Stuck in the service shop, we heard a lot of same stuff played
Quick to identify like a friendly game of charades

.. so whatcha whatcha want?

	Endangered.. (5X)</pre>
