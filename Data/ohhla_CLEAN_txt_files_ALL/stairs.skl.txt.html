(Skee-Lo)
Growin up as a kid tough skins and Afros 
Wasn't South Central, but still it came natural 
There wasn't nobody to watch my back
Didn't wanna be strapped to get jacked
Mama taught me not to trust no man
Brother what's your plan?
If you ever lose a fight, then you go back again and win
And I don't care if it was one of your friends 
You better bury your feelings within
And understand that on top of the stairs
They got keys to Catalacs BMW's Mercedes, Benz and all of that
And on top of the stairs yeah
They got colour TV's and even girls come in two pairs
And on the bottom you've got nothin but guilt 
Bad feelings bein kept homies been killed 
When I die always know that I never was see my little brother drop
So you better stay on top

(Chorus)
(Skee-Lo)
Cause no one really cares about the guy on the bottom 
No one really cares about the guy beneath
And everybody wants to be down with the dude 
On top of the stairs, top of the stairs  
Cause no one really cares about the guy on the bottom 
No one really cares about the guy beneath
And everybody wants to be down with the dude 
On top of the stairs, top of the stairs

(Skee-Lo)
Little brother look around you, can't you see
All the possibilities and we, you and me  
To the bang boogie up jump the boogie 
to the boogie to the boogie to the beat, I'ma emcee
I spent three years in Mickey D's cleanin dishes 
Half of that time was makin wishes 
Want ya hit switches in a brand new six-fo'
But all I could afford was another nine and Roseau's Chicken and Waffles 
How bout that Honda Cord 
Used to watch drop by at night till I got bored 
But not no more really that's for sure 
Cause I gotta million honeys knockin on my door
And I'm not tryin to score with one 
Cause diseases kill and that's ill 
To make a mill in you gettin done 
When you on top of the world girls may come 
But when you fall down you won't find one

(Chorus)
(Skee-Lo)
Cause no one really cares about the guy on the bottom 
No one really cares about the guy beneath
And everybody wants to be down with the dude 
On top of the stairs, top of the stairs  
Cause no one really cares about the guy on the bottom 
No one really cares about the guy beneath
And everybody wants to be down with the dude 
On top of the stairs, top of the stairs

(Skee-Lo)
Little brother this is all we got
Me and you will be cruel 
Even though it doesn't seem like a lot, it is
So don't be thinkin negative 
I know just how you feel when you got time to kill I'll tell you how it is 
I know you might be unsure
Cause it gets rough out there and when it rains and pours
I stole shoes from stores hung out with cool cats
Put cars on flats broke windows with bats
And that's not all even made prank phone calls 
I was flossin and sloshin in Fox Hills Mall (So whattup y'all?)
After all please check my credentials
I once got busy in the whenchles yeah
So throw your hands in the air
Wave em around if you've been treated unfair
Yeah cause no one cares (no one cares, no one cares)
Top of the stairs (top of the stairs, top of the stairs)

(Chorus)
(Skee-Lo)
Cause no one really cares about the guy on the bottom 
No one really cares about the guy beneath
And everybody wants to be down with the dude 
On top of the stairs, top of the stairs  
Cause no one really cares about the guy on the bottom 
No one really cares about the guy beneath
And everybody wants to be down with the dude 
On top of the stairs, top of the stairs
Cause no one really cares about the guy on the bottom 
No one really cares about the guy beneath
And everybody wants to be down with the dude 
On top of the stairs, top of the stairs  
Cause no one really cares about the guy on the bottom 
No one really cares about the guy beneath
And everybody wants to be down with the dude 
On top of the stairs, top of the stairs 

(Skee-Lo)
Yeah to all my little brothers out there
It's cool to be on top, but don't ever forget where you came from
Most importantly you better remember
The little guy you step on to get on top 
Is the same guy you gonna run into goin back down 
Yeah top of the stairs </pre>
