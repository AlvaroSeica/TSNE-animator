Song:   Break it Down
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Let's go!

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Break it down (down down down down...)
Gotta get up (get up), say what
Get up (get up), say what

[Hopsin]
Now may I kick a flow for y'all
That's slow and raw
For niggaz who thinkin the west coast fell off
But first, I'd like to give a little toast to all
Who's souls was lost up in the rap flows in all (gee)
Back to my original topic
Fuck the bullshit you should be gettin with Hopsin
On that real rap shit man forget the imposters
Y'all destroyed hip-hop (good) mission accomplished
Now I'ma make them regret this shit
Bringin back all the elements
Makin these fellas swell up
And tell them that fuckin hell is hit
I got to focus though
And come down on all my zoning's yo
Because I'm prone to blow
And destroy all my lyric chromosomes
I told you folks that it's over
So go and roll up your soldiers
And be up out this bitch like hocus pocus
I'm so ferocious I had the potion but no one noticed
And now I'm about to blow up even bigger than my nose is

[Chorus]

[Hopsin]
I'd like to bust another verse if I may
The mess I made, make rappers want to catch my fade
I'm just not sane, all y'all affect my brain
So don't be runnin up tryin to put me in headlocks mayne
It's like I pin em like a poster, get em and then roast em
When it comes to this verbal abuses, do not approach him
I toast em, bury them in an oasis
Then write a book on how I did it like O.J. did (stupid stupid)
I'm that new nigga all the kids gonna look up to
With a middle finger in the sky screamin "Fuck school"
You don't want your child bumpin Hop? Nigga fuck you
Who's a better dad? You or me? Let your son choose
Girl, why you actin so passionate?
You smilin at me like I was attracted to fat women
Shit, go dance your ass up in the cut with your big butt
Come to think about it, never mind I could use a nut

[Chorus]

[Hopsin]
Still the same nigga, still usin Fruity Loops
Play this shit up in the club, watch what her booty do
I ain't got to fuck with all the high tech shit
I keep the kitchen grimy cookin up my next hit
I guess it's how I was raised, and now I get paid
To go and write some bullshit a couple hours a day
I just pop a tune on and the music will move me
My message is deeper than this shit if you listen closely
Yo, I got a habit for smashin faggots
In fact I'm a dashin rappin savage
Assassin who has a passion
To just see 'em, read 'em, eat 'em
Beat em, flee 'em then feed 'em to muselina
I seem to be the most heated speaker
I'll defeat your leader, freak your diva then freakin leave her
Hopsin, he a demon, y'all knowin he a beast (what!)
How the fuck am I supposed to act?
The West coast is back!

[Chorus]</pre>
