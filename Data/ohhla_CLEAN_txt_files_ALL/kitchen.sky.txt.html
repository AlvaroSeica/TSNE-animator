[Skyzoo]
Vowed to never live on my knees
Never beg, I'm never fed, off of "gimme" or "please"
I never bled off of crawlin'
so if I should bleed it's from my hands dry wallin'
Holdin' this shit is me
Every wall that I installed, every entrance you see
I drew it all and through it all, up to just what it be
Knew it all, true to all, movin' on, true to form
Forgiveness is at the end and I got endings to weave
Attaching 'em where they meet at
Back to where my lean at
Dreams got wings but they clippin' 'em where they breathe at
so fuck tryin' to sing I'm tryin' to swing where the seat's at
And know that anything that I bring, I'm tryin' to read that
I try to fight a feelin' but the feeling subsides
And the high that you've been given when you get to provide
is to find the ambition that you wish to revive
Live and die, but while you livin', keep the kitchen in mind

[Chorus: Skyzoo]
And remember, the place mats is laid where they should be at
and everybody made they way to where they seats at
Feel like all eyes on me from how they need that
Can't be mad at 'em cause here is where they eat at
So me, I'm tryin' to decorate the kitchen table
and put enough around for everyone of them mouths
I mean, I'm just tryin' to decorate the kitchen table
And put enough around for everyone sittin' down
I mean...

[Skyzoo]
The process of providin' and tryin' to find it
and words passin' the margin and contemplating consignment
And circle backwards and forwards and fallin' for the reminder
then stressin' over these plates and the utensils that's beside 'em
You countin' three times and hopin' you counted wrong
'Till all of the count is gone
and all that you counted on ain't on the table
And you was suppose to make sure that was decent
And now all this decoratin' is needed
Never waited to see it cause ain't nobody waitin' to be seated
and they ain't tryin' to change up how they eatin'
Man of the house entails bringin' home anything but a reason
Cause a reason can't clear away the grievance
So fuck all that
Before departin' I'll turn into G. Garvin
As long as the plate is straight I can deal with the deeper margins
Long as I'm 808 I can deal with being a target
Long as we ate today you can call it what you call it

[Chorus: Skyzoo]
But remember, the place mats is laid where they should be at
and everybody made they way to where they seats at
Feel like all eyes on me from how they need that
Can't be mad at 'em cause here is where they eat at
So me, I'm tryin' to decorate the kitchen table
and put enough around for everyone of them mouths
I mean, I'm just tryin' to decorate the kitchen table
and put enough around for everyone sittin' down
And remember, the place mats is laid where they should be at
and everybody made they way to where they seats at
Feel like all eyes on me from how they need that
Can't be mad at 'em cause here is where they eat at
So me, I'm tryin' to decorate the kitchen table
and put enough around for everyone of them mouths
I mean, I'm just tryin' to decorate the kitchen table
And put enough around for everyone sittin' down
I mean...

[Dialogue from "Do The Right Thing"]

Buggin' Out: How you be, man?
Radio Raheem: Livin' large, bro!
Buggin' Out: Yo, check this, man, you know Sal's?
Radio Raheem: Yeah, I know that motherfucker
Buggin' Out: I be tryin' to organize a boycott of Sal's Famous, you know what I'm sayin'?
Radio Raheem: I almost had to bust him in the head today, man!
Goin' tell me, tell me, Radio Raheem, to turn down my box and shit
man, and he didn't even say please
Who the fuck he think he is, Don Corleone and shit? 
Buggin' Out: He make MUCH money off us black people
and all he got up on them wall is EYE-taliens

motherfuckers, you see what I'm sayin', homeboy?
Radio Raheem: On the strength!
Buggin' Out: Yeah, we shouldn't buy one slice
Spend one red penny up in there until he puts some folks of color up on that wall!
Radio Raheem: That's what I'm tal - that's what I'm talkin' about, man!
Buggin' Out: Yo, you got my back?
Radio Raheem: Your back is got!
Buggin' Out: My brother!
Radio Raheem: My brother!</pre>
