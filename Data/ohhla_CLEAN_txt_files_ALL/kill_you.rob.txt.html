[Dominator]
Big I-1-3, motherfucker
Big I-1-3

(Main Verse)
[Dominator]
Another jam from the mind of the double D
I put it down for the homies in the Central Coast Family
Some wicked shit poundin' out your box
A little somethin' to bump
When you're cookin' them rocks
We all got our own ways of makin' the green
You do whatever it takes, to get up onto the scene
I do what I do, stayin' true to the blue
Southside 1-3, what about you, fool
Run and hide, and get out your map
Leva motherfuckers live the other side to the tracks
I never forgive a punk, I never forget
It ain't over, motherfuckers, no, not just yet
Move out the scene
I knew you would leave
I got another motherfuckin' trick up my sleeve
Smoke you like a roach, can I make it last
Like a quick half ounce, another thing from the past
You're the kind of motherfucker talkin' shit (Bitch)
I'm the kind of motherfucker makin' the hit (List)
When I see you in the street, you better run and cover
Cause if I pull out my gat, I shoot to kill, motherfucker

[Lil' Rob]
It's the Lil' Rob
Known like the mob, cause I be droppin' them hits
Givin' it til you whores can't stand
Givin' it til your heart quits
Splits open
Hopin'
For another chance
Fuck that fat heina, it's ain't over til these devils dance
Glance, at a man with no worries, full of fury
Riddle let
Loose, hang you fools from a noose, then
Light you up on fire
Put away my lighter
Fuck the fuckin' devil, I'm the one that he admires
Inquirin' minds want to know
How the fuck
We can be so fuckin' sick and quick to stick
Pussy
The cheif enemies got the remedy
To make more enemies than anybody in the pen with a felony
Now you're mad at me
I'm just glad that we
Had the chance
To be friendly, before I killed you fuckin' family
Say you're understandin' me
Fool, you ain't no man to me
Pullin' petty crimes, thinkin' that you're gonna flatter me
Bitch, I can give a fuck about
What you're doin'
I could give a fuck about, what
Crew that you flew
Make you sick like the flu, I know how to spook you
All it takes, is a bullet, leave ya shakin' in your shoes
What kind of death
Do you choose, homicide or suicide?
Circle one, call me Gato, cause the cat
Got your toungue
Ese young, twenty-one, people sayin' that I'm done
But the more shit that you talk, the more
Fun has begun
Leave your ass rung, let alone your ass hung
Chop you up with my machete with my hockey mask on
Or better yet, I'll paint my face up
Like Dead Presidents
In your neighborhood, ain't nothin' but dead residents
When I get through with them
Set them up and have a brew with them
While the juras wonderin' what to do with them
Cause there's so many of them, God must not have loved them
Cause he let me do what I did, closed their eye lids

[Mr. Shadow]
Now who be man enough to come and try to test my skills
It's that evil minded demon, shovin' fools under the hills
Motherfuckers try to run, but they can never hide, I find 'em
Put in the puzzle together with venomous tips, I'm gonna blind 'em
Shadow be that one bald-headed fool, ready to bust
The man I swish up til my rival's into fuckin' dust
I must admit to all the shit that I commited
All the fuckin' bodies and the craniums that I splitted
I spitted many rhymes
I took so many lives
All my foes are now depressed, it's like the year of '95
Homicide got me trippin'
That's why I'm loadin' a clip
Motherfuckers tryin' to trip, they end up lookin' just like shit</pre>
