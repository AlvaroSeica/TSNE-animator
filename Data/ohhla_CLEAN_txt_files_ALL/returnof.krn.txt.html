[Intro]
Your men with all their foolish spells
Cannot protect you from my power

[K-Rino]
Sitting in the living room, no one's in the house
In and out out consciousness, dozing on the couch
Approximately midnight, nothing else around
Light sleep woke up suddenly, awakened by the sound
The room got colder, in a manner that was strange
I tried to turn the TV, but the channel wouldn't change
I started feeling angry, then shocked by what I seen
No picture, but a dark mist appeared up on the screen
Five seconds later, I began to feel a threat
What was looming, I'm assuming was a human silhouette
The minute that I thought to myself, it couldn't get me
I looked up and saw the same image, right there standing with me
I froze up and wondered, what was next for him to do
He said do you remember me, cause I remember you
I said no not really, but I think I have a clue
What I'm thinking in my mind, though I'm hoping isn't true

[Chorus - 2x]
It's the return of the sorcerer, you could never win
Thought you got rid of me, now I'm back for my revenge
Didn't know you were the wizard, when I met you in my den
Now I'm back, fully reloaded to challenge you again

[K-Rino]
No need for playing dumb, asking me who is it
You know exactly who I am, and why I came to visit
I said, I destroyed the sorcerer he said don't tempt me
I raced to get the bag I placed him in, but it was empty
I said how did you get out man, I check this every hour
He said I formed again, and reconnected with my power
I stay inside the bag, while my energy increases
The mistake you made, is that you didn't separate my desist
So everyday I got strong, and life began to form
I spawned a set of horns, that shoot nitrogen in bombs
You set me up the last time we met, and that was rude
Now the sorcery I use, is quadruple the magnitude
I must admit, you proved to be a worthy nemesis
But now you have no chance, of removing me from the premises
So now this vulnerable state, in which I've rendered you
Has disabled the mystic wizardry, that has befriended you

[Chorus - 2x]

[K-Rino]
I felt myself getting smaller, breathing getting harder
He said I need to make you shrink, I made the room larger
He made his voice change, into high decibel pitches
He went into my brain, and started tampering with switches
He synchronized our minds, and my vision got spotty
And played games, by switching my head to his body
I said quit playing with my thoughts, and making images
Now that I mention it, please stop finishing my sentences
Yeah, and then he started laughing
I mustered up enough strength, to back spin and zap him
He's still standing, when I know how hard I hit him
He brushed it off, as if a mosquito had bit him
So now I'm getting nervous, kinda feeling like it's curtains
My body's getting weaker, he's defeated me for certain
I felt my system malfunctioning, shutting down completely
Body effected deeply, I'm not feeling good I'm sleepy

[Chorus - 2x]

[K-Rino]
He threw me in the lab, I was confused by that one
Not because he put me there, because I didn't have one
He came and said it's over, now I can't think of much more to do
He said it's time to finish you, but first I'm gonna torture you
So now I'm saying, this is too insane
By then, ninety percent of my wizardry was drained
I looked right in his face, really wishing I could sign a truce
Then noticed a particle of skin on it, was kinda loose
Hmmm, there might be a way that I can beat this
I recollected, what he had told me about his desist
To disassemble his physical features, is his weakness
The key is knocking off that loose part, if I could reach it
I used the last drop, of my telekinesis
And snatched that little patch off his face, fed it to leaches
He screamed, as his head started melting from the damage
As my power reestablished, the rest of his body vanished
