[Intro: Babyface Fensta]
Yo, yo, yo...
Yeah... yeah... ok... (Babyface!)

[Babyface Fensta]
Fensta has no equal, Cno Evil, Knievel
Stuntmen, tell the people, why you gotta front man?
The drama, they don't really want, man
Need to relax, go smoke a blunt, man
Word, stop fronting, talking bout nothing
Biting, reclying flows, ya'll dudes ain't pros
You got your raincoats on, you bout to get wet
Rat-tat-tat-tat, get flat-tat-tat-tat
Lyrical shot-tot-tot-tot, gun, the mask got-got-got
Don't jump-pump-pump-pump, Fensta mash up-pup-pup
The dance bwoy, many, some space razor pa-pump
Impeach the leech witness, B-E-A-A-A-A-st
Then to teach, for re-re-reef, the you-you-you-you-you-youth
With the truuuuuuuuuuuuth, give 'em the proooooooooooof
Hundred percent authentic, vampire, mystic garlic

[Chorus 2X: Babyface Fensta]
If they don't know, and I know
Living in the sure and the way
To go, my love, yo I cherish above
Anything they can think of

[Babyface Fensta]
Ring-a-ding-ding, sting-a-ding-ding
Ping-ping-ping-ping, pong
My song along the whole nation
Across the globe, tackle Babylon
What do dem not write, with no weak drum
People get ready, they strung
I know it's been long-long-long-long
Long-long-long-long-long-long-long
Me say, Fensta tried so come-come-come-come-come
Them fast it soon, done-deh-deh-dem
Done-deh-deh-dem, done-deh-deh-dem
Them said they fast is soon, done-deh-deh-deh-dem
Whoa!

[Chorus 2X]

[Babyface Fensta]
It's fantastic, I'm selected to be electric
Your house, don't bet it, my words prophetic
Your rap is pathetic, wanna let out the hatred
Might regret it, I see the clones, in my zone
Trynna dethrone the king, but I'm the father
The master, everything, they not, can't stop my bum rush
Wont, don't, dare, compare, them guys to muah
Say Andre Butwa, to understand, I'm the original black man
From the continent of Asia, born in America
Modern day Soddom and Gomorrah, here to change the fizza-formula
Follow me, check-a vampire, pon fire
Pon mi fasi, won me non retire, I'm here to take you higher
Level-level, forward selecting, striking
With the thunder and lightning, this be a Fensta writing
No pen &amp; paper, just mental exercising
Fensta, always, mash the session
Trun-trun, trun-te-tun-tun-tun, tun!

[Outro: Babyface Fensta]
Yeah, big up 90's, big up all the people all over the world
Brooklyn Zu, Buddha Monk, Q-Plex, all my peoples
One love, yeah, yeah </pre>
