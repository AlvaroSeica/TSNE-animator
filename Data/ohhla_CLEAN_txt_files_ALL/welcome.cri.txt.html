Verse 1 (Cristiles):

It's Cristiles and you know the name
stop comparin' me to rappers we don't flow the same
you know the feelin' when everybody you know has changed
I used to fuck with them lames man I'm so ashamed
so you know I gotta make up for that shit
rap pitch money I'm on plate up to bat bitch
hittin' home runs on the game you can bet
make the day you betrayed me the day you regret
we the hottest in the Bay give a fuck what you think
keep you eyes on the prize, your'e fucked if you blink
I'm higher than the sky, my cup full of drink
what am I? you could say I'm just somethin' you ain't
women love my stilo, that's what they tellin' me
in the club with D-Lo might catch a felony
that's how it go though, you already know though
shit even Chris Brown don't five a fuck about no hoe

Chorus (Cristiles):

When she drop it to the floor

Verse 2 (D-Lo):

I fell in love with two bitches yeah that's my glock and my cheese
I ain't the hardest nigga out but I'll cock it and squeeze

I got money in rubber bands boy
we don't ride scrapers or vans we ride fast toys
big shit big clips I'm talkin' thirty dicks
my choppa know gymnastics boy, don't get flipped
I'm gettin' cash money like them hot boyz
I'm finna be sittin' on twenty eights like them top boys
I sip medicine out of sprite bottles

that mean I'm pimpin' Caucasians smoke too many blunts now a nigga look asian
that mean I'm pimpin' Caucasians smoke too many blunts now a nigga look asian

Verse 3 (Cristiles):

bitches love me, I put that on my mother man

hit it once guaranteed that she fin to want to fuck again
I'm so cocky, I got the upper hand
you won't stop me I knew you'd understand
I'm on off a molly
sippin' on gin magnum thin in my wallet
tryin' to get some pussy and nah I ain't ashamed

chillin' and I'm noticin' these bitches really changed
feelin like they focus to get closer to the fame
