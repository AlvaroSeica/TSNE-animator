God damn it wont end
Beats bars and pens its all a young cunt kens
So I go and get it writ
Its ok but I still aint making shit
Too bad its on them
I dae what I dae all day so fuck friends
So I tell them what it is
Listen up its the Scottish remix

[Werd]
I'm no flashy flash
I'm no splashy splash 
I need picked up like a taxi cab
And I tax you raj 
I will gladly have
All your shit from your kicks to your bag and cash
I take your hash n smoke
I take a massive toke
Inhale exhale yes I'm that dope
Yes I'm that bloke but I'm still broke
I need money money money honeys E's and coke
Your crew I move through
I cut fucking dicks man you knew it was due
Kind of like you was Jews
And I put your whole crew on the deck just like a cruise
Oh Deek we killing them
Now check the dip in them
Gripping on tracks and roll past like Michelin
Its your boys make noise we just spitting ken
Hating on the voice your choice why listen then

[Werd]
God damn it wont end
Beats bars and pens its all a young cunt kens
So I go and get it writ
Its ok but I still aint making shit
Too bad its on them
I dae what I dae all day so fuck friends
So I tell them what it is
Listen up its the Scottish remix

[Werd]
I am no fucking joking
I will fucking cut him open 
I am dope and I am potent 
Like the dope that I am token
Yeah I'm no stopping
I'm on fire I am smoking
So feel it like your groping chick-a-chick my motion
I am coasting like the ocean
I am floating like I'm boating
And you other rappers sink Dont think I am boasting
Cause I'm hot I am roasting
And your not you are frozen
See I'm first class mate like the CDs that am posting
It my rain you are soaking
Used to sleep now your woken
Cause I went up in the lab and I went and made a potion
Plus yes I am ghosting
I write I am chosen
I do production cutting I am fucking putting most in
I amaze you get lost in
I get play thats the notion
I sneak right into the scene call me Trojan
Need cream like lotion
My dreams keep growing
So like I got skins and things I keep rolling

[Werd]
God damn it wont end
Beats bars and pens its all a young cunt kens
So I go and get it writ
Its ok but I still aint making shit
Too bad its on them
I dae what I dae all day so fuck friends
So I tell them what it is
