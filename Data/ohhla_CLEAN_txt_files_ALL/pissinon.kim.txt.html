[Intro]
New! Lil' Kim
It's called Pissin On Em
You know what we doin here
Let's go Big Mike

[Chorus: Lil' Kim]
Shitted on 'em, I'm just pissin on 'em
Spittin on 'em
Put-put-put-put your middle fingers in the air
if you did it on 'em
Shitted on 'em, I'm just pissin on 'em
Spittin on 'em
Put-put-put-put your middle fingers in the air
if you did it on 'em

[Lil' Kim]
I just shitted on 'em
All these bitches is my pets
I keep a tight leash around thy necks
Bitches try to bite, take they ass to the vet
Put em right to sleep like they popped a Xanax
Uhhhh~! Ye-ye-ye-yeaaah, I be shittin on 'em
{*hachs loogie*} Spittin on 'em
Kimmy go in, I go extra hard
I swipe your whole life with my debit card

[Chorus]

[Lil' Kim]
The Lamborghini turns into Megatron
Got 'em blue in the face, A-A-Avatar
I be shittin on 'em, diarrhea
You bitches looking burnt, gonorrhea
Same bitches throwin shots, but tryin to be her
I guess it's all politics, Condolessa
I'm the first lady, her majesty
Ra-ra-rap's royalty bitch, now you work for me

[Chorus]

[Lil' Kim]
All you clones had your shine like cubic stones
Now the show is over, Jenny Jones
Toss 'em in the +Lake+ like +Ricki+ bitch
And I stay on this money, like a pyramid
Yeah, I've been about a check hoe
You stole your whole swag, you worse than a klepto
I just blow 'em kisses, X and O
Got 'em sick to they stomach, Pe-Pe-Pe-Pepto
All you bitches is some bums
I fill your cup up with change
You hoes should be rappin on the #4 train
The price of your mother's house I paid for my Range
Uhh~! And that's an auto-biography
I swear these hoes be obsessed how they copy me
Laxative flow, I'm shittin on 'em constantly
And I leave a stain like I ain't wipe my ass properly
Eww!</pre>
