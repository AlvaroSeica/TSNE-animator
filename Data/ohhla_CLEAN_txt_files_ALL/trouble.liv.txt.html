(Tr-tr-trouble on my mind *scratching*)

[Verse 1: Majesty](Stretch)
People see me, some say I never heard of ya
(He's a YG, hes a cold stone murderahh)
My life is hectic, cuz my town is hot
All the dirt we did, like when we ran up in the spot
House of shit, niggas dead on arrival
(Life is point blank the deadly game of survival)
My Moms crying every day, always have to give in
Saying get a job (but we pump for a living)
Every other day she be screaming on me
We love our mother to death, (but motherfuck a J-O-B)
I never worked in my life, I've been robbing since 14
When we was growing, everybody had a loot scheme
When we was young, we never wished to be a cop
A doctor or a lawyer, we was always on the block
Stopped boning hoes, all the real bitches teased
Since we real, we moved up, moving keys with these
(Now were generals, we real niggas) Fronting the past
Jealous going on, cuz we got the bitches and the stash
We're the type of niggas that'll bust you and shank ya
The crew will do the same cuz we not no fake gangstas
Never going poor, cuz thats just a diss
If we need some extra loot we'll scratch a chump off the shit list
Anything, anybody, even do bitches
Our specialty is snitches, cuz snitches lay in ditches
Our attitude is ill, I wish our light would shine
And get these flash backs from off my mind

[Verse 2: Stretch]
Now what the Squad's tryin to tell ya is that were stars but were hoodlums
Large crew niggas wanna move but were doin em
Wreckin shit, constantly moving with the roughnecks
Growing up harder than life, in the projects
Problems always linger so I'm fed cuz were stressed out
Alot of shit done happen with our folks so we camp out
But niggas know the flavor, regardless
Step and feel the motherfucking wrath of the heartless
Damn, trouble on my mind, every other time mother fuck it
Cuz I'll never kick the bucket
Trouble on my mind, every other time mother fuck it
Cuz I'll never kick the bucket

(Tr-tr-trouble on my mind, tr-tr-trouble on my mind, trouble on my mind, mind)</pre>
