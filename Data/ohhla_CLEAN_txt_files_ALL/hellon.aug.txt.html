Song:   Hell On Earth
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I'm a young nigga who just lived life
I done seen so much shit just from the very bottom

So it was always about just grinding and getting it out tha mud fa me

I just want a nigga to know what I thought

I got an opportunity
It's way bigger than me

Cause you know God put nigga in a position
For a reason

I was d-block in the street life
Was on my grind so I didn't sleep nights
Used to push rocks out on my block
Saw police lights, I heard the gunshots
I had nowhere to go
At the end of the road
Had to do something fast
Now I ain't running no more

Cause I found the light at the end of the tunnel
That's why I kept my head high
Instead of sealing my faith
Sitting here wishing I would die
Living in hell on earth
Dead last so I couldn't see first
But I knew it wouldn't get worst
So it only got better (better)
And it's getting better
Living in hell on earth
Dead last so I couldn't see first
But I know it wouldn't get worst
So it only got better (better)
And it's getting better

Cause I knew one day that life would get better
Finally made a way so now it's all better
Cause I knew one day that life would get better
Finally made a way so now it's all better</pre>
