[Hook]
*scratches* "Back on the scene is the incredible One Man"
*scratches* "Army" *scratches* "Army"
*scratches* "Back on the scene is the incredible One Man"
*scratches* "Army" *scratches*

[Bridge]
With the eagle, I begin, spread wings, ride the wind
My story will never end, I probably used a million pens
Hundreds of rhymes I was anxious to bus'
Now-a-days, what I touch, don't need the paper as much
Still sharper than the knife that Cane was able to clutch
You permanently scarred from a Subterraneous cut
You only get honest expression when I spit in your ear
That means even when I'm dissing you I'm being sincere
That means even when I'm dissing you I'm being sincere
That means, that means, that means, that means...

[Verse One]
Don't need a major, indie cars drive me
Highly effective 'cause my crew selected never take the cause likely
Get inspiration from the All Mighty
I pray "Allah, guide me"
Even underground cats be all shiesty
False grimy wack emcees need to floss nightly
'Cause they never seen as raw like me so their jaws bite me [ouch]
Check me now, corner-back style
Everytime they pass the microphone you would think I was a moss viking
My style touch-down, your style need a touch-up
Even with a Rick James sample you couldn't touch SUB [you can't touch this]
Wack emcees wanna act stuck-up when you kick it with 'em
Thinkin' I'm dissin' 'cause I ain't feelin' the shit they spittin'
Know the difference between dissin' and constructive criticism
They should try to pen-a-written that can fit-the-rhythm
Too busy tryin' to hit the ism, hit the women
Feminine get the Benjamin's, watch my SUB-Zero
finish 'em, finish 'em, finish 'em, finish 'em...

[Hook]

"Uh, I'd like to say something about that"

[Verse Two]
We don't procrastinate, how many times I got to say to you?
We ain't the type of cats that only talk about what they would do
For years we've been paying dues, staying true
To our self, while we making moves, thank God we made it through
Won't stop until I do what I came to do
Kick a flow and get the doe, that's just to name a few
Now every rhyme I say to you is here to stay with you
We stick in your head like it was said with the crazy glue
You wanna battle? One Be Lo is not afraid of you
I could care less about your reputation, even though it maybe true
The truth is Subterraneous your favourite crew
And all them non-believing cats that came with you can catch the vapors too
I rock their minds like the slingshot of David do, liver than Pay-Per-View
You couch potatoes don't believe me? call the cable crew
Everytime I bus' kids think they on their way to school
This grown man ain't got no time to play with you
Theresa didn't raise a fool
Tried to play me Glenn Close, nah, we can't be cool
'Cause I'll be damned if I let it be a Deja Vu

[Bridge]
