[Chorus: Big Moe with Lil' O in parenthesis]
Girl I think I want to slow down cause your the one for me
(I'm tired of being a playa and a balla
 Just gimme one bad bitch so I can spoil her)
And I'ma spoil ya girl, give ya all the world
Cause I can't forget about the thangs ya done for me
(I'm tired of being a playa and a balla
 Just gimme one bad bitch so I can spoil her)
 
[Verse 1: Lil' O]
Four in the mornin and I'm chillin with my late night hype
I just hit but she aint my type
she just another big bootie, nice tits, and a face that's right 
that stay fly in some name brand tights
this gold digga dont love me, she wouldnt there when I was broke
if I fell shed disappear like smoke
I always ask why I even play myself messin round with these jokes
I gotta throwed lil mamma at home, I'm such a fool
and if you seen my gal playa you would know that I'm blessed
with a pretty face and beautiful breasts,
flat stomach, big bootie, bow legged thighs, runnin track legs,
and stay fly from her toes to her hair
plus I know that she loves me, been with me through thick and thin
when I was broke before I got me some ends
through all my in and out of jail, court cases, she a nigga best friend
but I always break her heart in the end, I need to chill cause...
 
[Chorus: Big Moe with Lil' O in parenthesis]
Girl I think I want to slow down cause your the one for me
(I'm tired of being a playa and a balla
 Just gimme one bad bitch so I can spoil her)
And I'ma spoil ya girl, give ya all the world
Cause I can't forget about the thangs ya done for me
(I'm tired of being a playa and a balla
 Just gimme one bad bitch so I can spoil her)
 
[Verse 2: Lil' O]
If I tell her jump she aint gon trip and ask why...
she gon say anything for my king, how high?
I swear I can't recall her ever tellin me a lie
plus she always tell me baby, know I'm down til I die
my gift from the sky, boo I swear I can't believe it
through all our years together boo I know I never cheated
when I didnt have a penny, got me everything I needed
she got her own dough, college courses completed
the Bible I read it, cause she keep me up in church
the type of girl that keep you out of trouble, out of dirt
why you with me, I'm a thug and a flurt, 
Im always in these streets runnin round chasin skirts
but I think I'm growin up now knowing that I played myself
cause when I cheat on you I hate myself, say to myself
if you did it to me...how would I feel, 
I think its time to be a man and keep it real, for real cause....
 
[Chorus: Big Moe with Lil' O in parenthesis]
Girl I think I want to slow down cause your the one for me
(I'm tired of being a playa and a balla
 Just gimme one bad bitch so I can spoil her)
And I'ma spoil ya girl, give ya all the world
Cause I can't forget about the thangs ya done for me
(I'm tired of being a playa and a balla
 Just gimme one bad bitch so I can spoil her)
 
[Verse 3: Lil' O]
You gon get alot of ice, alot cars, alot of luxury
cause you didnt have to fuck with me
even though I was three time felon you still stuck with me
and when I tripped you put up with me
so I'm thinking thats its time I paid you back for what you did
Im thinkin that its time I made you wife and gave you kids
Im thinkin I should put you in a house on a hill
and I know I aint a trick cause you deserve it cause you real
and baby I'ma treat you like a queen, wine and dine on marble floors
keep you in the mall so you can shine on these hoes
take you round the world, one day China, one day Rome,
be a better man so we can have a happy home
beautiful, brown skin, straight pearl white teeth
body smooth and soft smellin so sweet,
every time ya walk by in ya g-string ya put me in heat
you and some kids make my vision complete and thats for real cause...
 
[Chorus: Big Moe with Lil' O in parenthesis]
Girl I think I want to slow down cause your the one for me
(I'm tired of being a playa and a balla
 Just gimme one bad bitch so I can spoil her)
And I'ma spoil ya girl, give ya all the world
Cause I can't forget about the thangs ya done for me
(I'm tired of being a playa and a balla
 Just gimme one bad bitch so I can spoil her)
