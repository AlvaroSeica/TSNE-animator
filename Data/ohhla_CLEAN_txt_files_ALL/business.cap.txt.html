For real, for real...
yo, this is based on a true story, from a Man that lost land...

Verse 1: (Cappadonna)

I'm goin' all out, I love trout 
Black is what I be about
95-south all the way up, I tear mics up
peep the conduct, wherever lightning struck
tear the jail up, truck with the mind food 
truck with jewels, forget babylon rules
I'm crusin' with the angels
goin' through Parkhill, let the Gods build and all of that
graduation hats, bigger stacks
ya'll hardly ever seen besides cream
I got the vaccine for ya'll uncle Tom rappers
I told ya'll before to be easy, Devils attackin' is practice
provocative songs, yeah It's Donna, don't even panic
hold ya'll like the Atlantic
Pillage at your service 
clubs start to get nervous
loose lips, it's like emptyin' clips
packed with the info, join the revolution
slang prostitution, even if you boostin'
play it like you still chill, homicide hill from the other side
my Mother sighed, strugglin, poor and tired
a Baby that never cried, a family that never died
I see everything from the outside. 

Chorus - 

O.T.F. and The Pillage, we all comin' through
watch your back nigga, and your girl watch it too
'cause we conduct big business, raw is how we give this
live this, thats how we conduct big business
O.T.F. and The Pillage, hide your shine nigga
when we come through, might have to jump on you
'cause we conduct big business, raw is how we live this
give this, thats how we conduct big business. 

Verse 2: (Shyhiem)

I ride shotgun in Cappa's Black ML Four-Twenty
Benz Jeep with big boy heat, a Thirty-Thirty
shotgun, pull it out and show you what a thug about
ya'll niggas is pussy, thats why ya'll get atein' out
niggas hate me now 'cause I be so jig my A.K.A. oughta be Shawn Carter
my heart bigger than my ego, eho
I put my heart on the line and hit both free throws
yeah, build with a parole hole
guzzle the old Gold with no bag, on the bliddock
holdin' the gliddock, you can't fuck with this shit ock
locks it down like JT from the mothafuckin' liddot
S is for my Sons, H I'm not havin' it 'cause I'm not the one
A is for the ammo that I keep for my gidd-uns
B is for the blood, bandanas, and the bidd-uns
C is for the crips, comrads, and the Kenyon
we a-alike, b-alike, so we see alike
I roll with niggas that stay in jail like Iron Mike
I get hype, and keep it gully, interrupt commercial shit. 

Chorus 

Verse 3: (Cappadonna)

God, keep shinin' your light, I got a calling
felt like the Angels were fallin'
but with this God given mic I restored the faith
my love for the prophets keeps me safe
see, I don't have to worry 'cause I know God is great
if it wasn't for the Father it wouldn't be a Bill Gates
no Bill Clinton, no United States
peep it, explore my mind like a secret
if the music ain't good, ya'll won't leak it
so I give thanks and praise to the almighty
the spirit in the music hit ya'll lightly
Motown Hip-Hop, don't try to fight me
I call on the arch angel, cast out the hate
all-time Cappacino the great
a role model like Treach and Pepa
Double L, Will Smith and Jada Pinkett
the way I think it, my songs speak to you
you better stay focused and the beast won't eat you.
