[Georgia Anne Muldrow]
Simply a joy to be next to you
Such a thrill, you've got such a good attitude
And though I enjoy my solitude
I'm gettin wise to what the power of two can do
Real love always takes it's victim by surprise
Sneak attack devotion when I look into that black man's eyes
Secrets of the cosmos realign in my spine; it's truly ancient
Deep inside of me he's the only one I ever need
Got no rhythm rhyme and reason in my knees
Senseless sets me free and plants my feet
into a different state of being
Simply a joy to be close to you
Such a thrill, you've got such a good attitude
And though I enjoy my solitude
I'm gettin wise to what the power of two can do
Real love always takes it's victim by surprise
Sneak attack devotion when I look into that black man's eyes
Secrets of the cosmos realign in my spine; it's truly ancient
Deep inside of me he's the only one I ever need
Got no rhythm rhyme and reason in my knees
Senseless sets me free and plants my feet
into a different state of being</pre>
