Song:   Punk Rock Billy
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Punk rock Billy was an average Joe
Kickin kids shins with his steel boot toe
With his chin up high and his feet down low
So no one tells him which way to go
And I don't know just what it will take
Watch and see all of his mistakes
And stumbling onto the ground again
And off to the jail house is where he's sent
He wore his pants too low
He spiked his hair too high
He never said goodbye

That punk rock Billy he's the one
Ain't nobody gonna fuck with me
Knowin they'll end up DEAD
Why the fuck would they call LAPD
Cause you know those dudes can't catch me
Say where I live there's no sunshine
Kickin in heads and your behind
Wanna fuck with me just one more time
Punk rock Billy this is your last time

He wore his pants too low
He spiked his hair too high
He never said goobye
That punk rock Billy he's the one</pre>
