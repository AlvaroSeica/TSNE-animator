[JE &amp; Blaque]
Ooh, ooh
Come on, come on, come on

1 - [JE &amp; Blaque]
    Yo you can always go
    I'm saying yo
    If you ain't with it
    You can split it baby
    Yo forgive me I am not for you
    Gotta let you know
    Baby you can be just like wall
    Just let me know
    And you can go

[Blaque]
Just wanna know why
You don't be here like you're supposed to
Just wanna know why
Do you - and why you drink so much to
Just wanna know why
You can't be what I want you to be
If you want me, oh yeah
(Yo, yo, yo, yo)

[JE &amp; Blaque]
You know, I know
You ain't try-na change so
You go, I go
We ain't gotta stress no more
You know we ain't gotta stress no more

Repeat 1

[Jagged Edge]
Just wanna know why
You always trippin' about what I don't do
(Why you trippin'?)
Just wanna know why
You try-na change me
When you got at me
Don't think that you're better than me
Just cause you don't get down me
Let a man be a man be a man
Or I'mma go, yeah
(Yo, yo, yo, yo)

[JE &amp; Blaque]
You know, I know
You ain't try-na change so
You go, I go
We ain't gotta stress no more
You ain't gotta stress no more
Baby you can go, yeah

Repeat 1

[Jagged Edge]
You say you want me
Baby now I see
That you just wanna change me

[Blaque]
No, you're not what you said you were
So you can get your things and go

[R.O.C.]
We can go bounce, baby bounce, be out
As a matter fact mama wait a minute
(Hold up!)
This is my house
So yeah I ain't going no where so pack yours
Have a good life, whoa THAT AIN'T YOURS
Forget it I have another White Amara
Under the covers baby I'm the R.O.C.
Hopefully I'll call ya
Yeah sure please do me a favor
If you gon' leave twist lock the door
And drop the keys, ya know

Repeat 1</pre>
