[Verse One]
Checking out The Wake Up Show and I know
I'm never gonna fit in
The pattern sound the same as the flow and it shows
That no one's really listening
See, all i want to do is be Radiohead
And do something ingenuous
But I get two stars and half instead
In a magazine and it seems hopeless

[Chorus]
look and see what you've done to me
It's just a perfect formality
And if you lock me out, you'll never get the key
It's just a perfect formality
So, I let it go
Let it go, I let it go
I let it go, it doesn't matter to me 
So, I let it go
Let it go, I let it go
I let it go, it doesn't matter to me 

[Verse Two]
Meeting all the hip hop stars and it's weird
I don't pretend to know them
Just noticing who I'll have to eventually kill
I don't intend to show them
See, all I want to do is be number one
And have everyone bow down
Why does it feel like it's so hard to be done
See, I just want to be cooler than you

[Chorus]
Look and see what you've done to me
It's just a perfect formality
And if you lock me out, you'll never get the key
It's just a perfect formality
So, I let it go
Let it go, I let it go
I let it go, it doesn't matter to me 
So, I let it go
Let it go, I let it go
I let it go, it doesn't matter to me</pre>
