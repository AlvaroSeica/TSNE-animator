"Yo. Yo. Yo."

'Cause I'm this, Gorillaz from the mist lyracist and my thoughts be twisted
I spit the wickedest rhymes from a time that's never exsisted
My futuristic linquistics turn fools into statistics
I'm a lyrical misfit with the sadistic characteristics
I perform murderous acts on my tracks with a single breath
and if a boy wanna test, then I be stampin' upon his chest
Done makin' a mess - Not a man could concieve the weed I'm consumin'
and I transform from my cartoon pseudonym, turn to a human
I spit words from my mouth that be turnin' you inside out
and I tie knots in intestines just like I'm a boy scout
that's workin' 'em out - Now rearrangin' your whole skeletal structure
then I find some nine inch nails to perform some accupuncture
When I punch ya, I rupture one of your rib cage in a rage
and I turn you into a cartoon toon and erase the page
I take you back to the stone age with Barney and Fred Flinstone
Got Dino to take a machinos and then forage in a live home

[Life]
I'ma take off like a jet pack with the get back, rather step back
I'ma make the crowd react and nod they heads until they kneck snap
Life conflict rap while riding a skateboard and doin' a tic-tac
and leave your head in a spin like servin' on turn table skid mats
I'm a concrete lion, big cat - These are real talk, not big-chat
Did ya get that 'cause I ain't no small timer - I rhyme on big tracks
Now fell the vise I create - This heavyweight, I'm a rap to detanate
and demonstrate how I generate lyrics that supernaturaly levitate
to the top - My lyrics are skeletons -  Accelerate and leave you panicin'
Take the ground from beneath your feet, leave you Skywalk-in' like Anakin
I'm sharper than the tips of Zulu spears and Olympic javelins
My style is totally buckwild and most definately happenin'
To your brains I be tappin' in, to computers I be hackin' in
To me, I be out of this world like aliens who were time travelin'
I'm babblin' in the Fists of Fury technique when I speak
Forget Karate Kid and these wooden blocks, I chop from concrete
Concrete, concrete, concrete!
Wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-wha!

[Si Phili]
I'be been stoned; ever since the days of creation, I've been red
I'm a mad dred, causin' so much havoc in Russel's head
My lyracism is just like an aneurysm inside his brain
He plays the beat in a trance and he's never feeling no pain
I could never be a racist because I posess so many faces
I'm one of those beat-up bad wit' bags and a pair of braces
with lines longer than laces - I'm gracin' you with my presence
The lyrics went flippin', makin' ya bubble like effervescence
I pulverize and bamboozle, shake numb skulls like a boodle
I smashed the top of your head with a guitar I borrowed from Noodle
I'm as animated as Japanese animes causin' callamities
Some serious savory from my roarous rhymes of reality
At the speed of sound, I'm wanderin' around - The clown done tried to defeat us
without tenacities or audacity - Don't you ever thought you could beat us
Beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us,
beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us,
beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us...</pre>
