All obsessed with the taste of flesh.
(same thing said backwards)
All obsessed with the taste of flesh.
(same thing said backwards)

Even though you think your alone their always everywhere
(pushing me, pulling me, helpin me, guidin me)
I must be insaaannneee, no their always everywhere
(guidin me, helping me, pullin me, pushin me)
futher everyday yeahhhhh their always everywhere

would you feel likeee
(your left alone)
would you get highhhh
(and try to find a zone)
its aallrigghhtt
(your not alone)

(because your not alone)

(some weird whispering)
("all obsessed with the taste of flesh..." backwards)

Even though you think your alone their always everywhere
(pushing me, pulling me, helpin me, guidin me)
I must be insaaannneee, no their always everywhere
(guidin me, helping me, pullin me, pushin me)

(some weird whispering)
("all obsessed with the taste of flesh..." backwards)

Even though you think your alone their always everywhere
(pushing me, pulling me, helpin me, guidin me)
