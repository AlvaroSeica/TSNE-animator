[Intro: Babyface Fensta (Lee-Major)]
(Fuck ya'll, I clap parties like '85, baby) Rocking kangols and shit
(Yo, yo, give me some fucking elbow room)

[Chorus 2X: Lee-Major (Q-Plex)]
(Slamdance, slamdance, slamdance, slamdance, slam!)
Do you understand what hip hop's about? (slamdance!)
Until you can knock that man out (slamdance!)
Until you get all that stress out, just (slamdance! slamdance, slam!)
Do you understand what hip hop's about? (slamdance!)
Until you can knock that man out (slamdance!)
Until you get all that stress out, just (slamdance! slamdance, slam!)

[Babyface Fensta]
I'm the God in Zilla, the King of Kong
My song's the bomb, nuclear reactor
I'm radioactive, a 'bad boy'
I'm 'so so def', my skills ain't got 'no limit'
(Movin' on your left) I scream it 'loud'
My girl's 'elektra', deadly assassin
Leave you stranded on 'death row', yo
My darts be 'razor sharp', 'profile' the celebrity
Kill a M.C., my first 'priority'
Got a 'def jam', leave you mute, the 'aftermath'
Televise me on 'Sony', I came to 'warn a brother'
'Cold chilling', and 'living large', let's go on a cruise
Dump you in the 'Atlantic', in a 'sleeping bag'
Since you like to brag, dance to the drummer's beat

[Chorus]

[Babyface Fensta]
I make you famous, my flavor is spice
Understand this knowledge, they cool as ice
I get cream illegal, fuck a regal beagle
Rock Clarks before Starks, I'm New York hot tracks
'Roc' you 'fella', 'boy' you 'bad'
Black bag that trash, rock a doo-rag
Don't let my pants sag, I take you back like suede fronts
Roscoe jeans, nylon BVD's, kick it to a chick, yo shorty, don't be so mean
I kiss Jada, you sweet me, who fucking with this
They reminisce over you, invite me to a duel
'Filter' your cypher, 'evil resident', enter my Tekken tournament
(Go head, go head, go head, go head)

[Hook 2X: Babyface Fensta]
I make you (hip hop), til it drop, who get the props
Don't stop (get it, get it)
Fellas say (ho), ladies say (oww)
How many M.C.'s get disgraced, before they tell you don't fuck with Face

[Chorus]</pre>
