[Verse 1: Christina]
Hmmmmm
So, what am I not 'sposed to have an opinion?
Should I be quiet just because I'm a woman?
Call me a bitch because I speak what's on my mind
Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled

When a female fires back
Suddenly the target don't know how to act
So he does what any little boy will do
Making up a few false rumors or two

That for sure is not a man to me
Slanderin' names for popularity
It's sad you only get your fame through controversy
But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say

[Chorus: Christina]
This is for my girls all around the world
Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth
Thinkin' all woman should be seen not heard
So what do we do girls? Shout louder
Lettin' 'em know we're gonna stand our ground
Lift your hands high and wave them proud
Take a deep breathe and say it loud
Never can, never will, can't hold us down

Nobody can hold us down, nobody can hold us down
Nobody gonna hold us down, never can, never will

[Verse 2: Christina]
So, what am I not 'sposed to say what I'm sayin'?
Are you offended with the message I'm bringin'?
Call me whatever 'cause your words don't mean a thing
Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing

If you look back in history
It's a common double standard of society
The guy gets all the glory, the more he can score
While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore

I don't understand why it's okay
The guy can get away with it, the girl gets named
All my ladies come together and make a change
And start a new beginning for us, everybody sing

[Chorus: Christina (Lil' Kim)]
This is for my girls all around the world (Yeah)
Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth
Thinkin' all woman should be seen not heard
(You can't get rid of us)
So what do we do girls? Shout louder
Lettin' 'em know we're gonna stand our ground
(We standin' our ground on this one)
Lift your hands high and wave them proud
Take a deep breathe and say it loud
Never can, never will, can't hold us down (Check it)

[Verse 3: Lil' Kim]
Here's something I just can't understand
If a guy have three girls than he's the man
He can even give her some head, then sex her raw
If a girl do the same than she's a whore
But the tables 'bout to turn, I bet my fame on it
Cats take my ideas and put they name on it
It's aiight though, you can't hold me down
I got to keep on movin'
To all my girls with a man who be tryna mack
Do it right back to him and let that be that
You need to let him know that his game is whack
And Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera gotcha back

[Bridge: Christina]
You're just a little boy, you think you're so cute, so coy
You must talk so big, to make up for smaller things
Said you're just a little boy, all you do is annoy
You must talk so big, to make up for smaller things
This is for my girls

[Chorus: Christina]
This is for my girls all around the world
When you come across a man that don't respect your word
Thinkin' all woman should be seen not heard
So what do we do girls? Shout louder
Lettin' 'em know we're gonna stand our ground
So put your hands high and wave 'em 'round
Take a deep breathe and say it loud
Never can, never will, can't hold us down

This is for my girls all around the world
When you come across a man that don't respect your word
Thinkin' all woman should be seen not heard
So what do we do girls? Shout louder
Lettin' 'em know we're gonna stand our ground
So put your hands high and wave 'em 'round
Take a deep breathe and say it loud
Never can, never will, can't hold us down

[Breakdown: Christina (Lil' Kim)]
(Uh, ayo ayo, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
Spread the word (Can't hold us down, c'mon, uh)
Yeah we here, we back again, yeah
Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera
Yeah (Can't hold us down, uh)</pre>
