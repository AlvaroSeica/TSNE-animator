[Steve Knight]
Tryin' to take me back away
Take me back on down
There's nobody left to save in this town
I keep runnin' away
I keep runnin', runnin' away

[Piper]
As long as I remember, been fightin' for my freedom
Staying up, reading, searching for a way to beat 'em
I'm a soldier. Bullshit Â– I don't really need it
I used to stay weeded, now I'm standing undefeated
You know I love my people. I write a fucking thesis
On how we struggle and survive, but you won't read it
And by the all of my people come from different races
And come from different nations. They die for education
All of my people fill the streets, they're scared of opposition
My people take the country back from all you greedy bitches
My people chop your head off for pimpin' little sisters
My people know how to shut the fuck up and listen
My people plannin' when, my people must prevail
Some of my people cops, some of them locked in jail
They all know the real, so you could keep the trash
And take your propaganda, and shove it up your ass

[Steve Knight]
Tryin' to take me back away
Take me back on down
There's nobody left to save in this town
They've been tryin' to shoot me down
Ohh, I keep runnin' away
I keep runnin', runnin' away

[Piper]
My people never run, unless they run for cover
And then return fire, until your ass smothered
My people never bluffin', they know that life is real
My people keep their word; it's worth a hundred mill
Ain't no way you gon' survive when all my people strong
They try to bury us alive, but we made it home
It's time to kill Bill; I sharpened all my weapons
I kissed the wife and kids. I'm talking to the reverend.
I got two brothers sitting on their ass up in heaven.
I cuss them both out every day, cause neither one is helping.
My people working hard, or looking for a job.
My people go to school. My people getting robbed.
By the credit cards, thugs, and the greedy system.
My people tried to play it cool, 'till the rules bit 'em.
So welcome to the end, unless you let us in.
This is the age of truth. The phoenix flies again.

[Steve Knight]
Tryin' to take me back away
Take me back on down
There's nobody left to save in this town
They've been tryin' to shoot us down
Ohh, I keep runnin' away
I keep runnin', runnin' away

Tryin' to take me back away
Take me back on down
There's nobody left to save in this town
They've been tryin' to shoot me down
Ohh, I keep runnin' away
I keep runnin', runnin' away

Tryin' to take me back away
Take me back on down
There's nobody left to save in this town
They've been tryin' to shoot me down
Ohh, I keep runnin' away
I keep runnin', runnin' away</pre>
