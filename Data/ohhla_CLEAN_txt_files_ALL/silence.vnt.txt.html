[Verse 1]
It's the runaway refugee
the renegade, yep guess who - me
Fuck you, the prayer never rescued me
Load up the mic yep check two-three
Never gave a fuck about an SUV
Late awake 12 past dawn
Watching the sky light up like a Belfast car bomb
Mask on, gasoline ready to burn
Disecting the world while it turn
See, mad disorder crossing the border
meet your fate
We filled with more hate than our love for life
Wanna hitch-hike cross the continent 
and police got a problem with
Vents stomping the pavement
Smashing a freeway to bits, rebuild a nation
From the fragments of routine
who be killing those kids to get that cream

[Chorus]
Let it all out
Let it all out, Let it all out, Let it all out
Let it all out, Let it all out
Another 4 years where I can pretend to get free
Let it all out
Let it all out, Let it all out, Let it all out
Let it all out
Don't wanna pay for nobody to represent me

[Verse 2]
Get a paint of dye, scene pittiful
Terrorist war criminal, rush shit 
tearing up land for the mineral
Kill 'em all, God's sorting out Vents
Walk about with a nunchuck
life coming unstuck
Time slipping like "What the fuck?"
dis me, got you raging locked in a guillotine
Nicoteen stained hairs make flairs to kick the pipe
One-fifth grip the mic
Spark the match that light the flame
Trials pour the gas we design the same
Mind insane, Certified break your god damn law
but the law don't feel no pain
Dad said to go get paid
Working 6 days for a fraction of what he just made
They said a poor mans heart is a garden
Ain't much good when you starving

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
We can let it all out
Fall out the top floor
Fuck them, you ain't another brick in the wall
I free fall, splatter them sick of it all
You got a gut but the bigger the sack the bigger the ball
The bigger the pick the bigger the fall, tonight 
sleep depreived walking the path, a long night
With flakes of white
Takes the prize like Christ with the wine and the fishes
Mind of malicious misfits minding their business
Stretch-coat line with improvise, suffice to rip this
place apart like Kandahar
Mad bizarre, kicking that Vandaler
We the laid to brick for a city that keep you working
mad-cheap, talking in your sleep
Dreaming till it's time you laugh 
I throw the first God damn brick when push come to shove

[Chorus]</pre>
