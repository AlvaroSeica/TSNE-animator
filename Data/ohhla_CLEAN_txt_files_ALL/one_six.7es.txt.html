"Ladies and gentlemen" .. "it's about that time"
"Put your-your-your-your hands together"
"We bout to bring him out!"

[Esoteric]
Yo, I'ma read it to y'all, like it was read to me
We the was, the is, and the end to be
7-L, E-S!  A new era, for rap terror
Turn me up Ray, yo..

Cats say they strapped like they ready to blast
Realistically they strapped, meaning needing some cash
Claim you wet, fourth element to keep it real
But when I spit ill you feel like a fifth wheel
I rip steel, kids peeled like burnt skin
Many tried to copy Esoteric but weren't him
Somethin bout the way I use breaks and loops
Take steaks, make 'em into boots
Break up groups like cash issues
Tomahawk cruise missiles rip through your tissue, endin your life
Dem is some nice flowers that I'm sendin your wife
Attemptin to fight, point is like a bendable knife
Comin at me sideways, at the (?)
That's how crabs move, bad move
I am hip-hop, so if I ever bite a line
I'm only takin back what's rightfully mine, motherfucker!

Just a little taste, so strap on that neck brace
One-six.. yo, 7L
