(Verse 1, Lord Infamous)
Let me just take you somewhere secret
Gonna cut all of da lights down dim, forget all
About the world, we gonna just flow wit what we feel, let's share all
You're private thoughts, I'm not just
Out for your sex, let me simp-
-Lify the things in life that
You find complex, forget what
You heard bout me, cause you're a
Scarecrow groupie, but there's no
Pressure on you, cause you know
What you must do, check this out
Let's have a drink and I'll give
You time to think, let me puff
This Buddha blunt, and cut on
This porno bump, girl come lounge
Here by my side, tonight you're
My devil's bride, and as a
Freak deep inside, have no shame
No need to hide, why do you
Keep on blushing it-it off
Like a slut, she-she must be
Kind of tipsy on this Chrystal like a gypsy
Now I got
Her on all fours, bout to break
Down the head-board, crash this broad
On through the wall, now she houlin' like a dog
Sweat poured
We hit the floor it don't quit
Another one lit
She just another victim of Lord Infamous
Late night tip...

(Hook, Lord Infamous &amp; [Gangsta Boo]) 
I'm not the type that get involved in long relationships [Why?]
Takin trips and buyin gifts, I'm sorry I'm not on that tip [What?]
If you want romance, you should just think who you already with [Okay]
If you in that mood, you can just hit me on that "Late night tip" [Ohhh]

(Verse 2, DJ Paul)
I done seen
Some funny (Shhh)
Since I got in this game
Bitch wants my kid
Bitch wants my crib
Since I done gots my fame
I never recalled you askin' yo baby daddy for nathin'
But now my red, Viper on chrome, got ya aggrivated

(Gangsta Boo)
I need a coach bag

(DJ Paul)
I can't be even doin it

(Gangsta Boo)
I need my hair done

(DJ Paul)
Me too, I ain't got nothin to do wit' it
I been through wit it, you n' it
Since the first time ya asked
And might I add
Playas like me can't be savin you rags

(Gangsta Boo)
I ain't wit that non-sense
Or that lovey-dovey mess
Feelin' kinda freaky
Late night callin' cause you got the best
Slip on Victoria Secrets
Hit the liquor store before it close
Call Chris so I can get something white to throw up in my nose
Now I'm feelin fine
Freakin you out is on my mind
Let me get up on yo "Pony"
Like yo name was Ginuwine
Got'chu caught up in the mix
Trippin cause my love's the shit
Late night tip is all we had
Nothing else, so boy that's it (That's it)

(Verse 3, Juicy J)
I can't understand why these broads be trippin
Can't stand the heat? Get outta the kitchen
Ballin in my Lex' dropped high off the ground
Just a young playa, tryin'a put my bid in
Freaks want a man that be constantly payin
Not a ghetto thug, that be constantly layin
Rainbow Inn, or the summer hotel
Oh well, that's where the Juice man stayin
Gotta have a lady that wanna do what I do
Like skippin work, all up in high school
Several other playas in the Three 6 Mafia
Camcordin' hoes skinny dippin in the swimmin pool
Never try to bother you, argue or fight
Keep a pack jimmy-hats, strapped on real tight
Feel the Alizae, or a tall can of Bud Light
Just for a freak, on the moon-light, late night

(Verse 4, Koopsta Knicca)
Tell me, Three 6
Who's that bumpin that music?
Hypnotize and Koop party
Yoo-hoo, I'm bout to lose it
Could we be that late night, crew type
Tears inside our body
Always kinda lonely
Someone want me, hold me
I said, come near, come near
Come hear the Koopsta cryin tears
I can't think positive
When no-one cares of how I feel
Relax my mind, so tight that I ain't even tryin 'ta fight
I can-not lie, though I can ride high, late night
