Everybody's constipated somethings gotta give

[D-Loc]
This situations so frustrating I just wanna say

[Daddy X]
The world just keeps on spinnin (spinnin)

Let me out (no escape) let me out (no escape) let me out (no escape) let me out......
Let me out (no escape) let me out (no escape) let me out (no escape) let me out

[Daddy X]
Southern california hardcore (back up in that ass) we aint gonna warn ya (KMK mob)
Stoners Reakin Havoc who wants next? get them l-o-c snap they necks, what?!?

[D-Loc]
Who wanna step to this rip-hop shit?
Aint nobody fuckin with this punk rock shit
Nowadays its like its getting colder from the kids
What happened to the music in the old school rips?
That O.G. O.C. give a fuck bitch
D.I. and downs toke-a-town klick
No escapin in this mob put it down
Watch the crowd bleed for these kids from P-Town

[J-Ric]
Yo, I feel trapped like theres no way out
Stuck in a rut goin in circles round and round
No one to turn to nowhere to hide
No escape from this place i've been sent to die
I aint going out like this eat a dick
No walls to hold me im breakin out of this shit
One last ditched effort all I got left so, catch me?
You can't stop this plus you're runnin out of breath OOHHH!!!

[Daddy X]
I've been sent from the highest powers
Self destroyer blip then devour
Rip-n-tear til my final hour, theres no escape from the watchful towers
Born free into critical condition, enemy of the state by my own admission
No escape no time for submission, see things clear from my red eye vision
(theres no escape) it's like a prison on its darkest day
(no escape) incarcerate your mind til theres no escape. GO!

Let me out (no escape) let me out (no escape) let me out (no escape) let me out
Well I know (theres no escape) about trees (theres no escape)
Smell like (theres no escape) well I see (theres no escape)
Well I know (theres no escape) about trees (theres no escape)
Smell like (theres no escape) well I see (theres no escape).....theres no escape
