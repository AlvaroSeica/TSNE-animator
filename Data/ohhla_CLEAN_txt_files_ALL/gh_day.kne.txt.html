D. Marshall
Chorus: Just another ghetto day
Another soldier died today
I'm praying that the clips in my AK
You know we gotta ride today (X2)

Kane: I just got word that they shot my Nigga
Sit down on the curb and pray its not my Nigga
If It's Tru, you know what we gots to do
Wrap the glocks in the chopper
Cowards gone get they issue
Cause
Aint no respect for life where I live
Niggas will get revenge
But they wont forgive
Retaliation gone happen in New Orleans
We send that ass to the morgue
Time to donate them organs
They ain't gone care if lil folks or
Ol' folks out there
And as if my standards
Gone be down
When that gun smoke clear
Cause a man a different man with a gun In his hand
Or a bag a dope in his hand
Turn that man to He-man
Roll down the window when we see them Niggas(Damn them niggas)
That be with them niggas
Dont get shook to pull triggas
Put some fire on my gat
Make no eye contact
You busters killed my fuckin nigga
And he never comin back (never)

Chorus (X2)

Abel: I watched yo son throw a rose as They lowered your casket
And God only knows I'm a get this bastard
When he killed you
He killed himself
Straight Drama
I'm a spray even if he standing next to my momma
Remember
We used to chill in the project cuts
Drinking hennesy and smokin till we both Throw up
Your old lady used to fuss
Cause we hang to much
I broke the news 
She hung up
It was just too much
Tellin your momma you was dead
The hardest thing I ever did
So tonite it's mo drama
When I ride for your kid

Chorus (X3)

TRU soldiers gonna ride for you
TRU soldiers gonna ride for you
