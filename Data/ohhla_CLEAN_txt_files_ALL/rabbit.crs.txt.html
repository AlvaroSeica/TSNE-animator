[Ludacris - Verse One]
I be that nigga named Luda
A.K.A. L-O-V-A, L-O-V-A
Fuck that shit, nigga what you wanna say one time
Southside let's ride (say what)
And if you love what you do, do what you feel
Then I know you gonna mark my words
I drop shit like birds
And it's about the time for yo' ass to get served
Just lay it on down, just lay it on down 
While we relax to the tight raps, and the fat tracks
that a nigga Timbaland put down
Oh yes, let's get it on down to the nitty grit
Don't have time for the petty shit
Cause I got mo' diiick, than a lil' bit
And time flies, when I'm havin fun
I can make a hoe get like Forrest Gump and just "run baby run"
I guess that they can't handle this
The brother's just too scandalous
If you don't wanna get freaked,
get up out my way just like in an ambulance (say what)
Gitty up gitty up ride on to the real, lay in death to the fake
And tell your boyfriend just to chill, don't player hate!
Kick back relax and just take off yo' shoes
While I gotta tell you what I wants to do (uh oh)
Yeah

[Timbaland (Crowds) - CHORUS]
Let me touch it (let me touch it)
Let me feel it (let me feel it)
Let me grab it (let me grab it)
That fat rabbit (fat rabbit, fat rabbit, fat rabbit)
Let me touch it (let me touch it)
Let me feel it (let me feel it)
Let me grab it (let me grab it)
That-that rabbit (ohhh, c'mon)
Let me touch it (let me touch it)
Let me feel it (let me feel it)
Let me grab it (let me grab it)
Fat rabbit (fat rabbit, fat rabbit)
Let me touch it (let me touch it)
Let me feel it (let me feel it)
Let me grab it (let me grab it)
That-that fat rabbit (uh oh)

[Ludacris - Verse Two]
Fatter than fat, fat like a dub sack
Showin them where that love's at
So open up yo' eyes, and get a surprise like in Cracker Jacks
Punan' Don happy, givin up that nappy dug out
Get the cut up, then I cut out
Why you standin there wit yo' butt out (whoo)
And it's always in the back of my mind
Whatever the place, whatever the time
Even in College Park after dark I'ma get that sunshine
Closer than close, closer than most, then I'm all up in ya
But beginners give me a thigh, breast, and leg like Mrs. Winter
And let dinner be served
Can I get it on a platter, shatter your bladder
and put so much light in yo' life I'll make the roaches scatter
The wetta the betta, I'm ready to get ya
Gotta have that rabbit like that cheddar
So I can freak you like I just met ya
Hot like a sauna get comfy like in a Cadillac
Nick nack paddy wack, give a dog a bone Jack
Kick back relax and just take off yo' shoes
While I gotta tell you what I wants to do (uh oh)
Yeah

[Timbaland (Crowds) - CHORUS TWO]
Let me touch it (let me touch it)
Let me feel it (let me feel it)
Let me grab it (let me grab it)
That fat rabbit (fat rabbit, fat rabbit, fat rabbit)
Let me touch it (let me touch it)
Let me feel it, girl (let me feel it)
Let me grab it, girl (let me grab it)
That-that rabbit, girl (ohhh, c'mon)
Let me touch it, girl (let me touch it)
Let me feel it, girl (let me feel it)
Let me grab it, girl (let me grab it)
Fat rabbit, girl (fat rabbit, fat rabbit)
Let me touch it, girl (let me touch it)
Let me feel it, girl (let me feel it)
Let me grab it, girl (let me grab it)
That-that fat rabbit, girl (uh oh)

[Ludacris - Verse Three]
Yo' love is supa-cala-fragalistic
You don't know how bad I missed it
If it broke then don't fix it
Yo stuff is butta like a biscuit
Reminisce like Mary, I gotta pop that cherry
Kinda like that coochie, you wanna be my hoochie?
Better than my adversary
Don't be so scary
I, never thought that you could act up
Make a nigga wanna back up
Keep it tight through the night while I wet this track up
So we can slip and slide, make you wanna dip and dive
Trippin while we rip and ride, 'til I get you to cum inside
Got you where I want yo' ass
In the case of an emergency, break the glass
Keep yo eyes on the present and erase the past
And be happy if we got mo' blunts to pass
Get done up and run up
in the guts 'til yo' butt don't shake like it used to
I wake 'em up like a rooster
Take it slow, not faster than a turbo booster
No worry, no hurry - no pain, no gain
Better keep yo' eyes on strain
Cause ain't a damn thing changed, mayn
Sit back, relax and just take off yo shoes
While I gotta tell you what I wants to do (uh oh)
Yeah

[Repeat CHORUS TWO]

[Crowds] 
Let me touch it, let me touch it
Let me feel it, let me feel it
Let me grab it, let me grab it
Fat rabbit, fat rabbit
(repeat x4)

[Timbaland]

West Coast, feel me
Dirty South, can y'all really feel me
East Coast, feel me
West Coast, feel me
Dirty South, (uh huh) can y'all really feel me
East Coast, feel me
West Coast</pre>
