Jag känner att jag faller ("I feel that I'm falling.")
Jag känner att jag faller
Jag känner att jag faller (*Distorted*)

[Chorus: Yukimi Nagano]
If ya don't know me by now
If ya don't know me by now
If ya don't know me by now
If ya don't know me by now
You will never know...
If ya don't...
If ya don't...

[Big Boi]
When I think back, I'm glad I lived it all...
The pain when I'm thinkin' about it, Dad
I will not fall...even tired and all
Grandmamas, great Grandmama, they gone
My daddy's gone

[Chorus: Yukimi Nagano] + (Big Boi)
If ya don't know me by now
If ya don't know me by now (I'm tryin' to breath, but I know my daddy gone)
If ya don't know me by now
If ya don't know me by now
You will never know...
If ya don't...
If ya don't...

[Yukimi Nagano] + (Big Boi)
(Yo...yo)
Hey, even with a storm to face, I still stand tall
I take beyond...the city I was born and raised
Lights...lights turn off, runnin' along my own way
My body lift up...even when I go stray
By now, you should know us
If ya don't know me by now
If ya don't know me by now

[Chorus: Yukimi Nagano]
If ya don't know me by now
If ya don't know me by now
If ya don't know me by now
If ya don't know me by now
You will never know...
If ya don't...
If ya don't...

[Big Boi] + (Yukimi Nagano)
From the bottom of my chest to my stomach
God damn it, my daddy is gone
My daddy's gone...
(? of my heart, of the waves that rock, I listen for you
I'm listenin' through)

[Chorus: Yukimi Nagano] + (Big Boi)
If ya don't know me by now
If ya don't know me by now
If ya don't know me by now
If ya don't know me by now
You will never know...
If ya don't...
If ya don't...

If ya don't know me by now
If ya don't know me by now
If ya don't know me by now
If ya don't know me by now
You will never know...
(If y'all don't know me by now, y'all ain't goin' never know me)
If ya don't...
If ya don't...</pre>
