[Pusha T]
Uh..
Malice found religion, Tony found prison
I'm still tryna find my way up out this fuckin kitchen
A bird's-eye view got me channelling my vision
Turn one to two, now my kilos got a sibling
Father knows best, wash my hands, all's forgiven
We kickin up dust like the colosseum floors
Walls full of safes like they mausoleum doors
Pussy gettin wet, as she walkin through my morgue
Grants', Jacksons', no room for Geoooorge
YEAH~! The Fear of God's in you motherfuckers
This art imitate my life
Your WorldStarHipHop fame based off imitation white
Eliminate the fools ghoulin imitation ice
My music for your soul, inspiration for your life
Every dime made in this life wasn't disastrous
Help my young bitch see her way through the Bachelors'
Sent my old bitch right back to get her Masters'
Same graduation, I was clappin in the rafters
The truth hurts everytime it's revealed
What goes around comes around, this is life's Ferris Wheel (My God...)
Grab hold and reverse the steering wheel
As I parallel park, Kentucky Derby on the grill
The fact that I'm free let's me know God is great
Ten-year marathon of me sellin concentrate
These rappers talk crowns but I'd rather talk fear
Villain like Candyman, say my name and I'll appear
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
Hakuna matata, feet up sippin java
Strollin up the totem poll, what's my only problem?
Scrollin through my Rolodex, who shall bear my toddler?
So many hands raised, as the band plays
I'm here now, watch how many niggaz plans change
...
First class flights, Ciroc-soaked nights
Waking up to models, what a motherfuckin life!</pre>
