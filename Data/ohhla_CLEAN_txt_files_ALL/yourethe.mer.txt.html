(verse one A-Lexxus singing)
see it all happened bout a year ago
we made a promise not to let it go
but now that i got this far
i couldn't help but let it go
i know you know of things in the past
that i felt for you
never let you know whats going on
cause i never really let you hold me this way
but now i'm coming to you honestly
so baby ohhhh

(hook performed by mercedes)
boy you are the oly one
you are the only one for me
finest thing i've ever seen
stay with me
(repeat)

(verse 2 mercedes)
now that you now i have a thing for you
i was wondering if you feel the same way that i do
the feelings that i hold within my heart
lets stay friends forever
and i hope you never part
i hop you know what i feel for you
to spill my heart was what i had to do
keep it true and show me how you make me feel

chorus (this time performed by a-lexus)
