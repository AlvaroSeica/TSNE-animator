Settle down class, take your seats
Pull out the manual and turn to chapter three
We about to learn the lesson on color schemes
You ready? Here we go

OK kids, today we learn the color schemes
Like +purple+ hearts, +black+ clouds, +yellow+ submarines
Can't go wrong if you listen to the song when it's on
Listen to the song, sing along to the 
(colors)

Damn, it's fucked up how they found Tune
He was robbed for his +gold+ chain in front of a +brown+ stone
But what's a fellow to do if he not earning one +red+ cent
Or trying to make the +green+ like mixing +yellow+ with +blue+
Oh no it's true another +black on +black+ cuz it's lynch fly
That's what I heard, word get around like the +pink+ eye
Watch out when your enemies sneak by
Wish I could pour +white+ out
On these lines before the ink dry

OK kids, since now we learning color schemes
From +Red+ Cross, +blue+ shields, +yellow+ submarines
Can't go wrong if you listen to the song when it's on
Listen to the song, sing along to the 
(colors)

Now there's some that's dead from fighting over breadcrumbs
Feet and head numb, it's a murder, we call it +red+ rum
Got them boys in +blue+ with +black+ jacks locking the new youth
They sell +purples+ through +Black+berries with the +Blue+ tooth
Saw this +gold+ digger +red+ bone I knew poising in +Black+ Tail
Another +black+ girl lost inside the world of +Black+ Male
And +white+ collar crime done on the sneak tip
Different from +blue+ collar workers catching the +pink+ slip

Yo red, yellow, orange, green, brown, white, black
Pink, purple, grey, blue, now let us bring it right back
Blue, grey, purple, pink, black, white, brown
Green, orange, yellow, red, now let us break it back down to the
(colors)

I think it's quite foul while I sip the +Grey+ Goose and +orange+ juice
And twist a +white+ riddle in a +White+ Owl
How first you painting the town +red+ beneath the night skies
Now you going to trail telling little +white+ lies
It gives a mother the +blue+s 
To see drama printed in +black+ and +white+ on papers that cover the news
And read some dudes in a +white+ tee was laying in old piss
A victim of a drive-by, they even killed his +gold+fish

OK kids, we done learning color schemes
Using words like +white+ horse, +yellow+ submarine 
Can't go wrong if you listen to the song when it's on
Listen to the song, sing along to the</pre>
