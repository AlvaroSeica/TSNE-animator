Typed by: AZ Lyrics

It's...
It's been a... it's been a second since I seen you
And uh... when I get my own place I guess we're
Gonna kick it again but...
I don't really know
What's right for us cause...
Mateo is tryna...
I mean we're all kinda a mish
We're all that's happened for and I'm not
Saying that...
I'm begging for you back at is

I drop this on our anniversary
Half of your friends ain't even heard of me
They know me as a kid... that's more close than the curtains be
You want me back, well that's working out perfectly
Your lips are just so perfect and it hurts to be the kid that broke your heart
It's not on purpose man
I've done this since the nursery
Do you like me? Well certainly
And if she falls in love
And it's kinda like a curse for me
I don't say this stuff with certainty
I just wanna have fun
There's no need for all the urgency
Cause these ladies always burning me
I'm learning every time that I'm concerned it's an emergency
But girl I'd rather go emergencies
And feel your body cause I know you're been in surgery
Girl it's been a while so now I know that you're sure with me
So come and take my hand
Cause I wanna be the first to be with you

Broken hearts that drown in underwater
Hoping I bring em up to solid ground
Tryna swim ashore but it's getting so much harder
Knowing that the one I love is not around

She's not around
She's not around babe
She's not around
She's not around baby
She's not around
She's not around baby
She's not around
She's not around right now
She's not around

I think I'm liking someone else
But I don't wanna hurt you so I'm right here by myself
And I think that I'm a search you on the social media
Giddy up, straight meeting up
Chilling with your sister
Bout to text, you say I miss you but...
A joker's talking with his fists up
Cause now I got you mad bout them numbers that I picked up
But I ain't even messing with nobody
Chest is heavy, I ain't been confessing to nobody
Man you know they know we broke a thing
Like we see their body
This girl told me, she said texting me's a hobby
And of course Kennedy mad
Man she mad all the time
Like all my enemies mad
She's so mad, she probly tend to be mad
But it's really sad for your oldest friend to be sad
But at least I said all my goodbyes
So she has a bit of closure in the pillow when she cries
But I'm sorry

Broken hearts that drown in underwater
Hoping I bring em up to solid ground
Tryna swim ashore but it's getting so much harder
Knowing that the one I love is not around

She's not around
She's not around babe
She's not around
She's not around baby
She's not around
She's not around baby
She's not around
She's not around right now
She's not around

Tell me if it's too much
Tell me if it's too much
Just tell me if it's too much
Tell me if it's too much
Girl just tell me if it's too much
I got you if it's too much
You can take it off if it's too much
Just tell me if it's too much
We don't gotta do much
Tell me if it's...

If it's too much
Then I'll just hold you and unfold you til I can find the old you
And we were so connected
I probly see so intected, my thoughts are getting so hectic
Words carefully selected
Teens love each other so reckless
I couldn't see where my head is
Is it too much?
Cause if it is we can take our broken hearts right up the stairs
Ignorin all our peers
We hide the fact that we some secret lovers
But we show it all when me under the covers
Baby girl cause...

If it's too much
I got you if it's too much
You can take it off if it's too much
I got you if it's too much, if it's too much

If it's too much I'll put my hand right down your face and make it to your waist
Baby girl cause if it's too much
People have nothing to chase
Only if they have no space
Baby girl cause this is too much
So my lips is what you'll taste
And if it's too much
We gon do it how we did it
Up on zoomer baby girl
But is it...?

Too much
This is too much
Baby is it too much?
Is it too much? Tell me if it's too much
Baby is it too much? Tell me if it's too much
Tell me if it's too much
Tell me if it's too much
Don't be worried when it's too much
Just tell me if it's too much
Tell me if it's too much
Tell me if it's...
Tell me if it's...
Just tell me if it's too much
Tell me if it's...
Cause I got it if it's too much
We can take it if it's...
Girl just tell me if it's too much
Let's spend a couple weeks
So we got it if it's too much
Tell me if it's too much
Tell me if it's...
Girl just tell me if it's too much
Tell me if it's too much
Too much
Girl just tell me if it's too much
It's too much</pre>
