Song:   I'm Beautiful
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Sometimes people say things
that they don't really mean
They just might call you names
to lift their self esteem
But soon enough, they'll realize
that it'll never work
Because inside they're trying to hide
how much they really hurt

But as long as you know who you are
and what you're about
Nothing they say can shake your pride
and make you doubt
The beauty you have in you
and when they give attitude
you can tell them like this

Say, I'm beautiful and spiritual
and I think it's about time to tell you this
I'm gonna be the best me
that I know how to be

One day you learn how much it means
to believe in yourself
So take these words and share these words
to help somebody else

You never know. Anything's possible
You just might make a friend
So when they try to make you cry
tell them again and again

Say it like this- I'm beautiful and spiritual
and I think it's about time to tell you this
I'm gonna be the best me
that I know how to be

Say it again my brother- I'm beautiful
and spiritual and I think it's about time
to tell you this. I'm gonna be the best me
that I know how to be

I'm beautiful and I'm spiritual and I think it's about time to tell you this
I'm gonna be the best me that I know how to be
