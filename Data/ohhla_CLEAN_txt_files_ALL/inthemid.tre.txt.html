[Trey Songz]
Ahhh, mmm mmm, whoahhh, no
If I could be up in the middle of...
Just wanna be in the middle of - middle of your love

If I could be, anywhere in the world
I would be, inside your skirt in you girl
Between your knees - every day of my life, my life, my life
I just want, to make your body really want
to get it on (get it on) we could turn the bed into a stage
and then perform (then perform) your body's gettin hot
Girl I could feel it's warm
I'll show you what I'll do

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
If I could be up in the middle of (middle of your love)
Givin you a little of (like a cup, I'll fill ya)
Just wanna be in the middle of (middle of your love)
Your love, love, love, love

[Trey Songz]
If I could be, believe me girl then I would be yo' fantasy
I'll make you cum right where I be on, top of me
So can we get that close
Where I could fell your body sweat, tryin to make your body wet
Can we (can we?) Climb the mountain top screamin ecstasy (ecstasy)
We so high up in this love, we can reach the peak (reach the peak)
We ain't never comin down
Baby keep makin that sound (if I could just be)

[Chorus]

[Trey Songz]
It's got me open, willing and ready
Baby I'm open, listen up and hear me
I'm not tryin to be, in the front, or the back
By the side, just inside, deep inside
The middle of your love
Ooooooooooooo oooooo OOOH!!
Let me in, let me in the middle

[Chorus] - to fade</pre>
