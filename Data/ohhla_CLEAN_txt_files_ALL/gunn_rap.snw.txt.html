Tek: Yeah nigga, we out here man
Steele: Smif N Wessun ta the death nigga

Tek, [Steele] (both)
[You can be a gangsta] hustler[Pimp or a gun buster
But you're best to have them ones out when the boys come in to rush ya
Thinking cuz you know some thugs them slugs can't touch ya]
Don't be thinkin' cuz they give you pounds and hugs them boys won't fuck ya
[Well let me tell you home boy you got another thing coming
If you think me and my son's gonna spend our whole lives' strugglin'
My dues been paid] And my blocks been bubbling
[And my folks been grumbling, smoke let them know something]
You listening to the flow killer [Ho Hitter] niggas know I'm no quitter 
[You still bitter] and getting sick of [Tek and Steele is them niggas]
[Don't figure] How I miss ya, see how my swagger swigger 
You a five thrower, let me show you I throw one bigger
[Twenty that my Cuz sent ya] You don't want us to come get'cha
[Fuck the ones you brung with ya, hope you brung your ones wit'cha
Ass bent, bet the gun get ya, my life is uncensored
It won't be a pretty picture when them slugs kiss ya]
My dude don't tell em nothing, I want them to start fronting
And let them feel the pressure of the cranium crushing
See the fluid gushing out [That big hole pushing out]
From the body to the sewer, bin needing flushing out

Hook:
[We done been there] and done that
[Put in work] till our ones stack
[Took loses] Got some back
[Smif N Wessun] (is gun rap)
[In the hood] (they love that)
[To the hoods] We give back
Nigga this ain't no come back
[We never left where we live at]

This gorilla's, more iller, [654 wheeler]
[Throw it up] half the block [Red light STOP]
Indo, roll slow [Scream at my kin folk]
Tip over (Hell no) [green light] (Lets GO)
Bank stopper [Crush popper] Still miss [Big Poppa]
For that red Datsun three hot shots at ya
Fo' reala, [Yeah nigga] die in that Chinchilla 
Words of Eazy, Mo skrilla Mo skrilla
[Man you ain't never live
That's the reason I rock fellow, I ain't sign to the Roc-a-fella
I'm just trying to stock up cheddar]
When it's popping on the block only options to pop Beretta's
[Don't stop when the cops can get us, won't stop till my pockets better]
Wear a mask oh, hell no, we blow at the (Po-Po)
Forty caliber, chose for weapons, [That you already know]
That I'm shell-shocked [Up top] family in the Boondocks
[Move rocks it's easy] get your bank stocking, head cocking
Courtesy of me, that you stretch like a T
[Head showing the ivory] we call it the white meat
See how mafias will move, we cement your shows
You riding the current, with the fishes you'll snooze
[We be hustling cuz we gotta] For muscle we got two-shotters
[And the block stand beside us, they know that we true riders
Show love to the hood, and the hood do the same
It don't matter where you go, don't forget where you came]
