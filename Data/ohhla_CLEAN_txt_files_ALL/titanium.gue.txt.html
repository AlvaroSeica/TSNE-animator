Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Sia]
You shout it out; but I can't hear a word you say
I'm talking loud, not saying much
You criticize, but all your bullets ricochet
You shoot me down, but I get up

[Chorus One]
I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away

[Chorus Two]
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium

[Sia]
Cut me down; but it's you who'll have further to fall
Ghost towwwn, and haunted love
Raise your voice; sticks and stones may break my bones
I'm talking loud, not saying much

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]

[Sia]
I am titanium... I am titanium...
Stone hard, machine gun
Firing at the ones who run
Stone hard, blows bulletproof glaassssssss

[Chorus Two] - 2X</pre>
