[Intro/Chorus: Patty Crash]
Diamond life
Sugar baby we dynamite
Playboys and socialites
Young and fly, fly, fly

[Tyga]
19-89 no pressure
But to be the bestest in my section; levels of a pro-
-fessional, skipped school - creatin my own lessons
Confessions of a mad rapper, music got me rappin
Green stretchin, only leads to red stretches
He's next in line, for the blessing
Get your mind off mines, hustle somethin and stop relyin on mine
More then a legend while you lettin time fly by
At age seventeen addicted to ink
A rap fiend who had money dreams
My taste of fame couldn't compare to what I seen
Them dyin, government lyin, hard for that paper cheese
Mom's cryin, watchin her only son through the TV
MTV, BET
He on now wipe me down, no longer fighting through the crowd
I control the crowd, how you like me now, wow

[Chorus] - 2X

[Tyga]
Back to the cool motivational roads
No guidance, just violence and probational homes
Thinkin, my high routes is all out; music gotta be my way out
Family gathered around I gotta make 'em proud
Pops popped in the penitentiary laid out
Hopin his son fell under a different cloud
I'm speakin directly into the crowd
Nothin personal, just thought you would love to know the person
Far from perfect, but nearly word perfect
Must be he weighed him, on a scale from one to me
Me, equal the greatness, money equal to every ten haters
The rest couldn't make it due to unlikely behavior
So be patient, or end up the next patient
Emergency room, newspaper
The new rappers, call 'em street actors
Music wise they playin safety
And I'm shooting off safety, aimin for greatness

[Chorus] - 2X

[Interlude 2X: Tyga]
Now everybody wear your game face
Forget it everybody just do what he say
They wanna move like, they wanna be like
You can do it just like, like, like

[Chorus] - 2X

Cash stackin, like Tetris, it's youthful effervescence
No army arsenals, I'm my only secret weapon
Get the message (got diamonds) I'm gettin cream like a Nestle
Welcome from Compton's Armageddeon</pre>
