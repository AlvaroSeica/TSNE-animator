[Chorus]
Mexico City (City) a place that you can go
and live your life on the low (okay)
Mexico City (City) a place that you can hide
and everything'll be tight (alright)

they want me on murder rap, which violates my probation
ain't no fuckin way I'm stayin here wit what I'm facin
sold my car to a junkyard and bought a one-way bus ride
take me cross the border, I'll cool out and hide
after 80 wicked hours of stale, they hit the last stop
threw me out the bus, left me standing there, asses out
turned and started walkin, tell me what is there to see?
everything was all in spanish but the sign "welcome to mexico city"

[Chorus]
Mexico City (City) a place that you can go
and live your life on the low (okay)
Mexico City (City) a place that you can hide
and everything'll be tight (alright)

maybe I can fetch a job, find a wife start a family
(in M-E-X-I-C-O, C-I, T-Y)
maybe I can get a place, settle down and try to blend in
(in M-E-X-I-C-O, C-I, T-Y)
maybe I can just relax, be myself and quit pretendin
(in M-E-X-I-C-O, C-I, T-Y)
you can say harbor bay or south monterrey
even islands off the map within the dead sea passageway
don't fuckin matter, man, from pakistan to chuck e. chesse's
from the ramada in granada on through far as the equator reaches
virgina beaches, saskatoon, cancum, the blue lagoon
from desert sand dunes, metropolises to the boons
from pueblo north, kakalaki, back to waikiki
they searchin high and low for me but I'm in mexico city

[Chorus]
Mexico City (City) a place that you can go
and live your life on the low (okay)
Mexico City (City) a place that you can hide
and everything'll be tight (alright)</pre>
