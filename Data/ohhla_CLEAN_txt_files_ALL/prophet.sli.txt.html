Song:   Prophet
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

But I ain't no prophet
To cure some damn disease
And would you help me anyway
If I was on my knees
I'm going through my time of change
In my time of need
And every little thing is gonna
Be all the same

And then I thought to my self
I'm gonna marry into wealth
I'm gonna take everything she's got to offer and keep it for myself
Oh yeah
She said to me
I don't like what I see
And I say to her
But I don't even know you there
Every time that I called you up
On the telephone
But each time you say to me
I want to be alone
Well so I hopped in my car
And drove away some place real far
I'm gonna push my pedal straight for the metal
And head right for the bar
She said to me
I don't like what I see
But I say to her
Take off all your underwear</pre>
