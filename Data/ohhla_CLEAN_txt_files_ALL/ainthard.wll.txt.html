Hook: (x2)
If ya lookin for me I aint hard to find
I'll be right there posted on that 59
I got a burner in my lap at all times
and a bag of sticky-icky green limes

Verse 1:
I got that paper in them rubberbands stacked up
and I got somethin hidden in the stash wrapped up
if you see purple in my cup that mean I'm leanin tough
I got them haters on my back so I be strapped up
I'm in a league of my own while them haters throw stones
but my mind on cash, I'm in the zone
I'm grippin wood and tippin chrome
I'm well known, my wrist is rocky like Stalone
Southlea is where I roam
the champ is here and there is no clone
off top, I'm well respected on many blocks
so I'm pullin hunnies and smashin cocks
knockin these broads up out they socks
I'm in the hood like wig shops
look close - I aint hard to spot
I'm right there at that gamblin spot
stackin up a fat not

Hook(x2)

I'm a block burner like Lil Wayne
revisin the game like King James
the heads turnin like Slim Thug chain
I'm bangin hooks like Sugar Shane
I'm thowed off like Major Payne
talkin shit like Clubber Lang
these boys talkin down on the name,
but they all washed up like Eddie Kane
the slab roof like David Blaine - it dissappear like magic
Glock nineteen, made of plastic - might stretch ya out just like elastic
I stay up on my toes til the day that my casket close
bankrolls and fine hoes, fancy cars and starch clothes
weed cigars and Moet rolls, pints of barre and kushy dro
dime collector outside the club in candy toy with the trunk exposed
Swishahouse baby thats my crew
roll with us or you'll get ran thru
we loved by few and still true
let me tell y'all just what it do

Hook(x2)

its Hustle-town Texas
I do this for the streets
grindin with no sleep because that paper what I seek
that hatin need to cease
I'm evadin the police
and I been hustlin since Hulk Hogan body slammed the Iron Sheik
my flow is outta sight, but them boys is all hype
they can't see me up on the mic
so they be hatin me out of spite
some potent purple Sprite
I done paid my dues
out hear the strong survive, but the weak end up on Fox news
sleepless nights with burner in hand cause nowadays them jackers plot
jealousy turn friends to foes I'm packin Glocks around the clock
stackin nots and mackin hoes
chasin paper and ridin vogues
get that dough what I propose
on five-nine double-O
