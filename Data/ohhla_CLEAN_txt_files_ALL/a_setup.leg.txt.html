verse1
[bootleg]
 The police had my house surronded
the body that i hid them bitches musta found it...fuck, 
I grabbed my bottled said a prayer i broke the cap and downed it
I had a vision my decsion was to load my heat
Iif I here dey feet i'm holdin court right here on dayton street
The copas gatherin they chatterin one lady said 
"The only way you gettin him out that house is if he come out dead" 
Ya fuckin right tha shyt is tight when you tha trigga man
Before i goto prison bitch i'm goin to the promise land 
Don't show yo badge
Whip ya postiols before you get my dough
2cops shot him 2cops its time for me to buc some mo (gun shots) 
They got me pacin,facin natural for murder 1 
The only charges i'mma face are charges from this gun.
Antispatin all this waitin made me grab tha plate 
I'm thinkin to myself i shoulda dumped that bitch in devils lake 
Police negotiater tellin me to come out slowly
I cocked my shyt looked out my window and them hoes is steppin.
I opened fire threw my dough and made them bitches flea 
One of them fell and i could tell i bust him in his knee 
Nothin to do put hit purea cuz i'mma die no doubt. 
My first thought was nigga don't get sniped 
Turn all these house lights out.
Layin on the floo high on blow my eyes big and buckey.
The sounds of semi-automatics rifles kept me duckin.
Let me go i crawled and got my uzzie 
I came out tha house they got me

chorus

[bootleg] 
They caught a mothafuka slippin 
Some niggaz tryin to jack this rap capones mission.
Tupac always said "Neva leave out with out that steel"
I shoulda listened 
I left it in the kitchen like a dumby 
To busy cookin dope and checkin my bitch from stealin money from me 
"Bitch where my money at" 
I was on my way to drop some money and some yay 
[some bitch] "ay that mothafuka got dope on ya'll"  
[bootleg] 
And that was clear as day.
I'm bein followed  by threee niggaz in a cutty 
I'm nervous I got 18 ounces on me and stacks of money.
Damn,they in prusuit.fa my loot,
Shyt I left my gun at home 
Fuck that let me get my brotha on his mobile phone 
I make tha call he wasn't home 
Now i'm crummy 
I worked to hard to let these bitches take it from me.
I had a thought shyt put the pedal to tha floo,
Oh no cuz if tha law come i'll be taken a loss fa sho 
Picked up the phone called shoestring 
"Ay some niggaz followin me can i come by ya house"
[shoestring] "come on" 
And I'm gonna kill these bitches with this mac i'm holdin 
I bust a left and then i right now i'm jus 3 blocks away 
Commin up tha block 
Theres hella gangstas standin out in his drive way 
Some sistahs with no resisitances started blastin 
I'm damn near ran into a pole 
I can see tha cutlass is crashin 
I bust U and threw my goodies to my homies 
Told em let me see that mac eleven 
Let me see who tha fuck is creepin on me 
Open tha door "bitches get out"
I got no responces 
Cuz the driver hit his head on the wheel 
And he was knocked un-concious. 
The other two they came slowly from the vehicle,
My stanky bitches brotha this is str8 setup material
