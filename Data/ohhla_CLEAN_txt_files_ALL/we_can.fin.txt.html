[ VERSE 1: Sinquis ]
Listen to my metaphor, I make it better for
Except my competator, cause she's headed for
Destruction, and I could never be a substitute
I go off just like a 99 gun salute
Let me be candid, I gotta hand it
To myself, I'm so good, I can't stand it
You can't top it, the thought - drop it
Cause you know and I know and they know you can't stop it

Cause we can do this

(Get on up)
(Get on up)

Cause we can do this

(Get on up)

(This is how it should be done)

[ VERSE 2: Finesse ]
(3-2-1, ain't nothin to it, it's done
Yo Finesse, go for yours at the sound of the gun)
I get physical, I gets totally sweated
My mic wants to make noise, so I let it
I grab it, and then I shoot it like a rocket
Some try to block it (please) you can't stop it
Cause I'ma do this till it gets done
Don't even think about shorts, cause I take not one
But if one should cross my path
I drop a rhyme on em with a autograph
Cause I can do this

Cause we can do this

(Get on up)
(Get on up)

Cause we can do this

(Get on up)

(This is how it should be done)

Hoooo...
Ah, what's up, y'all
What's up
Finesse &amp; Sinquis goin all out in '88
Dope beat by Eddie F, you know it
You know it
Kyle West is in the house
We got Dr. Jeckyll in the house
Fat Doug in the house
Ah, can't forget him
Road manager of the year
Treat me lovely

[ VERSE 3: Sinquis ]
This is how you do it, ain't nothin to it
Yo Finesse, hand me my Nikes, I gotta run through it
Strictly unpredicted, I gets wicked
(Sinquis, ain't we hype?) That's the only way to kick it
We're outstanding, holding and commanding
Mic to mic, back to back, so throw your hand in
Stop frontin, we ain't jokin
(Sinquis, give me a light, hurry up, so I can smoke em)
Cause when it comes to this it's strictly biz
I grab the mic, I gets hype, that's just how it is
Cause I'm a capital S and, so count your blessin
Don't call my bluff, cause I'm never caught fessin
Cause we can do this

(Get on up)
(Get on up)

Cause we can do this

(Get on up)

(This is how it should be done)

[ VERSE 4: Finesse ]
This is how we do it, with no delayin
I'm paid and I'm smilin, but I ain't playin
Gettin money, cause if it's there, I'ma get it
Drop a beat and if it's def, I'm with it
Like blowin a sax I stay calm and relax
Ducks treathin to tax, I just laugh and I max
They keep playin me close, so let me just make a toast
Shift my rap into drive, and then watch me coast
That's all to it (I knew it) I had to run through it
I told ya, I showed ya - this is how we do it

(Get on up)
(Get on up)

Cause we can do this

(Get on up)

(This is how it should be done)

Cause we can do this

Word
Word up
Ain't no stoppin
Hell no
Cause we can do this
Word
'88, come on
Here we go, y'all
Cause we can do this
Finesse &amp; Sinquis goin all out, '88
This ain't the last time you gon' hear about us, homeboy
We gon' get play
Just like we did the last time
Come back out stronger and stronger everytime
Word up...
Dr. Jeckyll, how was that?
You like that?
I know you did
We outta here
Peace y'all
See ya
10-4 good buddy
Peace
Listen
(This is how it should be done)
