Typed by: AZ Lyrics

People think I'm crazy but I love you cause you crazy too
RADIO KILLA
Red light special, undress me under the candle light
Turnt up in this business
Watch me do all of them things you like
I'm ready to go, ready to plow like grammy night in the back of that limousine
Billy bob, and angeline
All you gotta do, is the say the word
And I'll be right there on ya
All you gotta do, is the say the word
And I'll be right there for ya
To this white light, do that, we like good judda,
Come baby be you, get on it while I see you
Turnt up, all the way to the ceiling
Burnt up, till you ain't got no feeling
On my phone, let's hear it
Talkin bout you gon kill it
Beat it up, until I black out,
Cash up, boy

I need this
Sexy, ratchet, sophisticated, ratchet
The black leather with the sun outside in the summer time, ratchet
She need that cocky ratchet
Ready to call back, ratchet
That drop top, and B symbol, on me what, ratchet

Turnt up, turnt up, turnt up, woh
Turnt up, turnt up, turnt up, woh
Loving everything you do, baby I'm in love with you
Turnt up, turnt up, turnt up, woh
Turnt up, turnt up, turnt up, woh
People think I'm crazy but I love you cause you crazy too

You're my black light special
She hotter than a famous night
Burn up in this... and watch you do all the things I like
Say you the reason why all of these rap niggaz start singing
She say you the reason why all of these cute girls got baby
All you gotta do is say what's happening
And I'll be right there baby
All you gotta do is say what's popping
And I'll be right there shorty
Come on, like serious
I told you I was gon killed it
Got my Chainz on, I'm a kill it, with Michelle, where Kelly

Sexy, ratchet, sophisticated, ratchet
The black leather with the sun outside in the summer time, ratchet
She need that cocky ratchet
Ready to call back, ratchet
That drop top, and B symbol, on me what, ratchet

Turnt up, turnt up, turnt up, woh

Loving everything you do, baby I'm in love with you
Turnt up, turnt up, turnt up, woh
Turnt up, turnt up, turnt up, woh
People think I'm crazy but I love you cause you crazy too
