[Blue Raspberry]
Always talking bullshit on your cell
You ain't need to keep that wack ass dick up on the shelf
Always talking bout how you would break my back
When I saw that shit, I almost had a heart attack
Because your skills is low, oh
I had to freak the flow, oh whoa
You need to stop and check, oh wow
Cuz you ain't bringing me back, oh whoo
Oooh, whoo, I'm kicking it acapella for you
You....</pre>
