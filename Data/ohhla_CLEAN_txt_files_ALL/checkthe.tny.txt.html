Elevation!  Check the foundation
Solid funky from the flamin caucasian
Heat it up, cook it up, bake it up, take it up
Slice it up, dice it up, tear it up, rrrrip it up
Cut it up - now it's time for me to switch it up
Tone's the maaaaaaaaan, who's gonna getcha up
outta your seat, movin your feet, groovin the beat
I won't stop 'til my job's complete
Cause I gotta make ya hyper, occupation sniper
Even little kids be dancin in their diapers
Suckers - be sayin, "Tone you ain't nothin"
But I got more flavor than Stove Top stuffin
Nuts - my favorite past time
Forget the last rhyme cause you can't gas mine
like Sunoco you go bum loco
Visit Acupulco with your girlfriend Yoko, Ono
Bono, them messy tones are no no
You need posession of it?  Fire the phono-
-graph you'll laugh but please the Island staff
Get off the mass - check the elevation

Second stanza - kick the virtuoso
You're just a bozo..
A so-so rhymer, climber, check the Guggenheimer
One's just a number so don't be a two-timer
when you rhyme-a, one way furniture mover..
Bust the Heimlich maneuveur!
Full nelson, I like to eat smelts and other fish
like candy cause it melts in your mouth
And it's also good brain food
Since you're a lame dude, you should eat a whale
Crude oil - spilled over from the Exxon Valdez
It was the captain's fault
Now said the media, really, but what do they now?
Sittin home twiddlin their thumbs in Play-Doh
Fed it to a critic but a critic is a cricket
and they know where they can stick it - check the elevation

Elevation - it's time to kick the third verse
I know you're weak homeboy but yo I heard worse
rappers, so do you feel any better?
Of course you do!  Now write yourself a letter to your mom
As I drop the nuclear bomb
After the explosion everything is calm
Like Hiroshima, or maybe Nagasaki
That's what you get homeboy for bein cocky
Weaklin, you need to pump some iron
Out of breath, relax I hear the siren
from the ambulance - ah bring on the oxygen!
You're like Larry Holmes, you can't box again
You're out of your prime, I oughta show you how to rhyme
People in the audience are saying about time
somebody, did something about these weak suckers
Soft like Smuckers, check the elevation

{"Check out the - check out the voice that is smooth and mild"} - *4X*

[Tony D]
This is the last one, yo I pulled a fast one
You did the dummy move so I'ma gas one
UP, UP AND AWAY
I'm gonna sail a sucker today
Without the use, of a beautiful balloon
I'll hit him with an uppercut and send him to the moon
Like Ralph Kramden, smackin up Alice
There's no kings and queens and no palace
So check it, let me manifest it
You think you dressed it but I'm the one who blessed it
Christened it, with a champagne bottle
Remove the governor and give it more throttle
In a battle, snakes they like to rattle
Competi-shion, a few swine and some cattle
Watch me saddle, up on my high horse
And breeze on my course, check the elevation
