No escaping this

[ Greg Nice ]
Oh, oh, oh! 2 G's mother, uh!
The Beatnuts y'all, uh!
Uh, oh, oh! JuJu, Psycho Les, uh, oh!
Turn it out oh, oh my god oh!
Oh, oh, it's the hardcore b-boy shit!
Uh, hard to the core muthafucka, no keyboard shit!

[ Psycho Les ]
Aiyo, I'm up in the club like ba-ba-ba-ba
Smokin on a blunt, sippin on some vodka
Shorties wanna talk, haters wanna cock-block
Talkin a lotta blah, blah, blah, blah
I make my way to the bar, snatch me up a bottle
By the end of the night I be leavin with a model
There's no escapin this, the rapist is back
On the j-o-b, and I'm still down with O.P.P.
You gon' slowly see how we conquer this rap game
You violate, my pupils dilate
You got a problem with my peoples, dial 1-8-
-00, Psycho Les stay blunted, America's Most
It's the lunatic, straight from a padded cell
We play volley blunts, don't wait for us to pass the l
Nigga, stop feelin yourself and feel these Nuts
Cause "No one's ready to deal with us"

[ JuJu ]
Yo, we back, aren't you happy we came?
All you muthafuckas soundin the same
You're pathetic and your music is lame
Get a little style, try and grow up
Stick your finger in your mouth, throw up
Take a breather, rich, but I would hate to be ya
That's why I never pass you cheeba
Or let you fuck my bitches neither
We hip-hop in the essence
Grant it alone, the mere presence
Put fear in your heart
You're scared cause you never had a ear for the art
Robbin people for they 15 bucks
Bad enough bein 16 sucks
Where all my shorties with the double-d cups?
With the thongs and the platinum butts?
Junkyard, baby, show me your tits
Got a cock that'll blow you to bits
On the real, I'm as good as it gets
Why you people even playin with us?
You know "No one's ready to deal with us"

(No escaping this)
"No one..."	
(No escaping this)
(No escaping this)
"No one..."	
(No escaping this)
(No escaping this)
"No one..."
(No escaping this)
"No one's ready to deal with us"

[ Psycho Les ]
Beatnuts is for the peoples like Democrats
Y'all cats is see-through with those demo tracks
Got you pullin your wig off, you don't understand, bro
Can't believe Billboard Beatnuts plateau
[ JuJu ]
Listen, it's useless, don't even ask
Bein a Nut is a difficult task
You better off with a gun and a mask
Whoever said we was friendly and shit?
I'm nice at makin enemies quit
Get out my face, yo
[ Psycho Les ]
Aiyo, it's Big Psych, every chick like to pit fight
They wanna be my hookers cause I'm the pimp type
You, you know my rank, sonny, top gun
You, you ain't nothin but a old rusty shotgun
[ JuJu ]
You couldn't bust a grape in a food fight
Your whole crew is too light
The Demon talk whenever Ju writes
Stop playin, money, feel these Nuts
Cause "No one's ready to deal with us"

[ Psycho Les ]
We got the VIP on lock, let the bottles pop-pop
Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba
You know we hip-hop 24-7 non-stop
Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba
[ JuJu ]
We got the ecstacy that all the girls wanna pop
Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba
Where my niggas on the block shootin back at the cops?
Like "No one's ready to deal with us"

(No escaping this)

[ Greg Nice ]
Oh, no! Turn it out oh!
Oh my God oh! Turn it out oh! (Repeat 4x)

What the hell is going on?

(No escaping this)

...motherfuckers, they got me in cage!
Let me out!
Let me out now!

[ male voice ]
Come here, sissy, I'm takin you hostage

[ female voice ]
They're gonna come for me

[ Psycho Les ]
Corona in the house

Let me out this damn cage!

[ Psycho Les ]
Throw your hands up
[ JuJu ]
Throw your hands up
