[Mary J. Blige - Intro]
Don't forget, to remem-ber meeeeeeeeeee...
(Let's get 'em, Mary)

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige] (T.I.)
Don't forget, to remeeeeember me (Ay, don't forget shawty)
I'll be back, so remeeeeember me  (Remember this..)
Please keep me in your heart, if we ever have to part (Ay, don't forget shawty) 
Don't forget, -get, to remeeeeeember me

[T.I. - Verse 1ne]
(It's the King, homie)
Ay, the King, modern-day Martin Luther, Malcolm X, I'm 
officially the freshest, don't dare forget, I'm 
gone, momentarily, don't bury me yet 
Like Ali got, I got the title back, prepare me to that 
When the world needed Tip, ask where he was at 
But when he need somethin back, nigga fade to black 
Talk shit behind his back, you a hater for that
I don't expect nothin less, in the game of chess 
You think five moves ahead and not behind 
Niggaz jumped up, cheered when I got my time 
Like, "Yeah! One whole year I got the grind" 
But get me losin off your mind shawty, may I remind you that 
there ain't another nigga who done been through what I been through 
Time after time again, you better get some in you
When you, said it was over for him and you thought 
He couldn't continue to floss, here's to your memory loss, suckas!

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige] (T.I.)
Don't forget, to remeeeeember me (Ay, don't forget shawty, ay, don't forget shawty )
I'll be back, so remeeeeember me  (Yeah, yeah, remember this, shawty)
Please keep me in your heart, if we ever have to part (Yeeea! It won't be long, shawty) 
Don't forget, -get, to remeeeeeember me (Ay, don't forget shawty)

[T.I. - Verse 2wo]
(Here we GO!)
They say, outta sight's out of mind 
and nine times, out of ten, men out of pocket out of line 
You do it big, errybody that you out-shined 
Then your ol' lady fate talk 'bout how she got fine 
She say she was tryin to get away, he say, "About time" 
Right now we all thinkin "Damn, hopin not mine" 
But when it's lights out for ya and you locked down 
Ain't no tellin whether or not your lady went and got down 
wit the nigga cross town, 'cause he hot now 
Rippin up your love letters, liftin up her night gown 
Right now, somebody baby momma gettin piped down
Kids in the next room listenin, "Momma pipe down!" 
The thought hurt, don't it? But maybe she's strong enough 
or, ain't get that lonely, 'cause you wasn't gone long enough 
But trust, it's just a temporarily setback
It's on when I get back, please don't forget dat!

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige] (T.I.)
Don't forget, to remeeeeember me (So remember this, shawty)
I'll be back, so remeeeeember me  (It's the King, bitch!)
Please keep me in your heart, if we ever have to part (Ay, don't forget shawty) 
Don't forget, -get, to remeeeeeember me (Take it out, Mary)

[Mary J. Blige - Bridge]
I don't mean to feel like this
Don't mean to think like this 
My heart just has to be sure 
That the love that I give to you 
That's the love that I get from you 
I NEED to be safe and secuuuuuure, oooh-oooh
(Just let me know you thankin 'bout me)

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige] (T.I.)
Don't forget, to remeeeeember me (Ay don't forget, shawty, ay, don't forget shawty)
I'll be back, so remeeeeember me  (Keep me on your mind, shawty)
Please keep me in your heart, if we ever have to part (Ay, don't forget shawty) 
Don't forget, -get, to remeeeeeember me
No, no, no- no, no, nooooooo

[T.I. - Outro]
Just a friendly message for everybody, man
who thought I was gone forever
Partna, it's a year and a day and countin, ya understand that?
By the time you hear this, I'll prol'ly be halfway home
Now remember dat, suckas! Hehehehe!</pre>
