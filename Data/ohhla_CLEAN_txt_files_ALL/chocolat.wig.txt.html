[Shawn Wigs]
Aiyo son, I rock chocolate wallos without the laces
Walk out of Cochran's court with smiling faces
It's Theodore, grand son Beat Street the Fifth
Got the gift to season your broth and stay stiff
Rock beats til the Towers is built, hundred plus
While Halle Berry get dick late night on the Bang Bus
We, cuss the church and cop lights from the candle box
Spot your cowards like pox, been through more
Dirt than rocks, stole my style from the blocks
Rubberband stashed in my socks, I'mma ox
I'm animal, beast, to say the least
If you down with the Unit, then your palm get greased, man
It's Theodore, we walk the floor
Coming to your town, I'm ready to make scores
One gun, two gun, three guns, four
All over the town, ready to get more</pre>
