You know lately I've been envisioning, intentionally, injuring

While you wet clothes and fake your pimp mode
I'm gathering chemical info
On how to make your neck lymph nodes implode
When I go home, I bathe in ozone
Take my microphone and crush for dome like ices
Slurp it like a snow-cone
I spark a shot at those who talk a lot
Put garbage rappers on a murder auction block
Until the coffin plot market's hot
All my lines are so unorthodox
They enter you like carbon monox'
And you still be alive while you carcass rots
The sickest dude you'll ever hate
I elevate and raise the bars
As if I was making a nightclub levitate
You'll never be the one like seven-eighths
I'll become irate and strap you to a tailgate
Then drag you through eleven states
Emcees scorched with a million degree torch
Your thoughts are small enough to fit them all in a flea's corpse
Your rap image got resemblance to a lesbian broad
You looked the part
You flipped your tongue but you can never get hard
I stay in the mode and steam-rolled right over my foes
I'm on the stage ripping up shows in a Doberman pose
My flow is errorless; to withstand the test you need a better vest
I'm never stressing, always starting shit like the letter 'S'
Unanimously denied your amnesty 
At your reunion I handedly mopped your family under the canopy
I start and run upon ya with a sharp persona
Target you in the farthest part of Venus
Hiding in a closet in the darkest corner
Equipped with a flame that will rip through a train
Scriptural gain pointing at you with centripetal aim
The antithesis of the word insane bleeding disdain
What I inflict is beyond torture, you'll be pleading for pain
Murder juices with my first producers
In gestation of these exclusives leave you heathens steaming green mucus
Atrocities hit and stop ya nine bodily systems
You'll get gutted out like jail house sodomy victims
Pay dues, my rep is huge, you set new records for skill ineptitude
Methods I use reduce decrepit crews to residue
Exposing fools, my words are valuable like stolen jewels
Your flows are used
You turn them back in when you use 'em like bowling shoes
Maniacal fiend that seething for green
Put cyanide in an asthmatic rapper's breathing machine
My omnipotent ambiance will turn a room blue
1% of me inside of a 100% of you over consumes' you
Delivering barbwire whipping discipline
Backspin the remnants your non-existence, ten dimensions past oblivion
I mastered wizardry during my infancy 
I blink and instantly remove you from the archives of living memory
Soaring above the Earth's floor and I'm orbiting 
Foraging through scorching unseen dark matter specs exploring the origins
The impact of my most average raps will fracture your scapula
Drain the sap from your cardiovascular with a catheter
Technology in my mind exceeds the current time
Like somebody using an iPod in 1689
You should know there be no decoding my poetry
My opponents keep coming slower than rolling three lines on a rotary
The one man genealogy, my bloodline's author
I'm myself, my future offspring and my own grandfather
The laborer, the great outerspace phrase caterer
Nuclear wave rave, sabre-tooth hater disabler
The solar rollerblader; I skated across craters
State of the art debater, thoughts integrated with Darth Vader 
In victories I'll never get enough
My sick degrees will rip you up
And leave a gash so critical that I'll have to zip you up
He killed himself because to face me is double
He knew my schedule was busy so he saved me the trouble
If you mad I'm not the one you should blast on
Listen I'm so twisted that under my real face I got a mask on</pre>
