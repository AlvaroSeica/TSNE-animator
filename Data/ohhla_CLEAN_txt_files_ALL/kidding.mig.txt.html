Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro: Takeoff &amp; Quavo]
Fuck!
Must be kidding me
Slam my nigga
Nah, nigga don't play with me
Migo!

[Chorus]
They say he ran off with the pack, goddamn
They say the plug going out like Nino Brown
They say the nigga that robbed you is in the trap right now
I said I pull up, and start damping at the whole crowd
Nigga better stop playing with me

You know that they taking your style?
It's all on the radio, like right now!
Who the hell said we a one hit wonder?
Migo pockets sloppy like lasagna, nigga stop playing with me

[Verse 1: Takeoff]
Who the fuck said QC we ain't on top? Gotta be kidding me
Who the fuck said YRN2 gon' flop? Must be kidding me
The niggas that didn't believe in me
The people that didn't believe in me
Versace, Versace it topped the charts
Now I'm on BET and MTV
Remember back then watching Oprah?
Now I'm on the sofa with Oprah
Louboutins all on her sofa
No strings attached cause these loafers
OG gas pack got the odor
Green like Shrek that's an ogre
Taking my swag and exposure
Pull up to your house and foreclose ya'

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Thought I fucking told you fuck nigga better stop playing with me
Hop out with the dirty stick, the drum, holds infinity
My bitch run down with 50 chickens in an SRT
I ain't make it out of high school, it ain't no shame in me
I'm richer than my teachers, damn I know I bet they mad at me
With yo' red light on, in the bando get it like Krispy Kremes
Hit the pot with the left hook, Quavo-Kareem
You ain't never seen a mountain of snow on that triple beam

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Offset]
All of you niggas you mimic me, you kidding me? Literally
Controlling the block with good quality
Hurricane in the kitchen, a catastrophe
I'm number one you are the niggas after me
Wrapping my bitch up in diamonds from Tiffany's
Everyday a holiday, epiphany
All you pussy niggas talking and bickering
Ya'll don't even make no goddamn sense
Cuffing the same bitch I fucked that's my bitch
Whoosh, pack gone missing
Soon as you touch on my hand it's disappearing instantly
Diamonds on me looking like it's a photo
Guiseppe's and now they walking on komodo
Feelin' like Austin they stealing my mojo
Trapping and capping we selling that yayo

[Chorus]</pre>
