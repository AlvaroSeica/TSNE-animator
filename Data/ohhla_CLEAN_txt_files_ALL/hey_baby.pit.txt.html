Let her go, ooh la la la la
If your girl wanna play, let her go
Said let her go, ooh la la la la
If your girl wanna play, let her go

[Chorus: T-Pain] + (Pitbull)
Hey baby girl what'chu doin tonight?
I wanna see what you got in store
Hey, hey baby! You givin it you all when you're dancin on me
I wanna see if you give me some more
Hey, hey baby! You can be my girl, I can be your man
And we can pump this jam however you want
Hey, hey baby! Pump it from the side, pump it upside down
Or we can pump it from the back to the front
Hey, hey baby!
(Ooh, baby baby - la la la la la la la) Ah-ahh!
(Ooh, baby baby - la la la la la la la) Ah-ahh!
(Ooh, baby baby - la la la la la la la) Ah-ahh!
(Ooh, baby baby - la la la la la la la) Hey, hey baby!
Ooh, drop it to the floor
Make me wanna say - hey, hey baby
Yeah, you can shake some more
Make you wanna say - hey, hey baby
Ooh you got it; cause you make me wanna say - hey, hey baby
Yeah don't stop it (I want you tonight)

[Pitbull]
I'm a Dade county, self-paid
Self-made, millionaire
I used to play, around the world
Now I'm around the world, gettin paid
Girl problems, no problems
Don't hate the King no that won't solve 'em
I wanna get wit'cha mami
Now let me see what the lord split'cha - Lordy!

[Chorus]

[Pitbull]
Make money, make money
This chico right here gotta eat baby
Cause scared money don't make money
That's how it goes in the street baby
But enough about the nonsense
Baby girl take a shot, clear your conscience
Not a goon or a goblin, I'm a monster
Cause I hit all the baddest women in the world (GANKSTA)
Ooh, baby baby - la la la la la la la {*4X*}

[Outro]
Hey, hey baby!
Ooh, drop it to the floor
Make me wanna say - hey, hey baby
Yeah, you can shake some more
Make you wanna say - hey, hey baby
Ooh you got it; cause you make me wanna say - hey, hey baby
Yeah don't stop it (I want you tonight)</pre>
