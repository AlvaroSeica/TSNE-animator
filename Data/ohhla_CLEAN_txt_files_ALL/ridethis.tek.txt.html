[Intro: Tekitha]
Oh, strive, strive
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You can run, you can run

[Chorus: Tekitha]
You can run, you can run by
You can rock me, you can ride by
You can run, you can run by
You can rock me, you can ride by

[Hook: Tekitha]
You can run this way
If you have a ton to say
Come to me, my love
Show me and your feelings

[Tekitha]
Take you on a voyage
And show you when it's depending
Check out your surroundings, and yea
For the feelings love can take
Take you on a ride, catch this way and you can fly
Sent it on to me, or see through the naked eye
Can enter into you, and build up until you're screwed
I'll only take you, if you want to go

[Hook]

[Chorus]

[Tekitha]
The land be rich and spored
Almost died and levetation...</pre>
