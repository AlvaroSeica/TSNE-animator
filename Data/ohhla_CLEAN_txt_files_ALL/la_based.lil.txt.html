Bitch fuck me, I'm rich now
Came in the club, with the peas down
Fuckin where them bitches know to get down
Hey brah, you heard she straight now?
Gangster in the room told the bitch bow
I'm beefing in the club with the long dance
Nigga I ain't eat like I'm supposed to
Right here that over, that's pop culture
Brand new car with the chauffeur
It's thug life, it's real wild, 4 ext team with the long...
Bitches on my dick, bitch cause I run wild
Askin if I'm really down, man, the funk about erything
I'm a tell you that's my name it's Lil B
Put your middle fingers up if you feeling me

Put your middle fingers up in the air
Task force leon, prepare
The people on the rear
We gonn have a party up in here

Go dumb bitch, go stupid, go dumb bitch, go stupid
Go dumb bitch, go stupid, go dumb bitch, go stupid
Go dumb bitch, go stupid, go dumb bitch, go stupid
Go dumb bitch, go stupid, go dumb bitch, go stupid
Go dumb bitch, go stupid, go dumb bitch, go stupid

I'm a real thug like 40, at the slots and mall buying erything
I'm a real nigga so respect me
Based God I got bitches on jet ski
Beverly hills, what's good
I got new bitches ain't... the city
Bitch I think I'm p diddy
Fucking bitches, for 2 50
Pink flame, yeah we gonn turn up
Yeah, pink flame, roll it up
Hey man ole, shouts out to the whole LA
It's your boy Lil B, bitch, pink flame</pre>
