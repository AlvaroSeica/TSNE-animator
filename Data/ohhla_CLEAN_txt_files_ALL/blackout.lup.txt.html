I'm feelin' like
I ain't feelin' right
I'm feelin' like
I'm feelin' fly
Right in the sky
Unidentified
Flying object
That I sit inside
You can get a ride
Just get in line
Hand by your heart
Like memorize
Ask God please
Could you energize?
Beam on up
To the Enterprise
From the inner-city
Or the winter-city
Where's Mini-mini?
Not Mini-me's
Only Mini-me's
Not a lot of hymns
Only one eye
Whole lot of them
Saw a cyclops
That's a eye clock
Like a Rolex
With a eye patch
See what I got
Matches on the wall
Plus a crazy flow
Suicide watch
I'm just killin' time
Plus I'm insane
In a straight jacket
But it's Romanelli
I'm just gettin' back
For now it's kinda poor
Want to have things
Couldn't afford a Pelle
So don't mind me
'cause I ain't got a mind
I don't front hard
I ain't got a mind
I'm just gettin' mine
But don't step here
Because it's unbear
That I didn't find
Nympho mo' top
Like a mohawk
I remember when
I was so not
It was no locks
Man I couldn't ball
I was so bald
Robocop
I was Mr. Clean
Now I'm Mr. T
But a different team
F &amp; F rules
Call me F.I.
From the west side
And I'm underground
Pepperin' you fool (yeah homey)

Creepin' on a come up, history, we gonna rewrite that
Left for a minute but I told you I'll be right back
I know you're slummin' and you feel me want to be like that
Well you can't see me, that's 'cause everything is black
(Black x7)

And I'm feelin' good
Like a villian would
If he was doin' bad
Kill Superman
Tied to a log
Push into a saw
Take a little dog
Right through the fan
And it mean man
Like a dictionary
Like a definition
Like you never listen
Not the "ition" endin'
But the def/deaf part
Break it in half
Like an intermission
You'll see then
What I mean then
Or what I meant there
Doesn't impair
Now you're learnin' it
Keep rehearsin' it
'til it's permanent
Like pimp hair
Got an empire
I'm the emperor
Like the cat were
I'll be faster
You're tryin' to add syrup
Just to slow me down
But I blow 'em down
Like I'm half-were
That's wolf-man
You got a full house
I got a full moon
Then I pull out
The ace up my sleeve
Like my hand hurt
Lend me your chips
What they took now
What they put now
Gotta look down
And check your shoulder
'cause I'll be over
Like a boater
You got boulders
In your loafers
Put your foot down
While I ottoman
Or a Laz-E-Boy
Or a handstand
See I elevate
Like Otis
My toes is
And my flow sick
Let it marinate
Try to break it down
Might take a while
All good though
I'll wait around
While you chase it down
That white rabbit
Down that long hole
Like paper towels (yeah homey)

Creepin' on her, come up mystery, we gonna rewrite that
Left for a minute but I tell you I'll be right back
I know you're slummin' and you feel me want to be like that
Well you can't see me, that's 'cause everything is black
(Black x13, everything is black)
(Black x12, you can't see me)

So this light's out
Like a lighthouse
In the daytime
Make it lay down
Make it go to bed
Make it go to sleep
Like D-bo
When he was chokin' Craig
That's a headlock
It's what I said I got
The whole game in
Like shooter box
Then the Shokazuki
If you don't know the movies
I ninja vanish
Michael Dudikoff
I get super low
I get super lost
I be super cool
Like a super boss
Say they super bad
But they super soft
Like super chicken
Without the super sauce
Let's step out
It's a rap now
Blow your candles
And your lamps out
When I pull up
You can pull the plug
'cause it's game over
It's a black out

Creepin' on her, come up mystery, we gonna rewrite that
Left for a minute but I tell you I'll be right back
I know you're slummin' and you feel me want to be like that
Well you can't see me, that's 'cause everything is black
(Black x13, everything is black)
(Black x12, you can't see me)</pre>
