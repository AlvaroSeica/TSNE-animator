[Intro]
Hey Bibby wuddup bro man
150 rock block shit man
Niggas want smoke man
These niggas don't want no smoke man
You want smoke man, Let us know something
Vito city shit
Bitch ah

[Chorus]
I be with some young wild niggas, they'll blow something
If you want smoke boy let a nigga know something
Pussy ass niggas talking shit, ain't on nothing
Fuck niggas sneak dissin, let a nigga know something
Let a nigga know something, let a nigga know something
If you want smoke boy let a nigga know something
Let a nigga know something, let a nigga know something
If you want smoke boy let a nigga know something

[Verse 1 - Lil Herb]
I be with some young wild niggas smoking loud nigga
Mally got that 40 cal with him, blow you down nigga
I come to the block and post up
I don't be up in the hood just to put no post up for my Instagram
All these niggas putting post up on they Instagram
Like these niggas really on some
Them lil instant bands
If you want smoke let me know some, we attend to that
Pull up right there where you post up, we remember that
4-5 double barrels, boy we got long noses
Let his homie know to send his mama all roses
Sipping the 4, ACT make me fall over
Run up on me pussy, clap! now its all over
Nigga I be spendin racks turn em all over
Ball till you fall, nigga what you fall over?
If I ever fall nigga I'mma ball over
Started from the bottom, I'd do it all over
Nigga I be fresh as fuck, Louie all over
All white Ones nigga I dont like loafers
Squad hit the club, buying all white rosÃ©'s
Throwing bands, gettin mud on the all white sofas
Want war? 50 clip for all yall soldiers
Niggas bitches taking group pictures, all yall posers
Young nigga couple chains, all of us froze
Couple hits out the foreign cars all em stolen

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Lil Bibby]
You sneak dissin like a ho or sum
And my young niggas show em something
Headshot, I throw em something
I'mma make sure he know what's coming
And my squad won't go for none
If it's beef let me know it's something
If I'm like em then blowin some
Catch Bibby at the store some
Cocaine I can call some
Fuck rap homie, I'm in the trap homie
Work came in put my taxs on it
Real shit, I ain't gotta act homie
Feds come through
I'm running out the back homie
Couple hollows to the back homie
Thats what you get for running from the mack homie
Turn nothing into something
Got a young nigga stuntin
We ain't worried bout nothing cuz we strapped homie
Hut one hut two
Hittas on point, they ready to slump you
Niggas all quiet, when my squad come through
Brand new Glock let's see what the gun do
Them checks I thumb thru
I be flexed up, these niggas can't take it
Ain't about money, then a nigga can't make it
Fuck from the back and her head was whack
I pass her the pack, the bitch is so basic
Hoes know it's cray when they Lil Bibby
Young ass nigga got the keys to the city
Me and lil bro just speedin in the Hemy
In the club squad getting off the weed and the remy
If you want beef then let a nigga know
Subtweeting why you won't @ a nigga foe
You tried to kill Bibby, just let this shit go
Til you show up in the cage then we at a nigga door

[Chorus]</pre>
