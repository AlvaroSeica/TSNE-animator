[Verse 1]
Ay, I know your tears more than you cause I see 'em so much
That's what happens when you're here with no trust, okay
I lied, cheated, you cried
You done worse shit, and I'm still here, right?
And motherfuck your friends, all them hoes hatin'
If you're not down, then what's your location
I called and checked in every night, and that was not probation
They gave they two cents and we ain't ask for no donation
Man, you on some other, other shit
Just found out about my other, other bitch
Went from "I love ya" to "Ya don't know who ya fuckin' with"
Fresh off of vacay and already need another trip (Do it)
She said I had enough tries
Oh, and I'm the reason that she doesn't trust guys (Oh)
What's the perfect girl if it's not the perfect time
If you wanna leave fine

[Chorus]
Just don't tell me you love me, you're gonna make it too hard for me
I wish you were ugly, it wouldn't be so hard to leave
'Cause baby I hate to, love you, I can't make up my mind
'Cause right when I tell you, it's over
By the end of the night, I be right back in bed witchu
You, you, you, oooh, oh, I be right back in bed witchu
You, you, you, oooh, oh, so don't tell me you love me

[Verse 2]
Wishin' I would've tried more
She wanted the truth, truthfully I wish I lied more
'Cause when I was true, all I heard was bye more
Fuck you, who is that, and I don't know why more
We were picture perfect, and I tore it all apart
But if I pick up all the pieces, we could still be a collage
Feelin' like we ended too soon
Used to stay home and do it in all the rooms
Back shots, I know what you like
Had you hittin' high notes and you don't even need no autotune (Do it)
Nights I was Patron'ed up
Girls dressed alike lookin' like they cloned up
Same nights I wouldn't pick my phone up
And you was thinkin' "Damn boy, grow up!"
And I could still hear her leavin'
Crazy, when a heart breaks, it never breaks even
I even found another girl that's perfect
And I'm the only reason we're not workin'
'Cause what's the perfect girl, if it's not the perfect time
And if you wanna stay, fine

[Chorus]
Just don't tell me you love me, you're gonna make it too hard for me
I wish you were ugly, it wouldn't be so hard to leave
'Cause baby I hate to, love you, I can't make up my mind
'Cause right when I tell you, it's over
By the end of the night, I be right back in bed witchu
You, you, you, oooh, oh, I be right back in bed witchu
You, you, you, oooh, oh, so don't tell me you love me

So don't tell me you love me, whatever you do, whatever you do
So don't tell me you love me
So don't tell me you love me, whatever you do, whatever you do
So don't tell me you love me</pre>
