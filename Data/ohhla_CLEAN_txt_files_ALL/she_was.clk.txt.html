[E-40 and B-Legit talking]
Hey what's E, Ah I can't call it just chill like an alcoholic
It's like that huh, yeah
Hey what's up with lil' baby you had last night yo
Ah she was cute and shit but I had to put on my clown suit
Check it out

[E-40]
Only sixteen, thick as fuck
Gigantic size tits, big ass bust
She ain't trippin' her tight jeans was fittin' manish
Mint condition man, major damage
Potent dope, no joke
Bottle of suffix, I knew she wasn't smokin' no coke
Look hella tempted while I'm mustin'
The bad thing about it I was pressed in her cousin Tammy
But that's another story though
Nothin' worth relevant, let's talk about the sixteen year old
Sexy and seducitve, quite impressive
I macked on baby when she least expect it
Designer clothes at the neighborhood laundry
Can I help you, oh by the way my name is E baby
She said I already know my cousin done spilled her guts
Said she did some stuff in yo 1970 Cut
I replied is that right, the boss and the hideous
That tight ass bitch Ginger ain't got nothin' on this
As far as havin' me get, I spit the playa poppin' con
I put that piece in the box, snatched her up and we was gone
I said what about yo nigga, the boss and hood bounty
Wasn't he supposed to pick yo ass up, she said fuck him
I said let's go get twisted, she said my house ain't far
I got a king-sized bed, satin sheets, and a bar
To the velvet rugs, past the liquor store
She said homie just step on it, moms get home at four
I said OK, no problem hella juice from the beat
Smashed on the gas, I see her house down the street
I finally made it, hmmm what is this here
Baby came out the kitchen with a trunk full of beer
I rushed to the niznack time for sex
Like my partner Waldo, E-40 at his best
She was kind of tense, yeah it made sense
I said to myself I might have to hit that there fence
She said let's calm down, we really gotta check it
I don't know about you but I'm ready to get butt naked
She said me too, then I said cool
Unzipped my pants showed her my dick like a fool
She said I'm so hot, touchin' her crotch
Stripped down to nathin' laid on the couch
My shit ain't even in, clitoris tinglin'
Give me some more that what the hiefer was mumblin'
Let's get on the floor, that's what I had to say
She said I like it from the back, I said the rectum or the crevay
Ass in the air, I'm about to dig up in her
Went in the crib but thought before I entered
Chlamydia no, I better check that ho
Dug in my ear the wax let me make it clear
The finger that I use, stuck it in the grill
Searched for some cups if it burns it's chlamydia
Old day tactic taught by my uncle
If ya gonna have the front hold it tight don't buckle
Armed with the test, not a pain or sting
This I presume that the bitch is kind of clean
Unzip the Trojan, better safe than sorry
Stretched it to fit, told it feel like calamari
Am I makin' love, she said no ya not
Should I keep it up, she said I'm nuttin' don't stop
How does it feel, she said such a large cock
I continue to tax the bitch like H &amp; R Block
Back in forth, forth and back just call me ball
These rug burns got my knees feelin' kind of raw
She's bustin' nuts repeatedly can't be mad at me
I'm lastin' longer than a Doracell battery
To the lessons of clock, got pin and a cock
Got two and a half non-stop and the door ain't locked
I'm out of line like a patient
Went deep into the fullopian tubes, released my frustration
Moms walks in, sniffin' and shit
Actin' like she wanted some of this big dick
She said my tits, clit be hard as brick ya aught to try it
She said move over girl let me show ya how to ride it
She started lickin' my dick with much philosophy
I'm feelin' like I won the lottery
From the head to the scrotum gobblin'
She even sucked my toes something slobberin'
Don't even tweak, I'm a nympho ya didn't know
I said what sign is you, she said Scorpio ya know

[E-40 and B-Legit talking]
Oh so that's what went down with ol' baby right
I thought you heard
I told ya man, the facts been proven man
These sedity hoes be choosen
Like that, why don't ya switch ya partner number man
I wanna see this type of game ya know
Ya know that ain't no problem, I sign off
If I got to, you still got them black jack things
I thought you heard, let's go get twisted or something though
Yeah you too though, I got that too
Ah front it man, all them cops glidin'
You know they on that shit, yeah</pre>
