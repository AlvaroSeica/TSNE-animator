[Sean Price]
Yo! Listen... Afghanistan
Bombed out, defeated, I'm weeded, needin a Atavan
Run up on a rapper when rappin that's when I slap a fan
Bone crunch you niggies and gypsies needin a caravan
Half-man, half-amazing, Mandela
You know the flow is so hard, "ella," Duck Down
is the label but - fuck a record deal
Broke after I smoke and the motherfuckin sucker feel
P, keep ignorin my shit B
I punch your shit off like you snore and you're Big B
All in my face like a rap battle
Fuck around and catch all of the eighth when the gat rattle
That hardcore rappin is played out
until I hardcore slap you then ask you what's played out
(What's played out man?) P, indeed the groan
See the grown, be believin nigga Caesar home
P!! (Work wet, wetwork, with the sket red blue)
Oh shit

[Sean Price]
Verse two
Sunroof khaki for the Earth dirt view
Work wet, wetwork, with the sket red blue
Vest protect chest but never your neck Duke
Dave Dulah, fist arrange, I wave Rugers
Engage shooters in battle whether I hate you or

[Ruste Juxx]
Aiyyo kill noid paragraph, crack ground, shatter glass
Ill boy, Madagas', bitch with a fatter ass
Top on the rooftop, spit shine my shit
Pitch grind my strip, switch crime rhyme hits
(Wooo~!) Got a towel better throw it in
Frontline banger, P cover me, I'm goin in
Warpath is bloody, damaged from one sword stroke
48 tracks to slide, and the board broke
What it do? Coke Kilo Gram Crew
The bars is barbaric, +Encino Man 2+
Pull a Runyon on the corner with a onion
In the booth I'm the dragon breathin fire out the dungeon
Fuck a metaphor, fuck you think the metal for?
Put the mic down, fuck rap, peddle raw
+Street Fighter+, Juxx strike like +Bison+
The nigga ghostwritin for Price on "Mic Tyson"</pre>
