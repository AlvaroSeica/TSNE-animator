[Ken Dawg]
It's Mo Thug, it's Ken Dawg
Let me lean on in your mind
Hit you one time
See, here it's Ken rollin' off this Hen
I got to do this shit again for these niggas
Who didn't think Ken was bringin' work
But now I got your eyes open, now, busta, stay alert
Prefer to smoke that hitter
Yeah, wig splitter, take two hits and pass
'Cause it's that two hitter quiter
Did I hear a busta hatin'?
'Cause he's violatin'
Why I got playas all around in my face fakin'
Mistakin' me for a fake?
Playa knowin' I ain't
I can't do that type of sucka shit
'Cause I'm 'bout bank
Rollin' with a click that's straight puttin' it down
Playa get your smoke on to that Mo Thug sound, right

Nuthin' but the playa in me
It's nuthin' but the playa in me

[Ken Dawg]
You heard me puttin' it down from the C-Town
Playa, we heatin' niggas up, roll with click of playas
We're real street figures
Beat hustlas down if you ain't got my paper
And if there's no intention of payin' me
I'm a have to fade you, that's real
So, gon' and take it for what it's worth
Playa hatin' fellas on the outskirts
Mad a nigga done came up and did his thing
Now the topic of conversation  is Ken Dawg
Now, playa, if you lookin' tight
Then I'm gonna give you P's
I wish all of the playa haters would follow me
Rollin' high, passin' by, my mind will fly
The stress is far behind, and don't ask why
I'm Ken Dawg, my brothers, don't I'm trying to deal
Every time I hit ya, I'm spittin' real shit
Real hits, so, y'all, go on and relax, (y'all)
All laid back in all them Cadillacs, right

Nuthin' but the playa in me
It's nuthin' but the playa in me

[Ken Dawg]
It's nuthin' but the playa in me at all times
I'm floatin' through the city in the droppin' twenty-five
I know y'all feel me
Don't spill the Henessey
'Cause then you're gonna have to see me
Naw, I can't get like that about no drink
But I can get like that about my bank
And I be sayin' shit to make these niggas flip the script
hear the hit, and that must've been it
I'm in it to win it, don't be P.O.in' on me
Rollin' through this madness all lonely
Niggas is actin' phony
Don't be like them regular competitors
Stressin' 'bout them tricks on the regular
I'm Ken Dawg, I'm doin' it to you right (right)
Every time I put it down
It's all tight (it's all tight)
We all high, we all high
Lit up, lit up, lit up
So, go on and get your hands up
Nigga, what?  

Nuthin' but the playa in me
It's nuthin' but the playa in me
It's Mo Thug it's Ken Dawg
It's ?
Yeah</pre>
