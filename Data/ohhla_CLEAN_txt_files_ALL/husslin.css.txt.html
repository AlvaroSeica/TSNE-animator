[Swizz Beats]
Turn it up so they can hear this. It's Full Surface, y'all. Cassidy
c'mon! I said...It's Full Surface, y'all. Cassidy, c'mon!

[VERSE 1]
These niggaz wanna act like Cass, wanna stack like Cass
Wanna copy my gear, wear they hat like Cass
Then they try to spit it on a track like Cass
But niggaz hear the track and say, ("That's not Cass!")
Cats don't be clappin' wit the gat like cass
One shell'll make back crack like crabs
Ya flow played out, you been wack like plaid
I peel bills and they come back like scabs
The hoes know won't nobody mack like Cass
Lay the pipe and hit it from the back like Cass
The chain hang, diamonds in that like glass
This crap life switched to the rap life fast

[CHORUS 2x]
From the block to the studio back to the block
Yeah I rap over packs on the block
I'm husslin' (All night long!)
I'm husslin' (To the break of dawn!)
Come on!

[VERSE 2]
These niggaz wanna shop like Cass, play the block like Cass
Wanna copy my flow so they hot like Cass
Niggaz try and get it on lock like Cass
But niggaz hear ya shit and say, ("That's not Cass!")
You don't take bullets out the box like Cass
Load guns that hold a hundred shots like Cass
Roll like Cass, stroll like Cass
Got the blimp that be pimpin' all the hoes like Cass
Niggaz don't be sittin' in the Rov like Cass
Wit the Rolls gold, got they wrist froze like Cass
Who can play the strip and get it sold like Cass
This rap life done switched to my old life fast

[CHORUS 2x]
From the block to the studio back to the block
Yeah I rap over packs on the block
I'm husslin' (All night long!)
I'm husslin' (To the break of dawn!)
Come on!

[VERSE 3]
These niggaz want a brick like Cass to get rich like Cass
Put a bunch of punch lines in they shit like Cass
It's a million niggaz tryna spit like Cass
But niggaz hear they shit and say, ("That's not Cass!")
I get mad when try and bees like this
And dudes that produce try and bees like Swizz
They hit the keys on the MP's like Swizz
But when the beat play I say, "He's not Swizz!"
Y'all niggaz just can't shine like us
We put in time, niggaz ain't grind like us
Name two niggaz you could find like us
Wit the hard beats and the hard rhymes like us

[CHORUS 2x]
From the block to the studio back to the block
Yeah I rap over packs on the block
I'm husslin' (All night long!)
I'm husslin' (To the break of dawn!)
Come on!</pre>
