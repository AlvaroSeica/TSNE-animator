Yeah we finally here y'all
Pumpkinhead, Marco Polo
This is the album right here, "Orange Moon Over Brooklyn"
SoulSpazm, c'mon let's go!

This is the beginning of greatness, I broke out the Matrix
Take a deep breath, open up your platelets
And take this and make this your own, face it
In case kids try to recreate this in clone
I was spawned of a different breed, a bloodline of kings
Downloaded into your dreams, in the form of MP3
Been on two labels, one took a break the other folded
They didn't understand what I had was golden
A leader amongst thieves, a warrior amongst men
Since the age of 13, a savant with a pen
Put me in front of a microphone I'll spit out a gem
covered in phlegm, music I make it rough to the end
Brooklyn born and bred, and I got the solution
Drop all your acts, clean up your roster, stop the pollution
Kids watchin illusions on TV, brainwashed
So I wanna divert they attention and try not to lose 'em
Are you with me?  Or is this too much rebellion?
Pumpkinhead is what they call me but I've been nicknamed a hellion
I'm the fallin of the Berlin Wall, the end of apartheid
The feelin of comin home from war and seein your moms with her arms wide
I should be on the list of your all-time favorites
Luckily I have patience; amazingly
I will wait 'til hell freezes over, you gon' put me on your playlist
At one time I had the underground in my hands
I let you have it for a sec, now I'm back in demand
No need to say my name, you already know who I am
And I'm rollin through your town like a horse into the city of Troy
All this fake thug shit, got me really annoyed
You claim you a man, but in reality
Like Tom Hanks in that movie _Big_, you're really a boy
Give this kiddie a toy - to you label distributors that fronted on my music
Eat a fat one, go sign the bullshit that's diluted
I'm back, like Freddie, with an LP I hope you're ready
for Alkaline 'n' Acid, the combination's deadly

Yeah, what I told you man
Hehe, this album is crazy
Yo matter of fact I'ma stop, I'ma stop rhymin
I'ma let my son spit

[Pumpkinhead's son babbles for 13 seconds]

[Pumpkinhead]
And that's better than half y'all niggaz that's puttin records out right now
We serious right now, that's rainin right there
SoulSpazm, "Orange Moon Over Brooklyn," c'mon</pre>
