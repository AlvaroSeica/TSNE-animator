Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Intro: Big Sean] + (Wale)
Gotta work (slight work, light work)
D-Town to the DMV (slight work; Diplo wassup)
Probably got your girl going crazy
(Drunk white bitches)

[Interlude: sample of The Go! Team's "The Power Is On"] {w/ first X over Intro}
Work it, work it
Work, wo-wo-work it, oh
Work it, work it
Work, wo-wo-work, o-o-o-oh

[Wale]
I can do it all and it ain't no problem
Ain't nobody harder than that nigga Folarin
Bitch I go hard, Im ballin Im globe trotting
And my flow art my nigga, Im Mozart with it
Its all good, I do this
I turn a straight prude bitch into a nudist
Foolish I be on that new shit
And Im blowing up like bitches we went to school with
Ain't nobody checking for your garbage
Lot of intuition I ain't even finish college
Never hit the mall and forever get it all
Any broad better layer like Im dressing for the fall, nigga
And Im all that, hit the passenger door
Shawty was Pinkberry sweet and I ain't lactose
I ain't tryna brag tho, Im just know Im that dope
Kick game Bo Jacks, my Bo Jacks Tai Bo
Haha, and it ain't no problem
You race to these broads, I relay em, baton em
Bitches in here, one thou
But when you step out why the bitches run out
Double MG shit I put the set down
Rick James back, bad bitches on the couch
Ahh, wordplay, Olubowale my first name
I think Im Koko B. Ware, you just a bird babe
I got a pair of Js, I roll a pair of Js
We up in Diamond supply, spending that carrot cake
Let it marinate, you forever late
A million home sellers couldnt find a real estate

[Chorus: Wale] {w/ Interlude being repeated over Chorus 2 times}
Slight work, its light work
The wrong drink, the right work
Slight work, light work
The wrong drink, the right work
Work, work, work, work (work it out, work it out, work it out, don't stop) {*3X*}
Work, work, work, it out (work it out, work it out, uhhhhhh...)

[Big Sean]
Bitch you ain't a boss til you cut a fuckin' pay check (whoa)
Only thing between me and your bitch is latex
Man, and I ain't into saving these hoes (what)
My nigga tell me where you see a cape at
B-I, B-I, bitch B-I-G (B-I-G)
The two things I dont need are you and my ID (haha)
Imma need a yellow cab and a yellow bad bitch
Green faces but a nigga dodging yellow badges, wooop 
{*sirens*} Cause Im drunk, (yeah, ok)
Under 25 living the fucking life
White America said Ill be doing 25 to life
And just for that, Ima blow 25 tonight (do it)
You make 25 a year, I make 25 a night, whoa
Blocka, blocka, blocka (blocka)
Bitch get hit with my Ciroc Vodka choppa (go)
Takin body shots, blocka, blocka, blocka 
Probably in your girls dreams, probably in your daughter locker
Top floor like Im out tanning (whoa)
And they stole your whole delivery, now that's outlandish
I guess like a delivery man, Im out-standing, car tinted
Im in it, til like Im out camping, goddammit
Im one hell of a guy
Looking down on a cloud, that's one hell of a high (whattup doe)
Bitch, I gets ghost, the way she screaming Big
Niggas couldnt tell if I was dead or alive (hm-mmm)

[Chorus] {w/ Interlude being repeated over Chorus 2 times}

[Outro: Wale] + (Big Sean)
