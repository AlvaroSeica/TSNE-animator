Typed by: AZ Lyrics

How'd you know
Cuz I was there
Yeah that shit go
Came prepared
Set it slow rolled
Anticipation grow slow
Deviated septum blow hole
Sugar cane ko ko
Aye, aye, pass the dro my way
Or no way twenty fo no 25-8
Thought you knew
Suicide lane
Fuck you

Grab my crotch, what's my name
Been round the block
Hangin' scumbag slangin'
Pay dirt cave in
Takin' no prisoners
No escapin' wash brain hook
Nothin' I'm sayin'
Aye, aye, know what I'm sayin'

I got the diamonds, scrapin'
Sidin', wastin' my life
In altered states dem
Back it up
{*2X*}

I got the fever {*4X*}

Sprayin' execution witch fingernails clawin' through dem
Crawlin' through dem
Tunnels loosin'
Touch with everything I'm doin'
Aaarrrggghh... mass confusion
Can't make more electrocution

Half cocked full tilt
Rabid dog
Filth aarrrggghhh
Know what I'm sayin'
F*ck it
Upside down in a
Soft top bucket
Screamin'
Shred it

I got the diamonds, scrapin'
Sidin', wastin' my life
In altered states dem
Back it up
{*2X*}

I got the fever {*4X*}

Let me off, screeching halt
Concussion blinding
Not my fault
Ankles tied to cinder blocks
Aye, aye

By any means necesserated
Blade cut me
Sewer drain grated
Bubonic plague
Spreaded faceless
Lurking in the deadest spaces
On your knees, black goat anus
Christo anti clan of shameless
Came to whip those
Into shapeless
Here we go, devastated
Here we go..

Diamonds scrapin' the marrow, out my core
Who's in the mirror
Who's at the door
Someone's there
Wasn't there before
Ceiling connected
To the chord
Pull it, pull that shit

I got the diamonds, scrapin'
Sidin', wastin' my life
In altered states dem
Back it up
{*2X*}

I got the fever {*4X*}</pre>
