Song:   Make It Home
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Pour out a little liquor
Kick it with the homies
Tell a couple stories to the people
Who don't know me
Put on break and bad that's my favorite show
Play my old mixtapes on the radio
Take care of my sister give my truck to pops
He always told me that he loves this whip a lot
Bury me in secret I don't need a lot of people
It's crazy when your gone everybody wanna see you
Tell my Granny that I love her my momma that I miss her
Really really miss her I would give anything to kiss her
Tell my ex girlfriend I love the old her
If I don't make it home tonight
Tell the city that we maejor my label that I'm sorry
Really really sorry woulda made some millions probably
Tell all of my haters that they finally get their wish
If I don't make it home tonight
Sip a little henny do it how I did it
Get it how I got it
How I did when I was living
Ya'll could have the crib and a benz I ain't tripping
You been there since the beginning you my brother don't forget it
And ell my little cousins keep believing you can make it
So tudy and be patient one day you will be the greatest
To them People who believe in me that I appreciate it
Tell brian he should cancel all my scheduled engagements
Granny that I love her momma that I miss her
Really really miss her I would give anything to kiss her
Tell my ex girlfriend I love the old her
If I don't make it home tonight
Tell the city that we maejor my label that I'm sorry
Really really sorry woulda made some millions probably
Tell all of my haters that they finally got their wish
If I don't make it home tonight

Granny that I love her momma that I miss her
Really really miss her I would give anything to kiss her
Tell my ex girlfriend I love the old her
If I don't make it home tonight
Tell the city that we maejor my label I'm sorry
Really really sorry woulda made some millions probably
Tell all of my haters that they finally get their wish
If I don't make it home tonight</pre>
