[INTRO - Saukrates] (background "studio niggas")
My time to shine, now.  I got the floor now
(Okay, alright.  Go man)
Let me take conrol.  A lot of niggas, a lot of niggas out here don't believe 
that, you know, that what I say is worth you know, I guess my weight in 
gold.
(I hear you, I hear you.  Nah, hell no man, they can't do that man)
Even though I am who I am and I stay where I stay.  you know it don't make 
one motherfucking difference, 'cause I'mma bring it to ya the same way 
another niggas gonna bring it to ya.  I'm just as hungry as you.  Even 
though, you know what, say it after me, even though I am who I am.
(Even though I am what I am)
I am (I am)
Somebody (Somebody)
You know waht I'm saying, and that somebody gonna put a brick in ya ass.  
Just check it out.

[Saukrates] (background "studio niggas")
Don't believe for a second, a man running ain't
A man gunning for you, true, indeed
Love is worth more that gold, but fairs equally sold
To counterparts and enemies, ya feel me?
Non-believers try another theory
But when you fail it's apparent that you didn't hear me, HA
You feel me? Take a second, fuck a first impression
We all realize longivity's a dangerous weapon
Wait a minute, are we forgetting we are MCs
Putting two to your cranium, often temps me
I'mma let it go, why? (can't touch us, can't touch us)
It don't get much straighter than this (can't touch us, can't touch us)
Love got me positive (can't touch us, can't touch us)
Ya mafucking right son (can't touch us, can't touch us)
Black man, black woman coming together
For love, life, uhh, pleasure
Guess again, when it's back to community chest again
Government cheese, starting to taste fresh again
Ain't it, nah for real ain't it, who cares if this shit's tainted
We die every second and got more where that came from
Right? Wrong, I ain't preaching
Just releasing information non-believers dare to use
Now this love become fair to you
What? Your screw face got me thinking I ain't clear to you
Let me guess, you must have question
First and foremost, who the fuck this nigga think he testing
Follow me now, this situation going down
I don't care, you will respect my name through love or fair
Niggas call me voice of reason, touch me, trust me
If I had a nickel for everytime I be lucky
If I didn't jump a tax bracket
Bullet proof jackets don't come with warentee covering heat I practice
Ya feel me? In particular I shine at the rhyme
Saukrates is the name, one more time if you forgot
I'mma let it go, why? (can't touch us, can't touch us)
It don't get much straighter than this (can't touch us, can't touch us)
'Cause love got me positive (can't touch us, can't touch us)
This idealistic speach go yo all on crutches
I am the new ambassador for rap lords
If I'm speaking out of turn, it's what you asked for
Question from me to you, what wouuld you rap for?
If you prefer the fast life running from task force
Hmm, think about, but never doubt it
I am a role model living with it never without it
My mental never getting clouded
But I admit in the beginning it was crowded
Huh, so now I spit in the ears of those who listen
Catholic, Jewish, Muslim and Christian
An Atheist combine my system
Voltron with the izm coming with one wisdom
To never attack, react to those who pissed them
OFF, do what you ought but realize the cost
'Cause time is money, people and we are running short
I'm attempted to abort procedure
But if I leave, the minority picket be "Sauk's we need ya"
Black man to forbbiden diva
I'm transmitting on your AM/FM and shortwave receiver
Try to tune out, even the negative cool out
Eviction notice on the door of ignorance, MOVE OUT!
Before I let it go son (can't touch us, can't touch us)
It don't get much straighter than this (can't touch us, can't touch us)
'Cause love got me positive (can't touch us, can't touch us)
Image is nothing when I come busting
Love may become fear, why? (alright, alright, alright)
Because I am (I am)
Somebody (somebody)
(better get your motherfucking, better get your head right man)
CIRCLE (ZOO!)
(Better look in the mirror baby an tell me what the ugly thing you see back 
there baby)
Capitol Hill
(Tell me what you see in the mirror.  A sorry ass, pussy ass motherfucker)</pre>
