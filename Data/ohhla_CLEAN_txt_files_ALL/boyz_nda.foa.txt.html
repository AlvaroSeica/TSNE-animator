[Scragg Lee]
I got more styles than your mother's got cheese
And 25 ways to kill a sucker MC
Now I'ma do it big motherfucker you'll see
So I don't give a damn talk shit about me
Cause the Boyz N Da Gump are always hard
You comin talkin that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy cause I ain't said shit yet

You got a problem with me? Then I got a problem with you
You got a couple choices of what you can do
It's not a tough decision as you can see
I can blow you away or you can ride with me
You better ride with me cause I can get you to the border
The P's after me from what I did to his daughter
I did her like this, I did her like that
I did her with the wiffleball bat, soooooooo

I ride around town, '88 Camry
No radio and my tank's on E (D-DJ Frank White!)
No AC but I got plenty heat
So you can have everything that my parents bought me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Cause the Boyz N Da Gump are always hard
You comin talkin that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy cause I ain't said shit yet</pre>
