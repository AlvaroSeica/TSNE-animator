Song:   Kill Your Idols
Typed by: PremRock 

Ayo my favorite crew ain't coming with it
So let's get uninhibited, imbibing getting live libation every line written
The time signature, time shifting, rhyme different approach
My idols did dope, sniff coke or living broke?
I know, its all up for debate so I rummage through crates
not to replicate the mistakes
I put my plan into shape attempt to handle the weight
Dismantle fate until the outcome is something I would create
I'm like Ewing... I put my sweat in the garden
Come back a couple months then I check  for the Harvest....
Just being honest, ah, just being Markus
It takes a lot in this world to be accomplished 
Na... na na na
I kill my idols everyday
Crossed out with Sharpie sharp wit, now a dull blade 
Dark days, how they gone astray
Dog gone it they became what they hated an that is part of decay
While they're trying to pay the rent...Not saving the day and gone is the cape..
But I don't sit and harbor the rage 
I'm not mad...
Im just sayin'
Kill your Idols Y'all I'm not playing

The sooner you kill your idols the quicker you grow 
So get em up, get em up and let em go
Because my favorite crew ain't coming with it 
My favorite Author is dead
Just let em' go and learn to walk on the ledge. 

Because my favorite crew ain't coming with it
The uninspired and done with it
Like a failing Catholic marriage nobody gonna admit it
Due to embarrassment I guess
So you keep it dragging on 
unpleasant and so far from fresh
This ain't genre specific
This ain't that bring back boom-bap chronological bitchin'
This ain't for the heartbroken not for the hardcore
This ain't me trying eulogize any kind of artform
This is that, free ya rhyme, read the signs
Own your space
Act like you own the place 
Fuck playing it safe
Put your idols back in the crates
Form your own fate 
Grow into your own face
Nah...
I never lived on a soap box
I don't preach, go ahead drunk and blow spots
Call that dude that's been staring a punk
Make a sculpture out of junk
Fuck it... do what you want

Chorus 2X

My favorite Author is dead
I'm screaming off with his head
I'm Freein' off of the head
Talk him off of the ledge
Id' rather walk on the edge
Sit and talk with the dead
You can talk with the heads 
And try to change up the past
Talk about what could've been, should've been
in your raps
I'm flipping' off fate while I'm walking my own path
Theres a reason you exist write till you bleed form the wrist
And when you're done look back and say it was me in this bitch!</pre>
