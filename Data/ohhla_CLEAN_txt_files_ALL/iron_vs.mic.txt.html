[Iron Mic]
I ain't, keeping it real, nigga, I'm keeping it Ruthless
We the best in the world, nigga, so fuck what you think
It's out turn, the rest of ya'll fall back
Fucking popcorn artists, ya man, he ain't all that
And nine times out of ten, your man, he ain't gon' clap
I spit facts, not just cuz it sound nice in my rap
I won't let him catch me sleeping, homey, trust me I'm holding
So have ya gun, when you creep up on me
I see ya snake eyes, it ain't hard to peep a phony
So if a nigga test me, that mean a nigga don't know me
He don't know how the Ruthless nigga really feel
He don't know this Ruthless nigga will really kill
Murdering shot, you don't know how it really feel
But the Bastardz of might had, get shot or get stabbed
Then run up in ya lab, coming for ya cash
Call my younging for torture, put the plungers to ya ass, nigga
It's not a game, nigga, I won't change for the fame
Like these fake killas, my shit is way realer
Blood stains on the concrete, we paint pictures
Hundred mile an hour shots, but we ain't pitchers
All I do is make hits, I'm a DH hitter
So call me up when it's time to score
Call me up when you need a nigga to bang the four
Or when you wanna lock donw the block and supply the raw
Nigga, I keep it Ruthless, I don't run to the law

[Bless]
Yo, you make me laugh, yo, pa, don't get ya shit split
The Bastardz is back in this back, mic check? Check this
Any nigga wanna step up? Get his head popped off
And drug like skelly tops on the floor
The general, and you know I'mma pop off
Photographers, ya'll better catch these flicks
Ruthless, lock it like Kunta chains on yo ankles
I thank you, for letting us in the club to shank you
Or catch you outside, here muthafucka, take two
I wish they would...</pre>
