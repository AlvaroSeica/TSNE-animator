ARE YOU READY?? (YEAH!!)

Alright, here we go!

[Intro: Torae]
Hey yo, Pooh, nigga
You already know what it is, dunn
 Word up (Yeah!!)
Fuck around and turn my hat backwards or something, nahmean?
Workin my Chapstick, nigga

[Torae]
Uh, here we go again, back to that goin in
Pen the repeat offender, you rap niggaz know what it IS!

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Or what it was, no buzz
It's a million motherfuckers workin just like us

[Torae]
But they don't spit it like us, makin shit like us
Lot of copycat rappers couldn't get it like us

[Rapper Big Pooh]
And we don't speak like y'all, we ain't weak like y'all
Take them training wheels off and you bound to fall
We down by law, y'all CB4

[Torae]
But they don't see these bars, lot of weaklings, god
Whenever we record, niggaz see we raw
They know T-T raw, anything he score
Like MJ in the fall, this shit bang in the Porsche
My shit, bang on the porch, the more awesome record
in this side of the board, this is how I destroy
You a coward to +Crooked I+ and any +House+ I'ma +Slaughter+

[Chorus: cuts and scratches by DJ Flash]
"Y'all don't want no war with us"
