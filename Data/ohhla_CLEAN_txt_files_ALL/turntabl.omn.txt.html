Typed by: iamomni dot com

turntable destroyer, robotic recorder
number one importer, low rider supporter
bass heavy and ready, turn me up in the chevy
take it slow on the corner, let me holla at freddy
its been a while since I seen ya, still keeping it funky
sipping on brass monkey, with your mind on your money
well I know that's right, well baby get on then
I'm trying to get fucked up with a good old friend
it was me, my nigga mole, black silver and tone
in the mutha fuckin' zone smoking california grown
throw a yicken the bone
all my shit is legit, now I'm fully equipped in my new nike fit
shine up my new kicks, decorate my wrist
everybody in this mutha fucka' know what time it is</pre>
