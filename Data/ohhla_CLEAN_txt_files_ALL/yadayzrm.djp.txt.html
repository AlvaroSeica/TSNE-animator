[Intro]:
Now ladies and gentlemen it's my pleasure to bring to you somebody that's for the real people!

[DJ Premier]:
AH! AH! AH! AH! AH!

[DJ Premier Scratchin]: (Panchi)
N! Y! G! (REMIX!!!)
It's most still in my everyday life
Ya-Ya-Ya-Ya days are numbered ("Kool G. Rap")
St-St-St-St-Stand tall stick your chest out boy, and be a man ("Nas")
Ya-Ya-Ya days are numbered ("Kool G. Rap")
Ne-Ne-Ne-Nevertheless ("O.C.")
It's most still in my everyday life

[Verse One: Shabeeno]
Same fifty nine fifties on the same three sixties
Ain't shit changed, +new team, same game+
Back to another one I said get used to us
Thought it was a game, this time we got a crew with us
Wipe my Tim's on the welcome mat
Kick in the door like I knew, I excel in rap
Go 'head, nigga rock this a warnin shot
All that's gonna stop, when Pro's and Con's drop

[Verse Two: Panchi] (DJ Premier Scratchin)
(Ya-Ya-Ya days are numbered-"Kool G. Rap") Not me I'm fine
That's reference to y'all niggas can't you see my grind
I put it all together, the way that I shine
With Freddie Foxxx, Lady Of Rage and Royce 5'9
Oh pardon me, Brother Malcolm, I'm straight from the X
These niggas rappin for the lames y'all I rep for the rest
All I had to make one phone call and I did it
Yo Preme scratch the hook and plus we shitted

[Chorus: DJ Premier Scratchin] (DJ Premier)
Ya-Ya-Ya days are numbered ("Kool G. Rap") 
St-St-St-St-Stand tall stick your chest out boy, and be a man ("Nas")
Ya-Ya-Ya days are numbered ("Kool G. Rap")
Ne-Ne-Ne-Nevertheless ("O.C.")
It's most still.......(Rock on, wit yo' bad self come on!!!)

[Verse Three: Lady Of Rage]
Hah, ayy boom shaka-laka, yo here comes the chief rocka
Rage out the gate goin straight for the knockout
You can't handle the lyrical damager
I got porn star stamina, breathe easy, you amateurs
Are more action, no lights, no cameras
No ball, I been known to kill the bull like a matador
Â¡Ole! Hah, uck-fay ou-yay
You thinkin I can't flow that? You can get the bozack
Act like you know that, I'm one of the coldest
I'm smokin like Calvin Broadus chokin on green foliage
Got a, +Bone+ to pick with all those that hate
Because I gets +Bizzy+ like +Krayzie+ and +Layzie+
You +Wish+ you can fade me, but my +Thugs+ stay +N Harmony+
It's no harmin me, I drops bombs with ease
With these NYG'z, makin N.Y. freeze
I'm still +Unfucwitable+ trick, you know my steez!

[Chorus: DJ Premier Scratchin] (Freddie Foxx a/k/a Bumpy Knuckles)
Ya-Ya-Ya days are numbered ("Kool G. Rap") 
St-St-St-St-Stand tall stick your chest out boy, and be a man ("Nas")
(We got these six spinners on these dudes man)
Ya-Ya-Ya days are numbered ("Kool G. Rap")
Ne-Ne-Ne-Nevertheless ("O.C.")
It's most still my everyday life 
(Yeah! Six shooters spinners! Word!)
Ya-Ya-Ya days are numbered ("Kool G. Rap") 
St-St-St-St-Stand tall stick your chest out boy, and be a man ("Nas")
(They tryin to figure out, what the voice is?)
Ya-Ya-Ya days are numbered ("Kool G. Rap")
Ne-Ne-Ne-Nevertheless ("O.C.")
It's most still my everyday life
(It's Bumpy Knuckles nigga!!! Yo! Check it!)

[Verse Four: Freddie Foxxx a/k/a Bumpy Knuckles]
Your days are numbered like the calendar
White potato on the Derringer with duct tape to make a silencer
Pretty much, it's a wrap if I'm involved
Clap with the revolver, strap how I resolve
Beef can be dissolved, quick as I evolve
Lyrically, like a real emcee is what I'm called
Y'all niggaz can't talk about guns to me
If you ain't never smelt saltpeter comin from assault heaters
I know you lookin for your Wikipedia
Tryin to find what the hell Bump is feedin ya
Y'all see the duffle bag carryin the muffled Mac, magazine
Filled with the hollow point Al Green's
Full of fire, I got verses for hire
They got hearses for hire - Y'ALL know that the style mean!
I'll leave ya weezin in the alley with a Walkman on
Playin Lil' Weezy, tryin to breathe easy {*gasp*}

[Chorus: DJ Premier Scratchin] (DJ Premier)
Ya-Ya-Ya days are numbered ("Kool G. Rap") 
(YEAH! YEAH! YEAH! YEAH!)
Stand-St-St-Stand-Stand tall stick your chest out boy, and be a man ("Nas")
Ya-Ya-Ya days are numbered ("Kool G. Rap")
Ne-Ne-Ne-Nevertheless ("O.C.")
It's most still my everyday life (5'9!!!)
Ya-Ya-Ya days are numbered ("Kool G. Rap") (NYG'Z!!!) 
St-St-St-St-Stand tall stick your chest out boy, and be a man ("Nas")
Ya days are numbered ("Kool G. Rap")
Ne-Ne-Ne-Nevertheless ("O.C.")
It's most still my everyday life

[Verse Five: Royce Da 5'9]
Yeah! Yeah! Nick Nine got the whole entire scene shook
Heads bop, fans watch, cops, fiends look
I'm sittin on my throne lookin like a King should
I let my record talk for me like a Preme hook
I got the green foot
I kick money shit so much it's funny shit with cream how things look
Bottom line I'm a dollar sign
Out of sight, out of mind, idolized, I'm already automized
Signature's dotted lines, zero's surrounded by my heroes
I'm livin but, honored by a mural
(Yes!) Lock load, dispense, never at my expense
Sawed off, frequent, y'all bought, we spent
Y'all resent, dog we vexed, we wet niggas with the three tek's
Reflex, respect, a real nigga from the D on the rise
With them D's on arrive, with them G'z from N.Y.
And that's why.......

[Chorus: DJ Premier Scratchin]
Ya-Ya-Ya-Ya days are numbered ("Kool G. Rap")
St-St-St-St-Stand tall stick your chest out boy, and be a man ("Nas")
Ya-Ya-Ya days are numbered ("Kool G. Rap")
Ne-Ne-Ne-Nevertheless ("O.C.")
It's most still in my everyday life</pre>
