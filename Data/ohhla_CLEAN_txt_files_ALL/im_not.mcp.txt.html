(Missing you)

I ain't missing you at all

You thought you was a pimp, or should I say The Mack
Your specialty was jumpin in the sack
That gave me the choice: either hang or leave ya
I didn't think twice, I said see ya
Stepped with a high step, not lookin back
Mama didn't raise a fool, and that's a fact
Now I'm laughin at what you took me through
And by the way, yo, I ain't missing you

(Missing you)

I ain't missing you at all

I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you

Me, missing you? Picture that
Since I stepped I haven't thought about turning back
I don't miss your kiss, or even your embrace
To put it blunt, I don't want to see your face
My thoughts of you, well, they're in the trash
With your picture, oh yeah, I kept the cash
The sun is shining now that we're through
And by the way - yo, I ain't missing you

(Missing you)

I ain't missing you at all

I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you at all

Hello? Oh, it's you, what do I owe this call?
No thanks, I ain't missing you at all
I been doing things to satisfy me
Cause I'm young and single, underline the 'free'
Enjoying life since you're not around
Peaches is too young to be tied down
Well I'm outta here, thanks for the call
And by the way - yo, I ain't missing you at all

(Missing you)

She ain't missing you
She ain't missing you
She ain't missing you
She ain't 
She ain't
She ain't missing you
She ain't missing you at all</pre>
