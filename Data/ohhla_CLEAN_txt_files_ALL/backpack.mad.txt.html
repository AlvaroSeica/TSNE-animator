Man #2:     "Right now in my backpack is a laptop, four records
                  One of them is +Peter Piper+ 12"

Woman #1: My iPod, my wallet, my lipstick

(Break it down)

[Verse 1 - Skillz]
B.I.G. never had one, but Kanye did
But he misplaced his soon as he got rich
Puff had one way before he became Diddy
Used to see him all the time out in New York City
Q-Tip rocked his live on Arsenio
Buckshot was the first one to put his in a video
MC Serch dropped a flow with his on his back
On the last episode of Yo! MTV Raps
I'm on topic, I rocked it when it wasn't that cool
I'm grown homes but it look like I'm goin to school
And as far as accessories, they second to none
Every DJ in the world done had his records in one
When you in the club with one, you might get stares
Could tell a lot about a person by what's in theirs
All kinds of lines, all kind of designs
And I ain't sure what's in yours, but my dreams are in mine
See the music I make, has a certain sound
It's not pop, so they like to call it underground
Can't separate music, it's good or it's not
Cause if Mariah was on this shit, this shit'd be pop
Now under me's beneath, like Keg and Over
When you think the underground, you prone to think it's lower
But ain't nothin low about this, my dreams is high
I believe that if you reach, then you can touch the sky
So, get on your grind and let your mind get to it
Put your time into it and you could probably do it
And they say that all I make is backpack music
Well I say "hey, all they make is whack, crap music"
New Era and I'm about to school ya
Yeah I got a backpack, but don't let that fool ya
Cause this one here, been to all kind of places
I've been had Skillz, so I'm destined for greatness
Y'all do what you do, I'm a stay on my grind
I ain't sure what's in yours, but my dreams are in mine
And the game done changed, so recognize the signs
I ain't sure what's in yours, but my dreams are in mine
Y'all do what you do, I'm a stay on my grind
I ain't sure what's in yours, but my dreams are in mine
Uh, matter fact, Dre run that back
