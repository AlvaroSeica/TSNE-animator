[Mister Wilson]
It was just an ordinary day in the city
'til these four Robot Masters came out of nowhere
They started destroying everything on sight
Scaring all the civilians
One of the robots was about to blast a bus with civilians on it
But a mysterious blast stopped it from doing that
It was Proto Man to the rescue
Proto Man asked for all their names - he wanted answers
The female robot started talking
She said she goes by the name of Rose Woman
And she introduced the others as Knuckles Man, Tails Man, and Shadow Man
She explained how they worked for Dr. Eggman and Dr. Wily
There goal was to help destroy Sonic and Mega Man on sight
and help to destroy the universe
After Rose Woman explained everything
they just magically disappeared
So random! Maybe Rose Woman spoke too much
Don't know
Proto Man is really not familiar with this town at all
He definitely wanted answers
He's thinking... maybe if he finds Mega Man
he will have some type of answers
So the search begins - Blur Bomber
