[Verse One]
My people make amazing music for Mok to flow with
I get hit with something phat just when I'm feeling I got no gift
To give the world, unbound, it all gets turned around
I've earned a firm place in this with the permasound
Ever been around a winning sound without even knowing?
It's the story of my career, sometimes, now I'm grinnin', owing
Slim pickings dumb, became a little bit plumper
And when she started showin' attitude I was like, "No problem if I dump her."
Stroll down the corridors of this industry wards
With more knowledge of how to gain more
So eat my shorts
I peep my ports
I gotta be across the country in four hours
Hit the fo-tel
Go tell my folks I'm here
Smoke some beer
Drink some herb and all that wild stuff that stars do
The only difference is, integrity out the ass and I'm stayin' true
And you better be flexible partner
If I'll be payin' you
I feel a bit nervous, I got some prayin' to do
Man, ain't I just an oddity to outshine the moon?
With quality and quantity to fill your afternoon
Drivin' around in headphone while I'm in a coffee saloon
Puttin' mo' good stuff down, feelin' the urge to croon

[Chorus] [x2]
My world got such a wild variety to choose from
Things can be so good, you'd wonder where I'd get the blues from
But things can get so bad I feel like good won't return 'em
I'm a basket case with fantastic taste at a drastic pace

[Verse Two]
Okay Monday was cool
I woke up, I read the paper
I rolled downtown, and looked around and got naked
Tuesday was chill
I sold tapes on the corner
Hit up the radio station and dropped a little promo
Wednesday was tight
Blockbuster night and long distance
Calls on the phone with operator assistance
My Thursday was bumpin'
Made love for six hours straight
Then grabbed my cans and painted freight trains till late
Friday was grand with my arch in my hand
Recorded more damn songs than I can humanly stand
Saturday was sleep day
Sunday, L.A. baby
Rent me a Bentley and pretended I'm in the Navy
See what I mean?
You ain't gotta be so one dimensional
I rap with a gentle flow
I chill where the lentils grow
And implement my senses for that old foresight
And indulge in more travels and food and more mics

Cause I gotta get around
Gots to get around
I gotta fill up my life with alllll that, all that good stuff in the promise land.

[Chorus] [x2]
My world got such a wild variety to choose from
Things can be so good, you'd wonder where I'd get the blues from
But things can get so bad I feel like good won't return 'em
I'm a basket case with fantastic taste at a drastic pace</pre>
