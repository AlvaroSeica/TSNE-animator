Typed by: jostmatt at bluewin dot ch

Lost my way, fell down a hole
No one's gonna come and save my soul
Lost my way, no goin back
I'm stuck right here, and that is that

Look around this manor and all you will see
Is ill mannered people
Iller mannered than the illest mannered person
You've ever met in your manor
Or are ever likely to meet
In any manor, cause this manor's deep
You judge them on the life that they lead
But then it's not all as black and white as it seems
They're all in some way enslaved and their circumstances
Shape the way they behave in the battle on the street
That's why these kids ain't got no hope
Walkin round their estates thinkin this is it
They ain't ever gettin out and it's no joke
Probably is the best of life they're ever gonna get
They don't believe they can succeed
Or the opportunities you say are there really exist
Cause they been told every day from the minute they were born
By their fucked up parents that they ain't shit
Mum and dad never made nothing of themselves
Nah, so why the hell are they gonna?
School's a waste of time, they're only gonna fail
Their older brother went to jail, why ain't they gonna?
I mean they hang with thugs, they sell drugs
Ain't afraid to put a couple of slugs in you if you say somethin
They aren't all that way but you don't care either way
To you they're all the same, just a bunch of fuckin

Youths that are out everyday
Workin for the devil's pay
The young souls that went astray
Listen and you hear them say

Lost my way, fell down a hole
No one's gonna come and save my soul
Lost my way, no goin back
I'm stuck right here, and that is that

God said, 'Let there be light', created Adam and Eve
Then He gave 'em eyes and told them both to believe
In something they would never actually physically see
Then the devil came along and planted a seed
And doubt started growin from the ground like trees
Right up to the sky so profoundly seen
To be the only thing in this life that wasn't a dream
Made from stone, steel and iron beams
The council blocks, they're defiantly mean
And bullied the sky so everybody could see
Some birds are caged and will never be free
And gradually people began to change their beliefs
Until God was nothing more than just a fictional bein
The worship of money merged all colours and creed
Into one true religion that was driven by greed
Corporate machines tryina sell you shit you don't need
On the television and the ad breaks in between
Until people only cared about material things
Not lives of other fellow human beings
And I'm guilty of it too, or so it seems
I've

Lost my way, fell down a hole
No one's gonna come and save my soul
Lost my way, no goin back
I'm stuck right here, and that is that

If you don't believe if something then you'll fall for anything
(And if that happens then you've lost your way)

Don't believe if something then you'll fall for anything
Fall for anything, fall for anything</pre>
