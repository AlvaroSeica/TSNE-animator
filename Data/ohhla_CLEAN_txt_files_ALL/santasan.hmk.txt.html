[Intro/Chorus: repeat 4X]
"Like a vampire in a horror movie"

[Ill Bill]
My discipline go beyond the way the army train people, calmly spray people
Devil's horns up like Ronnie James Dio or Tony Iommi
Cut your fuckin arms off, stole me a roadie
I'm +Mobb Deep+ like Tony Mulroney
Cross between the Egyptian God of Fire
E'ry time I ride ten times higher than a soprano in God's choir
A Heavy Metal King, like eatin crack on gun metal ring
Settle things like God's prayer and the Devil's wings
We feast at the Last Supper, you hear the last laugh from us
Scrape cash abundant, you hear the gats blast from us
Roll with meaner rhymes, pinnin y'all
Conquer continents like Genghis Khan
My life is like a Misfits song
or like Cypress Hill, "Hits From the Bong"
or like Ice-T, "6 'N the Morn," police at my door
Shoot the beast in his horse
Squeezin the four, creep in the 6, then breeze to L'amour
The Lords of War, for four seasons or more, listen

[Chorus]

[Vinnie Paz]
This is goon music, somethin for Vinnie gun to clap
Y'all ain't makin no progress, y'all still are runnin laps
I think of y'all like Christ, y'all never comin back
Chainsaws and husky bears without the lumberjacks
Come on Pana! Vinnie got a clip full
I'mma let this four-fifth bark like it's a pitbull
(BRRAP! BRRAP! BRRAP!) Money I got a fistful
And I got an razor and it cut like if you skip school
I can be on that fight the power, astonish shit
I can be on that Gucci and on that Prada shit
I can be on that questionin if a God exists
I can be on that punch in your face and rob you shit
That's when motherfuckers starvin and such
Dry snitchin, all y'all motherfuckers cryin too much
Yeah, give me a jar and the Dutch
I just caught a body and I'm proud of all this rhymin and such
Yeah

[Chorus]

[Vinnie - over Chorus]
Yo Lethal, we did it again baby
20 years later, still bangin 'em in the fuckin head
