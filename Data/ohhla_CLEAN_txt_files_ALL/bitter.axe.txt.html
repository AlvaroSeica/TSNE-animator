[Long Axe]
She might appear to be that heart attack waiting to happen
Taking it back rapping
She had plans, life in her hands
Chose to sex women instead of her own man
Holding a grown man, her mind was lie mush
Had a rainbow logo tatted on her butt
A crush on ____, didn't like Doms
Baggy ass jeans and had big ass arms
This was Lisa abused as a teen
Raped by her uncle, an undercover dope fiend
I wish she could talk about it y'all
She thought herself choking
Why did you have to tear up my life with that sexual knife
Kept stabbing, kept grabbing
Slamming the force in, the portion
Childhood riddled with drug and abortion
Thoughts were cold and then boiling
And kept pouring
'Suicidal Thoughts', no Biggie, happened so often
Baby it happened so often

[Long Axe]
Then she grew nasty hot in the past
Jeans were steady bulging, waving her hand
Digging her man, about twice what her age is
Acting like a mistress taken through the stages
First he was beaten them in a hotel motel
2am, three rubbers and a blunt
Forty five minutes she tunes it all out
What she remembered was her uncle in her cunt
Maybe in the pain, she felt a little shelter
Hate was so regular, no one could help her
She was a regular to sincere niggas
From dudes that tote to totes
To dudes that tote triggers
Growing up fast lost in darkness
Can't see past the grass by her apartment
And where she watches, nowhere watch us
Out of time, out her goddamn mind

[Chorus x4: Long Axe]
This is the scene where dreams withstand life
Wind breakers that don't break in light
Home niggas that don't stay in life
Jawbreakers, bitter to the end</pre>
