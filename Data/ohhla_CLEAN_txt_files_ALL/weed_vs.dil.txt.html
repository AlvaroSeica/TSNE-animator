[ Verse One: Evidence ]
Yo, never underestimate the next man's greed
And never sell ya baseball cards for weed
I don't really get upset, so I'm not violent
The monotone microphone master, moves in silence
I'm nice off the head, and I'm nice off led
To some I'm three hours behind, to others I'm one ahead
These vocal tones symbolizes confidence mixed with home-grown
And such, no fear with the paranoide touch
I can intoxicate myself, I hate when I do that
Running around acting stupid, saying "True that!"
That ain't me, and I know this is true (Come on!)
So I just consume the grines and say fuck the brew

[ Verse Two ]
Fuck you, it was me on beering unity
Hype as fuck, aiiyo Ev' (wassup?)
leave your weed and you look stuck
Go ice-o-late yourself, while I throw some back
No action speaks louder than my words, verbal attack
Peace to Swift and Tash, they mixing beer with hash
Yo, I separate the two from experience, they clash
I trust my ways and intuition, plus the way I stear
When it's time for shows and women
Fuck the weed, just beer

[ Verse Three: Evidence ]
Never underestimate the next man's greed
And never sell ya best friend weed with seeds
I don't really place 'em peoples in no position
The monotone microphone master smokes weed and listens
I'm nice off the head, and I'm nice off led
To some I'm one hour behind, to others I'm one ahead
This vocal tone stands for chaos, and total control
Completely outta reach, but hit the potkit on a roll
I can intoxicate myself, yo maybe they past the time
Yo maybe they kill the pain when there's problems with my guilt
Yo, but that ain't me, and I know this is true
So I just consume the grines and say fuck the brew

[ Verse Four ]
On beer, I come through in the clutch
Yo, I see four suckers and blow the fuck up
Yo, go ice-o-late yourself while I throw some back
Yea, I'm dangerous as hell, with two Mooseheads in the hatch
You can talk-talk-talk, I drink up and have my fun
You be the, Jack of all trades; Master Of None
I trust my way's direction, I know the way to stear
When it's time to party down, fuck the weed, just beer</pre>
