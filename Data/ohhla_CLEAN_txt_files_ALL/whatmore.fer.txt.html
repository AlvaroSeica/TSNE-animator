{Hook 0:29}
What more can I-I-I do-o-o-o-o {can I-I-I do-o-o-o-o} {can I-I-I do-o-o-o-o}
I'm si-i-i-ick, of a-a-a-all the ne-e-ews {a-a-a-all the ne-e-ews} {a-a-a-all the ne-e-ews}  
If only I could stay with you-u-u-u-u {stay with you-u-u-u} {stay with you-u-u-u-u}
But, I'm he-e-eaded to-o-o the mo-o-o-on {to-o-o the mo-o-oon} {to-o-o the mo-o-o-on}

{Verse 1 0:51}
Its a shame how I feel, and how I want to get away
It's a shame how the world works, and how I feel today
It amazes me at times, when the suns in place
How people can be dark, in the most shady ways
It's hard to see clear, through the hate as it rains
Followed with mud, then they put dirt on your name
And even if your humble, the respect is never gained
This life that we live in, I can't even explain
I hope for the best, that another bill get paid
I'm tryna find my purpose, so every night I pray
That tomorrow be better, then the past I've made
What lies ahead, is whatever I create
You can't let opinions, turn out to be your fate
I use to extend my hand but, yet they refused to shake
One day, I know, they will, regret that mistake
They will regret that mistake {mistake}...

{Hook 2:10}
What more can I-I-I do-o-o-o-o {can I-I-I do-o-o-o-o} {can I-I-I do-o-o-o-o}
I'm si-i-i-ick, of a-a-a-all the ne-e-ews {a-a-a-all the ne-e-ews} {a-a-a-all the ne-e-ews}  
If only I could stay with you-u-u-u-u {stay with you-u-u-u} {stay with you-u-u-u-u}
But, I'm he-e-eaded to-o-o the mo-o-o-on {to-o-o the mo-o-oon} {to-o-o the mo-o-o-on}

{Verse 2 2:31}
They say you can't see if your eyes blind,
That's why I don't feel media guidelines
Blowing this weed, reading this high times
Since you can't believe everything you hear
I only focus on actions so words disappear
Anything being said, doesn't even compare
It's only in your head if you let it get through your ears 
T.v critics telling you how to live, yeah they telling you how to live 249
That's why I never liked a fox growing up as a kid
Constantly writing rhymes tellin it how it is
But, really it doesn't matter if no ones bumpin ya shit,
Teenage dreams hoping to get blessed
When many people would say that's somethin that don't exist,
Talking to myself saying somethings just gotta give {gotta give}...

{Hook 3:10}
What more can I-I-I do-o-o-o-o {can I-I-I do-o-o-o-o} {can I-I-I do-o-o-o-o}
I'm si-i-i-ick, of a-a-a-all the ne-e-ews {a-a-a-all the ne-e-ews} {a-a-a-all the ne-e-ews}  
If only I could stay with you-u-u-u-u {stay with you-u-u-u} {stay with you-u-u-u-u}
But, I'm he-e-eaded to-o-o the mo-o-o-on {to-o-o the mo-o-oon} {to-o-o the mo-o-o-on}</pre>
