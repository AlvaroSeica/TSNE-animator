[Chorus: Truck]
I hear 'em coming for me, man, they coming for me
I can't sleep at night, cuz they coming for me
More money, more problems, yes, they coming for me
I'm the talk on the street, now, they coming for me
Yes, they coming for me, man, they coming for me
I can't sleep at night, cuz they coming for me
I'm the talk on the street, now, they coming for me
More money, more problems, yes, they coming for me

[Truck]
What the fuck I'm gon do now, defend myself?
Dressed in all black, take the fucking gun off the shelf
I hear 'em coming, well let them come, cuz I was taught to get down
Where I'm from, Staten Island, that's right, pa, ain't nothing sweet out here
We starving on the streets, we gotta eat out here
24/7, seven days a week
The same clothes daily, I hardly gets no sleep
I'm on the paper chase, I move from place to place
Fiends looking for me all day, loving the bass
What you need? Dimes, twenties, 50 pieces
Hundred dollar slabs, on the real, they need this
Come through and visit, smoke weed and drink
Soon as ya ass start slipping, fuck up and think
Shit can't happen, that's when the boys from Staten
Start wilding and flipping, alotta gun clapping
Of course his clothes is nice, his jewels is hot
All I saw a nigga running, when his chain got popped
All different types of gangs on every glock
When take you on the tour, make sure ya gun is cocked

[Chorus]

[Truck]
Shit's not looking right, and the mood is strange
I sware if duke turn around, I'm throwing shots to his range
So front, he ain't saying nothing, he love flossing and stunting
Typical type that want to be loved
And money love pussy, I got some hoes for him
The freaky ones that put on fucking shoes for him
After the episode over, tie his punk ass up
Pull out ya cell phone, yea call up Truck
1-800, I show you how to rob a nigga
I ain't eat all day, and I'm starving, nigga
Send the goons to ya houses, no problems, nigga
I got, one on the couch, man, two in the closet
Where ya fucking city, pa, you can't hide in

[Chorus]</pre>
