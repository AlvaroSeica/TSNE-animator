[Intro]
Let the kids sing

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I still wish I was a kid again

[Travie McCoy]
Uh-huh; thinkin back when things were so easy
Got me laughin out loud, for no reason
I use to take them cans back and collect them nickels
Trading Garbage Pail Kid cards for sweet pickles
The whole block used to have G.I. Joe battles
Yeah your boy had the original Storm Shadow
And as of lately things have been slow
So I reminisce on when we use to break them windows
Yeah, 'til I got snatched by the cops
with a wiffle ball bat and a hand full of rocks (wasn't me)
Consider this song a throwback
Cause all I wanna do is go back, y'all sing it with me

[Chorus] - 2X

[Travie McCoy]
Tell 'em! And this was way before PlayStation
Rushing home to watch Video Vibrations
Man I tell you Sherry Carter coulda got the business
And I can't forget Rachel from Caribbean Rhythms
This was back when Rap City used to play the jams
This is how I first heard about the Wu-Tang Clan
Banged "36 Chambers" all summer long
And to this day "Can It Be"'s my favorite summer song
And I can drop names for days
of all my favorite artists who helped to pave the way
But, we probably need a lot more then just four minutes
So this is how I'm gonna end it - everybody sing

[Chorus] - 2X

[over Chorus]
C'mon! Everybody sing
Yeah, it's Travie
{?} Squad, Nappy Boy
Let's go~!

[Travie McCoy]
Yeah, I'm on the bus in the back lounge
Sweaty, cold, confused in another unfamiliar town
Another sold out show
Spillin my soul to a ton of people I don't know
And I can feel my skin wearin thinner
Fourth night, no appetite for dinner
Shit, God damn, well ain't life grand
Gettin paid to stand on stage wit'cha heart in ya hand
Sometimes I squeeze it 'til they get worried
If this is +Groundhog's Day+ I guess I'm Bill Murray
And I swear I'm not complainin at all
I love each and everyone of y'all, all I'm really sayin is

[Chorus] - 3X

[over Chorus]
C'mon! Everybody sing {*2X*}
C'mon! Yeah
Everybody sing
C'mon
Nappy Boy, it's Travie
Let's go~!</pre>
