[The Jet Age of Tomorrow]
I'm in a wonderland whenever she starts to speak...

This girl (ahh) I'm in a wonderland whenever she starts to speak
This girl (ahh) I wonder if she'll ever see something in me
Racing through my fantasy, racing through my fantasy
All I see is her and me, she's racing through my fantasy
Racing in my mind, all of the time
She's just racing through my fantasy, I see you whenever I dream

This girl (ahh) I'm in a wonderland whenever she starts to speak
This girl (ahh) I wonder if she'll ever see something in me
Racing through my fantasy, racing through my fantasy
All I see is her and me, she's racing through my fantasy
Racing in my mind, all of the time
She's just racing through my fantasy, I see you whenever I dream</pre>
