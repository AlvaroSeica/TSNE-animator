Yo, yo (Gravediggaz)
Gatekeep and Grim Reap'

{*repeating in background: "Burn baby burn, burn baby burn"*}

[Fruitkwan/Gatekeeper]
Check it, yo, yo
I was unearthed, the womb gave birth
Partitioned to submission, forced to dwell in hell's kitchen
I lived contaminated for months
Stalkin fresh was a casual hunt, peep the game
Waitin for a stray pass-byer
Grab the motherfucker burn him set him on fire
I've been insane since exchange of rings
that the docs in autops', tried to prevent to stop
Biologically I breathe, a rebel
Psychologically havin fights with the devil
Wakin up with gashes, deep river slashes
Hearin the talkin of the motherfucker burned to ashes
Scared to sleep, fearin committin a sin
Stuck my eyelid and brow with a safety pin
Feelin myself lifted yet seein myself, still sittin
Evil has become my faith - I'm slippin

{*repeating 8X: "Burn baby burn, burn baby burn"*}

[Too Poetic/Grym Reaper]
Yo, from the first day, that I burst through the skin of a virgin
I was cursed by sin
A mammal of the sea
Pops named John Samuel Berkeley, out of his nuts came me
True indeed I had soul, even as a tadpole
Grab hold of an egg, just to have a mole
Grew up surrounded by darkness and blood
Swimmin in the cut like Noah in the flood
EH AH AH AH AH!!  Drama!  Devils attack me inside my MOMMA!
This caused trauma
While I was growin up she was throwin up
It got worse - it's how I met the doc and the nurse
They took an X-ray, kept it to the next DAY
to figure out the best way to posess ME
Trapped in a pool of impurity
without security, nearly ruined me
No immunity, to the curse yet
I saw the Earth sweatin, as poppa prayed on the church step
in the place where they worship
As the nurse crept I got mad nervous

{*repeating 8X: "Burn baby burn, burn baby burn"*}

[Fruitkwan/Gatekeeper]
Tossin turnin, fightin to awake
I woke up with a scream, strapped to the stake
Blood drippin like rain, excruciatin pain
Loosin my grip; episode of "Tales From the Crypt"
Seein faces of death had me shortness of breath
Fallin through the rabbit hole that collapsed my chest
Blood spillin, inside survive like a villain
Killin life, tortorous as Vincent Prince
Tried to run got caught then I lost my tongue
Barrels of dead corpse beatin my head like a drum
Summoned to scotch your head, let's figure
They guided my light, I came back a Gravedigga
The prophet - enhanced by these deadly concoctions
Killin evil that lurk in the dirt, is our only option
Four hundred years in the pits we dwell
And for every drop of blood you will burn in hell, devil

{*repeating 8X: "Burn baby burn, burn baby burn"*}

[Too Poetic/Grym Reaper]
Yo, pain builds my character
Deranged cancer cell begin to damage my shell
Tissues begin to swell
A human pin-cushion needles begin pushin
through my, melanin color, blood begins gushin
Hunger - pain is, fed through my veins
Tryin to maintain body and brain under strain
Belly bein drained from my nose through a catheter
To maintain my stamina, game is high caliber
Flashback my dossier file before the hospital
Lots'll pay a pile of cheddar to see me rock my style
Got lots of smiles from man woman and child
A Gravedigga here runnin wild like the Nile
Ghetto, X-File, the horrorcore bringers
City morgue singers, new rap era beginners
Four years out of seven I remember tourin
And this year I'm measurin my urine
