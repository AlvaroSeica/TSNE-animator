(Song intro) 
(Girl talking) 
Yo stop driving crazy! 
(Chino) 
Shut the fuck up yo! I drive...Yo word is bond, i need a sign, yo 
I'm stopping right here till i get a sign 
(Lightning Sounds) 
(Chino) 
Look at that shit! What's that nigga? Ohh shit yo! I can't believe this... 
(Angel Speaks) 
Chino my love, although many will come before you, 
trying to be just like you, there will never be another you. 
You've traveled so far to get here. 
Don't allow the world to make you forget why. 
Our ancestors are with you, and will lead you.
Never let your mental conquer me 

(Chorus) 

Never love my enemy 
You could never take my history 
You could never block my destiny 
Never did love follow me 
And I'll never return to poverty 
Never fooled by Satan's jealousy 
Until my heaven inherits me... 

(verse 1) 
I won't lie, some nights i feel like I've been forsaken by God
victimized, plagarized like Speilberg did Amistad
He who laughs last laughs best but never again is the mantra that I cry... 
I spit like Ming the merciless, blissless bliss high risk piss 
clench fist, the massicistic sadistic from every verse on this 
Behold my serpents hair like purseus ill impossibly, 
larceny, broken velocity through lightning speed viscosity 
My philosophy, speak animosity keep shit in a bag like a colostomy 
I'm pro you're junior varsity
If "Twelve Angry Viewers" on MTV
diss my shit I'll hunt down and kill 'em all individually 
I make headlines considerably
Sorcery with no plea bargain, or jargon, or glossary
Fuck the Insane Clown Posse, of rap their making a mockery 
You'll retire like Seinfeld waiting on titles that I've held 
rockin' gold like Dennis Leary blasting assasins sent to kill me 
feel me, you take notes like court stenography, you better watch me,
I take beef personally to your villa steps like Versace 
More Colt 45's than Billy Dee, collecting disability 
I'll shoot out with Bill &amp; Hillary, still won't run out of artillery 
While you trying to make all net like Iver-son or Jor-don 
I'm extor-tin trying to make all net like Forbes to make a for-tune
Stick that ass in phone booth's, drinking 151 proof
laughing at that bitch with a gold tooth
flicking my ashes out of a sunroof 
Uncooth industry snotty and shady can't no Bible save me, 
From throwing you offmy tour bus like Bobby did Whitney &amp; baby 
Get with me? Maybe, but then be hunted 
You ain't no killer or gangster smiling 
or dancing interviewed by Teen Summit 
My multi-topical written flows containing subjects that vary, 
but still all relative like West Virginian's before they marry 
I blind you in stereo or mono i'm deluxe while you ride econo 
out of there, broke like the first host of the Vibe show 
Your wives know I fuck like 
Marky Mark on Boogie Nights while Guinessed out, 
while famous bitches give me head with Pop Rocks in their mouths 
Me dissapear? Never again, go to war with Vatican men
it'll take a whole cast of E.R. to have your ass walking again
You're an over-rated player that white fans love like DiMaggio 
You off-air like Wendy Williams, out of the air like John Denver 
till forever you remeber, i'm falling off? Never... 

(Girl Singing) 
I'm god... 4X 

(Chorus) 
Never can you stop my hostility 
Never love my enemy 
Never get me out your memory 
I am never beaten lyrically 
Never fear, go head &amp; murder me 
So my God will be right next to me... 

(Verse 2) 
I'm descending from the sky like Gabriel the arch angel 
with weight of world on shoulders like Aretha Franklin's ankles 
You liars, i'm tired of all your fake drug dealing tales 
the only time yall see grams is when yall drink them gingerales 
I hold the hammer to, your head piece flush you! like genitals 
I'll battle &amp; bring evil that'll make your priest abandon you 
Through translucent fuschia zones poems, my vocal tones are dark 
Catacombs that'll scatter domes with the phermones of old bones 
in Germany eternally my victim hemorages internally 
until the stench of decaying flesh, accompany Manson's death
If you ask, bet, i'll take your breath a diffrent aspect 
enter the lung get shredded by person to person contact 
But beyond that, any rappers death I'm behind that 
I'll get that ass touced in any jail you do time at 
In every verse ditto
My defeat, you better have more blindfolded Faith
than a kidnapped version of Biggie's widow
Kiddo, you ain't worth hospitals till im hospitable enough 
to put you inside of a hospital after i smoke critical amounts of dust 
Thus my mind spoke on Jedi pedestals and roasting demos 
semi seminals who try to test testicles of this mc's quotables 
I'll make the proudest of all Dominicans swing flags for Puerto Rico 
And kill any blanco gringo reffering to Chino as chico 
By summoning the smoldering murdering minister thats mastering mayhem 
slaying day out &amp; day in out'spoke'n like a dayton 
Rim that be keeping 'em staggering through lyrical pattern and
traveling through my abdomen unraveling 
at the speed of a javelin still reppin' Vatican 
And invade like Mexican notify next to kin cats i'm invested in 
Don't worship Christ, they worship the theives crucified next to him 
Poison men cringes, from poison pen syringes 
these niggas couldn't be stars if they were thrown by Chinese ninjas 
Chino you bring phantasm plus you G like the dwellas 
and been touched by an angel like Della, me fear y'all niggas? 
Never...</pre>
