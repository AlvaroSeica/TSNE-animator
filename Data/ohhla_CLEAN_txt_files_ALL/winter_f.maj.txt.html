Typed by: Cno Evil

[Madam Majestic]
Every winter, flowers die
Every eye has tears to cry
People ask the question 'why'...
Against the cold wind, birds must fly
Morning sun has got to lie
Windows open up your eyes...

[Chorus: Madam Majestic]
What did I prove that was wrong...
And why'd you go out of my arms?
Just - stop - leading me on...
Why don't you leave me alone...
Just - stop - leading me on...
Why don't you leave me alone...

[Madam Majestic]
How dare you call me to this day
Find someone else to stay...
If you don't see me someway...
Reflect my image... from your memories
I have just one thing to ask
Where did we go wrong?

[Chorus]

[Madam Majestic]
Every sky must come to rain
Every heart must feel some pain
People want someone to blame...
Lovers come and lovers go
If it's good, then let it go
If it ends, just let it go...
You are all I ever need...
No one can ever take your place

[Chorus]</pre>
