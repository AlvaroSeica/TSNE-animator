[mc chris]
This song goes out to all you motherfuckin bitches out there
that be thinkin some shit, fuck you motherfuckers!
Yeah, motherfuckin yeah!
Fuck yeah!

[mc chris]
I never carry a gun, I just carry my tongue
When it's not knee deep in pork it's acidic and forked
I'd mission abort, don't need no permission to start
Rip apart every synapse and spark 'til you're clutchin your heart
Playin Mario Kart with Wesley Clark
Make like Corey Hart and wear my shades when it's dark
Don't retort or remark, you'll get Dizzy G Cheeks
with a mouth full of fart {*chris makes a fart sound*}
I'm Slaughter comma Sarge, a.k.a. Commissar
Ballin like Stalin from U.S.S.R.
Shit's so fluid so far, thanks to Matt on guitar
Yo DJ, take 'em to the part where I turn rap into art

Yeah, motherfucker check this shit out

[Chorus]
I'm a badass, I ain't gonna fuckin spell it
I get up on the mic and then I fuckin yell it
No need to embellish, I'm selfishly hellish
Equatorial insect repellent, the likes of which you never dealt with
Motherfucker

[Outro]
Yeah motherfuckers!
You think I'm fuckin kiddin?
Fuck all you dicks that were givin me shit, screw you
Especially my two older brothers
I'm never gonna forgive you guys for givin me all them noogies, and wedgies
Fuck that shit, that shit wasn't cool
And all those guys in junior high that were makin fun of me
cause I got caught masturbatin at that birthday party
Fuck you guys, you guys are fuckin assholes
I hope you get cancer of the dick
And everybody in high school that makes fun of me
just cause I was too asthmatic to play ultimate frisbee
and I had to sit on the bench the whole time
And read fuckin books about Narnia, fuck you guys
And all those colleges that didn't accept me
My parents got me a tutor so I'll see you bitches next year
WORD I'M OUT!</pre>
