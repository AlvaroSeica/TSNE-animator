You know the name of every judge right?
Staying dirty like broads in mudfights.
Livin' the thug life, can't even sell your drugs right.
Eating subs lightin' up L's. You'll never swell.
Got no whip, but you got a cell phone.
Livin' to sell stones for nothin'.
Ain't stuffin' your pockets. Need to stop it.
Pump out in the rain and buy a chain with your profit.
Talkin' like you game king. 
Hollow pieces make your chain swing.
Wearin' your girl's name ring, 
always re-in' the same thing for nada.
Just gettin' hotter like an iguana.
Doing the lambada, 
acting like you took over the ?Kotta.
But still a new jack. 
Dudes lack brains, change your order.
Sure to get no place, re-in' up eighths and quarters.
Saw your stee. We bought a pound of trees, 
and you're blazin' up to put it straight.
You couldn't pump weight in a gymnasium.
You're sayin' some...
"People gotta do what I say." Maybe so...
next thing you know, 
you're askin me to shout you on the radio.
Your baby girl's, quick as hell.
While you in a pissy cell.
Lost your chick, 
now you tell yourself you wish you listen well.
Yesterday's history, tomorrow, a mystery.
Today's a gift that's why it's called the present.
Took a tip from me to get your shit together,
before it's too late. Or you may...
find yourself hangin' in your cell by your shoelace.
Get your shit together before it's too late.
Or you may...
find yourself hangin' in your cell by your shoelace.
Cuz yo...

(scratched in)
I seen your kind before, you're not original
Who you? Who you?
I seen your kind before, you're not original.
Who you? Revenge of the Herbs.
I seen your kind before you're not original.
Who you? Who you?
I seen your kind before, you're not original.
Who you? Revenge of the Herbs.

My rhymes are too hot like Kool and the Gang.
Rulin' the game. All you dudes are the same.
So I'm schoolin' your dame like, listen dame...
I'm doing my thing to make moves.
Downlow like bass tubes. Are those fake boobs?
Y'all two go together like brew with anything.
Two fools without a clue, approved for wedding rings.
Could you get a drink? It's time to go job hunting.
Stop frontin'. I'm hard as a rock as Charles Dutton.
Ma button, up your shirt. Can't work with silicone.
Rather chill at home watchin' movies get a bone,
and rub it off. No shame, it's a real man's thing.
Can't swing girl cuz you're fake like your man's ring.
Slam things off the wall. Go back to the mall.
The only thing worse than a fake dude is a fake doll.
I break y'all cuz you let me. 
I could see it in your eyes the first time you met me.
You couldn't get me with your mind.
So you had to flash your behind.
Have to remind you, body's only half of the dime.
The rest is above the neck if you want some respect.
But talk sex to Check, that's all you gonna get.
Besides a broken heart. Told ya Mark,
wouldn't play the joker. Start messin' around,
all you're gettin' is clowned.
Heard Check and Eric Brown's gettin loot for flows.
Now you assume, you can roll with the super hoes.
Ha ha. 
It's truthful though, we choose those is headstrong.
Thinkin' you can jump on the team? You're dead wrong.
Put on your best thong and your Lee press ons.
You and your ex gwan (going to)
still get dissed on Check's song. Cuz yo...
