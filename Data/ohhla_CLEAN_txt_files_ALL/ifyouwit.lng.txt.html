(And you say New York City) (yeah!)
(And you say New York City) (yeah!)
(New York, New York)
(Watch out! We run New York)
(Hook)
In Queens, Brooklyn, Bronx, Staten, Manhattan
Truck Jewels and big gats sparkin
New York New York, land of the crime inner cities
Longshots always on the grind, If You with me
Load 'em up (load 'em up)
Spit 'em out (Spit 'em out)
Round 'em up (Round 'em up)
Buck 'em down (Buck 'em down)
Throw 'em up (Throw 'em up)
Shut 'em down (Shut 'em down)
Break 'em up, Break 'em down, Roll 'em up, Roll 'em out

[Crayon]
Longshots
New York City
If you riding wit me
Collide with police, there's drugs and homicide in the streets
Live from inside of the beast the scribe writer reporting
Yo there's drama in the streets adolescents having abortions
Proceed with caution down these boulevards and avenues
Niggaz share the same attribute of ice grillin attitudes
D's watchin all the drugs sales and robberies
Reason being the ghetto's America's highest commodity
Blood splattered on the playground cause niggaz spray rounds
Thug niggaz with the 4-pound'll back that ass down
Murder for money and status, our bitches the baddest
Got fiends feeding their habits, D's looking at us through cameras
New York New York
Soldiers stay ready for war
WE THE TRENDSETTERS fuck what y'all was doing before!
Alpha and omega of rap right here
Newcomers guard your grill and watch your back
'Cause we never fight fair in

[Hook]
In Queens, Brooklyn, Bronx, Staten, Manhattan
Truck Jewels and big gats sparkin
New York New York, land of the crime inner cities
Longshots always on the grind, If You with me
Load 'em up (load 'em up)
Spit 'em out (Spit 'em out)
Round 'em up (Round 'em up)
Buck 'em down (Buck 'em down)
Throw 'em up (Throw 'em up)
Shut 'em down (Shut 'em down)
Break 'em up, Break 'em down, Roll 'em up, Roll 'em out

[Rock Shabazz]
During nightime, killers clap guns and blast slugs
Collapsed lung and mad blood if you catch one
In the mix of action, niggaz act dumb on spiced rhum
And light blunts, hearing fight drums
They must want drama, driving past the block
To blast the glock, years later you still feel the aftershock
We dash past the cops, blast open the Masterlock
Open the safe, grab a box and bag the crops
Pop the jeep trunk, gauge heat bumps
Get your meat lumped, stone tied to your feet dumped
In the Hudson, Colt 19 guns is bustin
You either assaulter or victim, what's your function?
Beef in the streets, they creep at least five deep
Streets? Had it up to here like Queen Latif(ah)
Street athletes, handle hammers and throw javelins to abdomens
Hundred yard dashes to sounds of sirens
Long streaks of violence, short periods of peace
Everybody grab they heat we got beef in the streets!
Longshot-niggaz defecate over beats
All this Black on Black bullshit nigga it gotta cease

[Hook]

[Crayon]
Crime in the city
Find in the city
Mad dimes in the city
Do time for the city
Rhyme for the city
Crime Inner-cities
Longshots always on the grind, is you with me?

Live from New York, It's saturday night
World famous skyline, big city with bright lights
In Ghetto Gotham, the beast is clockin'
The streets is watchin', the people talkin'
The fiends is hawkin', the rapists stalkin'
The streets is darkened, the pits is barkin'
The glocks is sparkin', plus killers will air the block out
With the blacka blacka
Dig your back out
With the glock a, copper will take some Blacks out
Plus Crayon and Rock are, guaranteed to change Hip-Hop
Like Chuck and Flav with the clock
Shit be dope like coke in Ziplocs
Strong Island, Yonkers, Albany and company
New Rochelle, Mount Vern(on), Troy, Schenectady
Time travel back to '94 if you with me
New York state of mind hit ya, you've just entered

[Hook]
