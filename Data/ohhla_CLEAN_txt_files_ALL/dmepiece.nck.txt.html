Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
It's driving me outta my mind
That's why it's so hard for me to find
[Repeat]

[Verse 1]
Dime piece definition of a chick
Nice, sweet educated independent fly thang
Way she filling up dem jeans gotta tear drop like Visine
Like WHOOP shawty stuck it out had the touch it
OOPS I could make it juz jump in my COUPE
Wit a diamonds and jewels
I see Jimmy Choo in yo designer shoes
Momma listen you ain't neva heard a flow like diz one
Who you kno Gigalo and still Christian
Lil shawty stop tripping if Don Juan a bishop
Why Nick cant be pimping
Chick, please, I'm juz trynna get in your Vickies
Wait take a minute take a flick juz FREEZE
Cuz you kno the Cannon be flashing I'm getting more head den a aspirin
I'm asking are you a dime the dime

[Chorus]
It's driving me outta my mind (Hey Ladies)
That's why it's so hard for me to find (Hey Ladies)
[Repeat]

[Verse 2 (Izzy)]
Nick you looking for a Dyme
Izz gotta a 9 the dick put em high
Call a Nina Sky Money ova dare
And I ain't got time but to get brain from a dime
Now daz changing yo mind
My dick feelz for you like Shocacon
Flip head and tails wen I tossing yo mind

Single the I den double the Z den say it wit a Y
Where all my ladies dat single the nite
At the strip club got me throwing singles the nite
Da boy poising the beat be the IV on the mic

[Chorus]
It's driving me outta my mind (Hey Ladies)
That's why it's so hard for me to find (Hey Ladies)
[Repeat]

[Hook]
All the ugly chicks be quite (Hey, Hey)
If you fly get a drink ill buy it (Hey, Hey)
At the end of the nite I might hit (Hey, Hey)
Cuz I like it, I love it, can I ball on the beat make a club hit

[Verse 3]
It's like taste, wut lick who

Got a lot of chicks dat love my sick moves
Do wut a pimp do move how a pimp do move
Get a tattoo ma use my initials
Now we got issues and rumors the clear up
Sex real loud next room dey can here us
I'm looking for a dime dat can take the whole 9
Check the sex tapes if you think I'm lying
Are you a dime the dime

[Chorus]
It's driving me outta my mind (Hey Ladies)
That's why it's so hard for me to find (Hey Ladies)
[Repeat]
