[Verse 1]
Homie told me life is precious best lemons in the moment
I ponder for a second, decided he was zoning
Now that's good life living, the present is a gift
I thought about it deeper hit the reefer and a spliff
And my thoughts got wider, longer, stronger
Thought about my world through my window California
People live and die everyday, it's the way
Let the good Lord made us so there's nothing else to say, it's OK
Do your thing for the queens and the kings
It's the meantime, in-between time that'll bring
Consternation, it's like a kick in the caboose
We forget about the blessings, consequences and the truth
Yesterday is gone, tomorrow hasn't come
The only style is the now that'll get you what you want I said
Yesterday is gone, tomorrow hasn't come
The only style is the now that'll get you what you want 

[Hook]
This is autobiographic, real non-fiction
Hands on my sack for this limited edition
Let my nuts hang and of course the beat bang
Zion I the click, ain't a damn thing change
And I got a new style
We get it right now, we get it right now, we get it right now
I said, I got a new style
We get it right now, we get it right now, we get it right now

[Verse 2]
The only thing I've ever know are the seconds in the day
Nothing ever stays the same, everything will fade away
Galaxy, cosmos, universal cause
Stop, feel the pause, heed the universal laws
Love is like the glue, keeps us stuck me and you
We journey through the stew just trying to find the clue
Life is like a road, it's full of many signs
But the grass is always greener when it's on the other side
I hide in the bushes of the time that's allotted me
Gamble with fate, I might win the lottery
That's my intention, I leap through dimensions
If time is a question demand an extension
Of knowledge and wisdom, criminals we've been them
Hustlers we've been them but now it's time we win some
Think that we must be out to lunch
But I'm flyer than a mother and I'm high from the funk

[Hook]

[Breakdown, x2]
Just live for today
Anything you ever wanted to, you know it's right up under you
They'll never keep you running to, the time is right because of you 
Just live for today</pre>
