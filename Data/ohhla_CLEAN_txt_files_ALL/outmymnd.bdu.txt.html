[Erykah Badu]
I'm a recovering undercover over-lover..
Recovering from a love I can't get over..
'covering undercover over-lover..
And now my common law lover thinks he wants another..
And I lie for you, I cry for you
and pop for you, and break for you 
and hate for you, and I'll hate you too, if you want me to
Ah ooh wa ohh, I pray for you
Crochet for you, make it from scratch for you
Make it from scratch for you, leave off the latch for you
Go to the store for you, do it some more for you
Do what you want me to, guess I'm a fool for yooooooo-ooooooooou...
I'm a recovering undercover over-lover...
Recovering from a love I can't get over...
'covering undercover over-lover...
And now my common law lover thinks he wants another..
And I, lie for you, and cry for you
Pop for you, break for you 
and hate for you, and I'll hate you too, if you want me to
I gotta do, my love for you
Chop and {SCREW FOR YOU}, paint it red for you
It's true, it's true, poor Badu..oh ooooooh
Thought I was thru with you, guess I'm a fool for yoooooooooooooooou....

Could this be...love from high...
New frontier...Who's this guy?...
You're so wise...I'm so gone...
by summertime...You had it all...
Built a wall...10 feet tall...
Eheh, now I laugh...hehe, at it all...
Out my mind...just in time...
Never knew...I was blind
What to do...I can't see, yeaaah....
Mama said...Let that be...
Easily...said than done...
I can't feel...I am numb...
Bitter tree...fruit so raw...
Winter cold...let me THAW
I know you, you...Do you hear me?
Out my mind, just in time...

Oooh-ooh, I-iiiiiiiiiiiii
Oooh-ooh, I-iiiiiiiiiiiii
Oooh-ooh, I-iiiiiiiiiiiii
Oooh-ooh, I-iiiiiiiiiiiii
Maaaaaaaan, fuck this shit (fuck this shit)
I'm so addicted, I can't quit, oh-oh
I'm tired of this...yeah 
It's time for me to make some steps 
Easy to blame somebody else 
Hey, but not this time, but not this time
But not this time, but not this - no  
But not this time, but not this time
But not this time, but not this - no
But not this, tiiiiiime 
But not this time, but not this - no  
But not this, tiiiiiime 
But not this time, but not this - no  
20 feet up out of ashes I can rise 
Just like birds and children, I can fly 
And I'll take... my... phoenix flight  
and you can't take... mine...  
but you can try 
Oh, no, not this time, but not this time
But not this time, but not this - no  
But not this time, but not this time
But not this time, but not this - no
But not this, tiiiiiime 
But not this time, but not this - no  
But not this time, but not this time
But not this time, but not this - hey
On and on I seem to go  
Round and round, I seem to go 
Always had the antidote  
Looking for the holy ghost  
Found it in the missing note  
Sinking in a holey boat 
Round and round, I seem to go
Round...and round... and ROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOUND
Oooh-ooh, I-iiiiiiiiiiiii
Oooh-ooh, I-iiiiiiiiiiiii
Yeah, guess it's time to grab my coat  
Evolution's time to grow
Ego tryin to block to do'
Might not have nowhere to go
Now I got a leaing role
