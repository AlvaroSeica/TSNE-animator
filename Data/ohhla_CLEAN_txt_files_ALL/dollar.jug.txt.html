[Chorus: Sample from "I Need A Dollar" by Aloe Blacc] (*Juganot)
I need a dollar, dollar, dollar that's what I need (HEY! HEY!) (*Strictly live)
Well I need a dollar, dollar, dollar that's what I need (*Uh! Heavy Hitters!) (HEY! HEY!)
Said I need a dollar, dollar, dollar that's what I need (*Yeah! Juganot!)
And If I share with you my story, would you share yo' dollar with me?!
(*Yeah! It's goin down)

[Verse One: Juganot] (*Sample from "I Need A Dollar" by Aloe Blacc)
Yo! Give me the mula don't make a nigga have to pull the tool out
COOL OUT!!! With a whistle this will bring the goons out
MOVE OUT!!! Military fashion, click clack
Pound now we'll be talkin 'bout you in past tense
Who's 'bout that money more than the one harrassin
For cold cash I bury an upper classmen
Get all my man's and them a Summer of Sam shit
Inglorious Bastards takin all of your assets (*HEY! HEY!)
I'm 'bout that money like (Like) ain't nothin funny right? (Right)
You hear that rumble in my tummy bet I'm gonna bite
Money's tight so I gotta get it whether wrong or right 
So I might, end up sleepin in bookings another night (Aww man)
That ain't polite to not share I need money like air
To breathe in there's some greenery right there
It seems to me you got it from the way that the lights glares
Off of the necklace, who was sayin that life's fair?
Gimme the dollars....

[Chorus: Sample from "I Need A Dollar" by Aloe Blacc] (*Juganot)
I need a dollar, dollar, dollar that's what I need (HEY! HEY!) 
Well I need a dollar, dollar, dollar that's what I need (HEY! HEY!)
Said I need a dollar, dollar, dollar that's what I need 
And If I share with you my story, would you share yo' dollar with me?!
(*Yeah! Listen up! Uh!)

[Verse Two: Juganot] (*Sample from "I Need A Dollar" by Aloe Blacc)
Once upon a time not long ago
I contracted a disease called funds are low
And I caught it from hangin out with a bunch of broke 
Ass unmotivated niggas that love to smoke (*HEY! HEY!)
Now we, chllin in villas and bungelows
Or a beach house chillin out with a bunch of hoes
Eatin Phillippe, Chow for dinner and brunch Mamosa
So you see, how I'm livin It's like a Huxtable (*HEY! HEY!)
Flow is combustable spit flames in the booth (Booth)
The youth knows Juganot's name is the turh (Truth)
The proofs in the puddin (Puddin) Look at the shit we doin
To music and shootin movies we independently movin (UH!)
Strictly Live crew is niggas who influenced 
An entirely new generation of school truants
They move to it, see the logo and they salute to it
And if your feelin the music, contribute to it
I need dollars.....

[Chorus: Sample from "I Need A Dollar" by Aloe Blacc]
I need a dollar, dollar, dollar that's what I need (HEY! HEY!) 
Well I need a dollar, dollar, dollar that's what I need (HEY! HEY!)
Said I need a dollar, dollar, dollar that's what I need 
And If I share with you my story, would you share yo' dollar with me?!

[Bridge: Sample from "I Need A Dollar" by Aloe Blacc] (Juganot)
Well I don't know If I'm walkin on solid ground (Uh! I don't know man)
'Cause everything around me is, crumblin down (It's goin down)
And all I want is, someone (Yeah!) to help meeeeeeee!!!!! (Help me out, uh, yeah)

[Bridge: Juganot]
I gotta gets the cash, I gotta gets the dough (Huh!)
I gotta gets the cash, I gotta gets the dough (Uh Huh!)
I gotta gets the cash, I gotta gets the dough UH!  (Right!)
I gotta get it, got, got to get it come on!!! (Yeah!)

[Chorus: Sample from "I Need A Dollar" by Aloe Blacc]
I need a dollar, dollar, dollar that's what I need (HEY! HEY!) 
Well I need a dollar, dollar, dollar that's what I need (HEY! HEY!)
Said I need a dollar, dollar, dollar that's what I need 
And If I share with you my story, would you share yo' dollar with me?!</pre>
