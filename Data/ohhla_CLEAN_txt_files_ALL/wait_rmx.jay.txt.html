[Lil' Kim]
Oh uh oh uh yea
I dont think yall ready for this one
The Queen Bee knockout collabo'
And if ya don't know, now ya know

[Ray J]
I been workin all day (And now it's on)
Pull up and don't pay (When the line is long)
Girls in the club (You wanna f...)
Ice grillin these thugs (Ya'll wanna thump)
Is it cause I'ma shine (Major ice)
I'm talkin about blind ya (Like Vegas lights)
Never on the scene (Without my team)
Cali sticky green (Know what I mean)

It's on and poppin
The DJ's rockin
Chickens is watchin
It's on tonight
You had a long day yo
Buy the champ by the caseload
Pockets full of pesos
It's on tonight

[Chorus]
Oh Wait a minute (oh wait a minute)
Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute hey hey hey)
Girl wait a minute
Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute)
Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute hey hey hey)
Yo you know the words say it (wait a minute)

[Ray J]
I been workin all day (And now it's on)
Pull up and don't pay (When the line is long)
Girls in the club (You wanna f...)
Ice grillin these thugs (Ya'll wanna thump)
Is it cause I'ma shine (Major ice)
I'm talkin about blind ya (Like Vegas lights)
Never on the scene (Without my team)
Cali sticky green (Know what I mean)

So much you go through
Only problems know you
Let's party like we supposed to
It's on tonight
There's not a righter way
You've had a tired day
Let's party the night away
It's on tonight

[Chorus]
Wait a minute (oh wait a minute)
Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute hey hey hey)
Girl wait a minute
Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute)
Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute hey hey hey)
Yo you know the words say it (wait a minute)

[Lil' Kim]
Blaow! Tadow! Watch out now, uh-huh
It's the Lil' one and I'm not Bow Wow
Got trees roll it up, you a G throw it up
Nigga slipped me his number on the low - I tore it up
Oh wait a minute they playin my shit, slow it up
What you outta Cris? Fuck it Mo' it up
Y'all just rookies, poppin on the scene
Be careful how y'all talk cause we pop them things
Y'all should see us on the TV, rappin and actin
Yup uh-huh look a little closer
Yea that's us in the Millennium Testarosa
People takin pictures, blowin our cover
Papparazi gonna get you one way or another
Hey wait a minute ain't that Brandy's brother?
Straight from the Eastside, and that's how I ride
Here's another one; Ray J, tell 'em where you from

[Ray J]
I'm from the land of women
Sunny days chrome spinnin
Juice and ginin
It's on tonight
If you feel you're another one
Representin where you from
Sex you're gettin some
It's on tonight

[Chorus]
Wait a minute (oh wait a minute)
Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute hey hey hey)
Girl wait a minute
Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute)
Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute hey hey hey)
Yo you know the words say it (wait a minute)
