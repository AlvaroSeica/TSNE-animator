(Pep Love)
Yo, action speaks louder than words (We give it to ya)
And even, ??act speaks called act strong?? (We give it to ya)
What we do is Act. Phenomenal
Act. Phenom, know what I'm sayin?

Lullabies get sung to you numb dumb nullified hum-drum
Rappers who seem color blind to the spectrum
Of styles I select from any one I choose to get you a bit of direction
Get a clue or get ridiculed when I spit a few
Hollow point verbs that'll riddle you pitiful punks
With chunks ripped from your body
And the party's still jumpin while I'm sayin somethin'
One thing you better know is Hieroglyphics run things
Even when we unheard, even when we unseen
Be aware, we are there, prepare
To counter-act the wack, fake niggas we scared
After dark and fall apart when the disaster start
I blast this part cause I mastered the art
And uh, this is a ritual in which you will enjoy
Now, every man and woman, girl and boy
Grab a hand and try to understand my commandments
I rock the mic harder than pillars of granite and it
Don't stop increasin, until your heart beat start to cease and
Let's start the season, the reasons
That we're here become clear
When I step to the podium toting my full metal gear
Pep's an exception to any rule
And you'll get treated like a stepson, step up and get some!

Chorus
Phenomenal, Action abominable passion (we give it to ya)
You don't want a fraction of friction (we give it to ya)
Fact not fiction, can't stand the heat (we give it to ya)
Then get out the kitchen (we give it to ya
If not then step up and get some! (we give it to ya)

Yo
Melodies I swing hit harder than felonies
Committed to get a nigga's melon seeds
All over the pavement, follow the brave man
Came to free you from your mental enslavement
Incidentally the penalty is when I commence
To killin mc's for frontin like they not feelin the heat
We dealin em, tryin ta make a million
Multiply, movin into the next millenium
Domino tracks Phenomenal Activity
And I'm on a whole nother plane that's giving me the lane
To express my views, caress my jewels and
Stretch my limbs right before I clutch my tool and
Amplify what you can't defy, and stilla get the scrilla
Whether it's damp or dry
I like it like that and if you do to
Then, brace yourself cause what we gon' do is

Chorus (2x)

Swift, lyricism while I'm tokin on a spliff
And this, skism I give em with the rhythm I drift
Everything is everything and I am
Significant gifted, with the mic in my hand
Come on and get with it, love it terrific
Pep is dynamite with, every rhyme I write
Run with the leapords and swim with the sharks
Don't stand so close you'll get singed by the sparks
From these scalding syllables, brewin in a cauldron
Hotter than slugs busted to fill em with holes
It goes like this, you might miss my anecdotes
When the planet goes topsy-turvy
I seem to rock these spots superbly, ya heard me?
Nobody that I see could possible serve me
I'm into maximum thrust adjustments and awesome blossomin
That's if you want some

Chorus (2x)

We give it to ya...</pre>
