[Verse 1]
Revenge, I'm coming for head, I will
Not be denied, yo, yo

Wrath of heaven, I summon forces
Assassin crept in the Dungeon Fortress			
Hunt and stalk,lounge with sword
Swift, tough and coarse, bludgeon your clique			
Running, jumping, rush in forest
Rough and you're done in, cut is flawless				
Struck it's pure risk, when Lone Ninja strikes
Just remorseless with bold vicious might		
Foes in the fight feel the blow of the bo
Stick and spike, steal your soul on a cold winter night			
Ten thousand rivers collect in the sea
Your strength and power withers, I crepted and beleagued	
Move, kick, punch, stab
Ruthless, crush, smash			

[Chorus]
"Dark atmosphere
March past your lair
Combat with large axe
Darts and the spears"

[Verse 2]
The plague arrives, The traitor spies are sentenced
I'm taking lives with Sacred Knives of Vengeance			
They will die, fatal, I'm a menace
Say goodbye, You vaporized then perished			
Sunk deep in, mysterious past
Unleashing, the furious wrath				
Snatch crown I'm not smiling, Blast 
Rounds attack, prowling, you back down from Black Falcon		
Path now grim, act foul, I mad
Wilding, that's how my brash style is				
Aroused the violent anger, you wepted and wailed
In house of flying daggers there's heads for sale				
The archer you confide in, I'm marching
Through the island, beyond the blue horizon				
Assassin with the hood and mask, I bashing 
With the wooden staff, you challenge but you wouldn't last		

[Chorus]
"Dark atmosphere
March past your lair
Combat with large axe
Darts and the spears"
