Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Childish Gambino]
I'm a diamond in the rough, everybody know the score
Bambino on top, and them haters Claymore
"But the people want more!" And I'ma give it to 'em
I was born a winner all I had to do was show 'em
My hoodie canary yellow but I'm bright on my own
Most haters out there take naps like combs
I never sleep; I'm always on my grind
I never eat - unless a rapper spit a rhyme
Sick girls jockin, haters keep hatin
They pissed off cause I'm more +Eli+ than +Peyton+
Cause I'm the underdog, which means I'm under dog
I'm not a nigga who mows snow like Santa Claus
I'm just a nigga with watermelons instead of balls
Cause I work from the bottom to the top
I used to be lost like Lot
Haters got a shook-core/Sha-kur like 'Pac, get it?

[Chorus]
Said the proof is in the pudding, the secret's in the sauce
I ain't gotta tell nobody why they call me the boss
Said the proof is in the pudding, the secret's in the sauce
I ain't gotta tell nobody why they call me the boss
I'm a winner (I'm a winner) {*8X*}

[Childish Gambino]
He work hard for the money, but it ain't about cash 
Life's a schoolyard, I ain't gettin picked last
Better think fast - there's a pop quiz
on which nigga get popped before his 25th
Y'all niggaz need to learn to live, life is awesome
Open up your own store, get a house in Boston
I know it's not easy, it takes some drive
Some niggaz get +Desperate+ like the +Housewives+
And they only see fortune, they don't see wealthy
You can lose a fortune, wealthy is healthy
You can't lose wealth, it's everywhere
The world's made of +Brewster's+ there's +Millions+ here
But if you Richard Pryor they havin the cash you get
And hard work and hopin and your faith is set
I know the world is tough I was just like you
I used to eat Lay's, now my chips is blue

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Two step (two step) {*4X*}
Now bounce it out (now bounce it out) {*4X*}
Fade (fade) {*4X*}
Walk it out (walk it out) {*4X*}
Go 'head {*16X*}
Yeah!</pre>
