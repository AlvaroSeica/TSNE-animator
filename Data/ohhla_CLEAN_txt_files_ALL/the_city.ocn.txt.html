[Frank Ocean]
Give me my power {*4X*}
I built this city
Got plenty concrete, plenty steel
Please gimme my trees give 'em back
Please give me mine
Give me tourists, give me traffic
Give me noise, just give it back
Could you bring back all my police, give me order
Turn back on my lights, give me fuel and water
I think I'm beggin, cause now that everything's gone
I'm needin mine, I'm needin mine, with

[Chorus 1]
The streets all dark, It looks like my building's are gone
I made you the mayor of my town honey
And I'm why you are the Senate representative
I gave you the key to my city
Gave you, power over, power over me
Give it to me, give it back to me
The city belongs to me
The city is ours no more

[Frank Ocean]
Tell the government, please give me funding
Can't you see that I'm doin bad?
Give me floodgates, give me levees
Too much water, can you push it back?
How you just gon' leave me out of of order
I ain't got no lights and no fuel to start up
I know I'm beggin, cause now that everything's dried up
I'm needin mine, I'm needin mine, and

[Chorus 2]
With the streets all dark, the buildings look lost
I made you the mayor of my town honey
And I'm why you are the Senate representative
I gave you the key to my city
Gave you, power over, power over me
Give it to me, give it back to me
The city belongs to me
The city is ours no more

[Frank Ocean]
We used to be sky high
Ohhh, we used to be major, yeah
We used to be sky high
We used to be major baby major

[Outro]
Give it to me, give it back to me
The city is mine baby, this whole city is mine, the city is mine honey
Give it to me, give it back to me
The city is mine oh baby, the city is mine, the city is mine
Now give it to me, give it back to me
The city belongs to me, the city is ours no more {*fades*} </pre>
