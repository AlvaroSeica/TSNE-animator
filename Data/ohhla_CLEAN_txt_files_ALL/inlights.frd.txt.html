[Verse 1]
You see the game try to take me in
That's why I'm movin like it's feds watchin them clock
And don't make me don't make me set it
You biggernots is big rocks, and the watch make you nauseous
Body pack bars the yellow tape be cautious
Zippin up these body bag daily
Heard some niggas whispering, make my shooters go crazy
They on that fake shit, how could you hate this?
A young nigga tryin to get rich on some Bill Gates shit
Come through stuntin, life of a king
I go to war, but you live a life in the ring
Nice with the aim, I'm eatin niggas piranha
That's why I spit the verses say fuck these niggas Rihanna
My flow is dope, it feel like 30 bricks
I'm giving out every ounce, might give you 36
Top gun I am not one under
I'm killing rat niggas, turnin one into the summer
Buying diamonds for my set, screaming out VS
With my nigga Fred, got me screaming VX
Murderin the scene, now you looking so upset
I'm just here to hold it down for my town
Now they ask me how it sound nigga

Now, let's do it
TVM, let's go

[Verse 2]
Oh yeah I spit that shit, live every minute of it
The nineties I'm a spitting image of it
They told me need to get you a loan
My connect tall with the tooth pick razor Ramon
Took the heart for that bread, had to break it at home
I was raised by Bill like Raven Simone, get it
Bill Cosby, my skill probably a kill have to take a pill like I'm tryin to steal mollies
Carry lamas to Carolina and rally
Hard and I'm cuffin devise, over the ballies
Met for the side of me, don't lie to me
Shoot you in your face, your eyes balls, pop out like the lottery
She a slide to me
We're playing in the ghost like Patrick and then we're making the pottery
Rappers tryin to make a shot of me
You must not be poppin that's what it gotta be
'Cause why would you risk it?
Knowing that I move a little different, hold up
I said why would you risk it?
Knowing that I move a little different, I fuck it up

TVM, we hustle

[Verse 3]
Yo, when it comes to lyrics I got gangs of them
Lion King ground proud loss em
Diamond deep a hundred sheets up in your potent
That's for your pumpkin, my skillet leave you open
A nigga say gonna say, they gonna wait us like it's open
But of course I am the source, they been filmin lately
I come in force like an abortion, I'm a kill it baby
You lames I hit like Liu Kang
I got a double pack lock in this game with 2 Chainz
Settle, the most felt rebel
For more grab with the flow lava it melts metal
That right you apply your best price I am big pot
Part them alive, in that night
Vibe with me now shorty she rise with me
And for them N, she do the Benz like 5-50
But we hustle this as life business
You act out and I will black out nigga white privilege</pre>
