intro (Puff Daddy)
I thought I told you... that we won't stop
I rock the party, that rocks your body
I'll rock the party, that rocks your body
Let's go...

(chorus)
I rock the party that rocks the body
You rock the party that rocks the body
I rock the party that rocks the body
You rock the party that rocks the body

(verse 1) MC Lyte
So what's your status? I be the baddest
B to hit the scene since the gangsta lean, I'm all ears
So what you got to say, I hope you bubbling it baby
Now bubbling it my way, let it rain
Ain't no sword up in the game, still want you the same
Ain't a thing changed, instead of knocking boots
We be kicking down Gore-Tex, accept it ain't raw sex
Roughnecks, throw your hands in the air
Lemme hear you say, Oh Yeah
Trust you me I blow up shop
About to blow the roof right off of hip hop

(chorus)

(verse 2) MC Lyte
I'm scorching hot burn the roof off the jam
Got alot but I'm craming to understand
How I got it like this
See I'm gifted and blessed
But I'm never lifted off of any kind of stress
I stress that I'm a witness, to this jam
Lyte the MC is who I am
I cold rock a party in the B girl stance
I rock on the floor make the fella's wanna dance
Now I be the uh and it's all good
And if you understood...
Trust you me I blow up shop
It ain't nuttin' but real hip hop

(chorus)

(verse 3) MC Lyte
Some say I'm shady (that's right)
That's me, complicated rap star, meet Lyte the MC
You see I'm on to you baby and your mechanism
How you hit it when you're in it so hot you keep it fizzling
No, ooh ah she ooo, and all of that too
Keep me wetter than the waters of Kalamazoo
Nigga who you come here wit?
Where your posse at? Uh, leave your boys alone
Tell her you won't be back, I got the cheese baby
My chedder's better, I got that milk, for that Amaretto
Trust you me I blow up shop, Had a little nig' calling the cops
Watch me...

(chorus) x2

I rock the party that rocks the body
You rock the party that rocks the body

(Puff Daddy)
Upside down you turning me, turning me
Round and round you turning me, turning me

(chorus)

(Puff Daddy)
Upside down you turning me, turning me
Round and round you turning me, turning me
Upside down you turning me, turning me
Round Round round round round
Turning me turning</pre>
