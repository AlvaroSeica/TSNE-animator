[Chorus: Charlie Wilson]
I know you see me now right now (I know you see me now right now)
I know you see me now right now (right now, right now)
I know you see me now right now (right now)
I know you see me now right now

[Kanye] You see? See? Ha ha, yeah

[Beyoncé + Kanye]
I got my suit and tie, and I don't know if y'all know
Well maybe y'all do, or maybe y'all don't
But I don't really care
It's how we on it all the time
So I'ma get my money, let's go

[Kanye West]
Yeah, uhh
Now I'ma need you to kill the hypocrisy, this is an aristocracy
I'm Socrates but my skin more chocolate-y
What's up with WHO? That's old news
I'm in a speed boat, in my boat shoes
Huh? I swear my whole collection's so cruise
I might walk in Nobu, with no shoes
"He just walked in Nobu like it was Whole Foods
That nigga crazy, I told you!"
Immature adult (uh-huh) insecure asshole (what else?)
If you fall on the concrete, that's yo' asphalt/ass fault
If you pass on a Kan' beat, that's yo' last thought
Get what you ask for, I swear that's yo' ass so
She got a big, booty but she couldn't drop that ass low
'Til you take your last hoe and rope up all the cash flow
When you gettin money they be all up on yo' ass yo
When you gettin money Kan's don't let a nigga pass go
Straight to jail yo, in a hellhole
Right next to Lucifer, tell him I said hello
Ask if I'ma be there soon and tell him I said hell no!
Yo what you say when your people get out of jail, huh?

[Beyoncé] + (Kanye)
My niggaz is home, I guess I got everything, everything I want
(Let's go shoppin dawg, let's celebrate) But I don't
No matter how good it gets (free Weezy though)
It'll never be like before
No women in the crowd, screamin and it's loud
Doin things not allowed, and I swear it's goin down right now
(You know what it is) I know one thing, my momma would be proud
And you see me lookin up, cause I know she's lookin down right now

[Chorus]

[Kanye West]
Pour the champagne, let your watch show
Shorty got her man watch, wrist look colossal
I admit, my first watch was a Fossil
Now I'm in the Louvre, lookin for fossils
Attention to detail is so uncanny
And the whip's on the Sprewells, it's so un-Caaaamry
Somebody need to put us on caaaamera
The world of Roley's and everyone faaaamilies
Stay Jordan fresh, suits and Ferrari's
Cute, your shorty watch Barney's, we head to Bonnie's
End up at Marley, Georgio, service from Sergio
The keen Lamborghini, chain throw off the vertigo
I know the flow just hit a hellafied vertical
This the Christ year, last year was magic, 32
Lyrically can't none of y'all murder 'Ye
Cause y'all raps ain't got no vertebrae
I got styled last June and she heard of me
I killed the fur last Paris, raised the murder rate
First of all, we all know the beats is
like a mix between Fergie and Jesus
Imagine the direction of this immaculate conception
Every one of His Majesty's swim parties is pageantries
Cannonball off the divin board when I am bored
All my homies GD's, but I am Lord
Rap god, Greek mythology
And this life too crazy to think logically
Here's somethin that you could use in analogy
My life is like a child's illusions become reality

[Beyoncé + Kanye]
Now go get my throne, cause I don't wanna stop
I just go in my zone, and I'ma make it hot
'Til it's time to go, when it's time to go
Where you tryin to go? You better act like you can see me now

[Kanye] Exactly! Rosewood! Uh-huh, uh-huh

[Chorus] - repeat to the end w/ ad libs

[Kanye West]
I know you see me, I know you see me
I know you see me, it's like I'm 3D
I know you see me, I know you see me
I know you see me, it's like I'm 3D
I know you see me, I know you see me
I know you see me, it's like I'm 3D
I know you see me, I know you see me
I know you see me, it's like I'm 3D

Uhh, ay-ay, feel like one of them R. Kelly joints, right?
Ay... I bet you they put me back on the cover of Ebony now
Ha... I know Jet Magazine callin right now

I like that, got your new suit on
And she got her extra cute on
Ay, hey, hey, hey!

Hahaha, yeah... uhh, you can do the Bus Stop to this
