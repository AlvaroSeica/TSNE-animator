Aw, naw, hold up ya'll
I got a couple verses sick enough to throw up, pause
and long enough, the world has hidden like a blow up doll
behind a buster while his mission is to blow up ya'll
and slow up, halter top, pump the brakes
little airbag is everybody's wrap around my tape like it's their cast
care to pass them a pardon like judge
if the secretary's chest I could Winona like Judd
nice buts, ifs, ands why I'm lonely like Bud Bundy
want a kickstand 'cause I'm tipping like I'm on something
oh junk he's only arm's reach from splitting wigs
then tore up he chose the wrong way into the biz
'get it big' so they tell him
now, he only prides in crushing rapper cerebellums
wide, receding turns but I done passed the intersection
driving off instinct like a lost fish
Nemo Pacific ways to keep them vibing off clicks, drums
not invisible for those who want to get dumbed off
hustling in the city like a baller but there is no sport
crossing over jurors like there is no court
courting overtures as if there is no more
while the moral of the story is the end on course
of course, though my mind's killed
I still find Will and I grab it by the ears like this...

- And if you find me flying with my hands like a plane, shawty, I ain't high
I'm on break or probably on leave
don't matter, anyway, just never bother with me (don't bother with me)
Yeah, you can find me flying through the air like a plane
shawty, I ain't lying
I'm on break and probably might leave
don't matter, anyway, just never bother with me (don't bother me)...

Aw, draws, no more 'cause
I seen enough of lingerie to make me throw up bras
a lot of women intervene to take their nose up far
enough to only to start to bleeding when they don't touch stars
I know some smart but all I seem to date is little airheads
and everybody's wrapped around my date like it's their bread
care to cash in my problems like funds
but the cash, it won't ever buy a daughter or son
tried grudge, hate and animosity towards love
till I hugged fate in bed and dodged sleep before the sun
yep son, hoping death won't find me before I touch
home base playing deadly hide and seek with normal drugs
in a way that is only safe if I want my face
on the face of a cover made for a funera-l, well
though my mind's swelled I shall be aware
that it's Heaven's light gleaming or it's hell...

- And if you find me flying with my hands like a plane, shawty, I ain't high
I'm on break or probably on leave
don't matter, anyway, just never bother with me (don't bother with me)
Yeah, you can find me flying through the air like a plane
shawty, I ain't lying
I'm on break and probably might leave
don't matter, anyway, just never bother with me (don't bother me)...

Aw, clauses hold up laws
a system designated making sure we don't touch bars
is simply segregated somewhat like a klu klux party
to humiliate by emulating most dumb thoughts
a person you thought was smart but is partially retarded
sparking issues of a common, often hiding in tomorrows
all the other martyrs seem to wallow in a dollar
and wonders why the dollar always complicates the problems
uh, them dumb, should've taught them something
but the teacher was too busy flirting with her youngsters
with pick-up lines inside of nursery rhymes
to put the peety with the tweety giving birth to a sign that Earth has declined
and now we on the brink, brink, brink, brink
evil's allowed to shatter what you think, think, think pink, red overhead
crippled ligaments below; thought it hectic where we left
come see what's living up the road, like whoa!
but can't turn a back 'round
square biz where they're not concerned of backgrounds
act now, while in high demand is class clowns
sought to ease pains, the world's best chance is to laugh now
cry later when the Judgment's passed and lied down
Life Savers come in multiple flavors and packs now
wow, though it's right here, I fear my tears ain't enough to make you hear what I feel...

- And if you find me flying with my hands like a plane, shawty, I ain't high
I'm on break or probably on leave
don't matter, anyway, just never bother with me (don't bother with me)
Yeah, you can find me flying through the air like a plane
shawty, I ain't lying
I'm on break and probably might leave
don't matter, anyway, just never bother with me (don't bother me)...</pre>
