[Chorus]
I Just Pulled Up in That Old Color of Glue
I just spend 20 on a chains, thousands on some shoes
I done fuck every bitch you wanted to
They don't fuck with you cause I don't fuck with you
They like chief sosa when we gone hit the stu
I'm like when you put the o on side the two
They like sosa and I got ya album too
If I was you bitch I will buy two

They like sosa you so mean to me
You don't know what you mean to me
Ever since you came in the game
You been fucking up the scenery

I know I feel like john cena
Ain't no nigga seeing me
Tryna rob me they meet my damn nena
Ain't a nigga getting a thing from me

Had to put that bitch out
She was on some things to me
She ain't wanna shake her ass
She wanted to sing for me

Tryna blow nigga oh no
Cause I ride my thing with me
I feel like g.I joe tho
I come from the meanest streets
Almighty sosa from the o
That what it mean to me
Balling with no basketball
Got a basketball in my beamer seats
Poppin shit like vegetable oil
Poppin shit like season wheat
I take the mon to dangelong [?]
I pop some shit I'm my meeting great

Cause I got all this johnny dang on me
And I got all this damn bread on me
You ain't taking shit
You can take one to the head homie
Now I got all this damn red on me

[Chorus]

Chief sosa shiting on you lames man
She like I know I follow you on instagram
She give me nose like she toucan Sam
Smoking on this dope and I'm coughing like dam
Bitch stop acting dumb u know who I am
I be balling hard and flexing no jams

And if you want a verse send my check in the mail
You niggas ain't gone shoot man you niggas gone tell
Get yo ass smoke if you dropping the l
They like hold up chief so I be bopping the l
Get yo ass smoke if you dropping the l
They like hold up chief so I be bopping the l

[Chorus]</pre>
