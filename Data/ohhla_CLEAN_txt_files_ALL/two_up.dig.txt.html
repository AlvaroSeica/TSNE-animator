Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Two up, for this great life, yeah, it feels right
Go ahead put it up, everybody live it up
If tomorrow never comes
Two up, for this great life, yeah, it feels right
Go ahead put it up, everybody live it up
If tomorrow never comes
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, yeah, now keep em high
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, yeah

I'm feeling good, rather I'm feeling great
The game got me feeling over I don't feel the aches
I'm tryina eat, you tryina steal my plate
All the hate, throw it out the front door, Phillip Banks
I know I can, but you feel I can't
You think my hype is all gas but you fill my tank
How you fuel me with what you cruelty
And I'm a beast on the mic and that's the beauty
I'm illmatic Nas, reasonable Jay, my adidas run, that's reasonable to say
And this season ima flip it when I hit them with my ring
When your boy raises hell, everybody better pray
Hey men, and women too
We don't hang cause misery loves the miserable
But if your life's love is kicking like fight club
Let's have a great day and see what the night does

Two up, for this great life, yeah, it feels right
Go ahead put it up, everybody live it up
If tomorrow never comes
Two up, for this great life, yeah, it feels right
Go ahead put it up, everybody live it up
If tomorrow never comes
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, yeah, now keep em high
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, yeah

I got my smart suit on, I'm ingenious
I laugh but I'm serious, I mean it
I'm married to my craft and I don't intend on cheating
Might be tardy to the party but im early for the meeting
The smell of money lingers, go and take a wiff
You gonna need some robitussin cause I'm a make you sick
The first track hit got one straight into the pros
Now it's first class trips I set later to the roads
I don't get it later just creating for the flows
Sittin on the globe, and I'm using it as my comode
uh uh unload thats gross i know in the league of my own
Ain't nobody close so, clap your hands
For el capitan, and somebody tell Spinking to play this track again
And ain't no looking back unless I'm backing in
I'm a thank you in my speech when I'll win

Two up, for this great life, yeah, it feels right
Go ahead put it up, everybody live it up
If tomorrow never comes
Two up, for this great life, yeah, it feels right
Go ahead put it up, everybody live it up
If tomorrow never comes
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, yeah, now keep em high
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, yeah</pre>
