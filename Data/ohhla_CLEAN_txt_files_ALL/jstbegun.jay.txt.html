[Talib Kweli]
Ay, yo, Hi-Tek?
Do me a favor, man, speed it up a little bit

From the intro you know I'm so influential, 'cause I'm glowin' like a candle
The focus is so essential, dawg, what you tryna get into?
I steady the flow, ready to blow like snotty tissue
They snitchin' like Donnie Brisco and countin' like Monte Cristo
The ghetto full of betrayal like Iago and Othello
Your fellow neighbor will slay you, they'll smoke you like cigarellos
Police, want that info, they'll grill 'em like portabellos
I'm murderin' instrumentals 'cause I rap with the conscience
Of felons, killers, and monsters, so revealing and honest
We're still feelin' the promise, some nights I kill 'em with kindness
Hittin' like Muhammad Ali, you more like Tatyana
All this is prob'ly karma: You dishonored the father
Whether it's God Almighty, or the almighty dollar
We follow the prophets like Islamics or the Dalai Lama
Your bullet points so hollow they could prolly pierce body armor
Look in the scope, my people still a target

[Jay Electronica]
Smile on my face, tears of a sad clown
Feelin' out of place as I whistle a cab down
If I tip extra, can I huff a cig?
Blow my smoke out the window, droppin' ashes on the bridge
I'm in New York now, like Akeem and Semi was
Tryna get the lobby door open from a semi buzz
I just wanna go to the slum
And throw my money on the floor like the Notorious B.U.M. (Uhh)
Build a home, teach a class, start a revolution
Free the mind, heal the body, talkin' evolution
This that black Elohim Anunnaki rap
That Farrakhan Hakeem Olajuwon Khadafi rap
I dedicate this to my niggas in New Orleans
Rockin' black and gold stocking caps and fleur-de-lis Shockey hats
I'm in the coatroom, screamin' "Who Dat" on the double
Servin' gumbo with' a shovel, dawg, I'm on another level
Me and Kweli come together like two pieces of metal
We magnetizin' the ghetto

[J. Cole]
Yeah, now here's the memo
I'm a rebel without a cause, a bezel without no flaws
And shawty, you straight, but you look way better without no drawers
Let's sweat out this alcohol, bet I'm about to ball
And never let up, look how I just crept up without applause
Fed up with all the frauds and left y'all without a job
The center of attention, this is clever, I'm Pau Gasol
Really though, I'm LeBron, really don't got my mind
On this new school of rappers, I will really go Columbine
And throw up the diamond sign, boy you know I'm a shine
Flow is in Ramadan
'Cause couple years ago, the game had they pajamas on
But now they on my dick, man, I should throw a condom on
Ay, 'cause a nigga comin' raw like I ain't got one on
And I ain't stoppin' or coppin' no pleas, I just lock and load, squeeze
Dawg, I'm on a higher level, I'm on top of nosebleeds
Niggas say they sick, but when they write, they don't sneeze
Like the nigga on the block wavin' his Glock but won't squeeze
Please

[Mos Def]
Hold your applause until the ceremony end
Yours truly, truly blessed, yet again a noble pla-anted
Super magic, abracadabra kid
Mysterious master Jim, blacker pen, arrowhead
With the long-barrel stem, and his apparel fresh
Harbor lights shinin' out the black power grid
With the Black Power grip
And pure power don't power trip
Push the cellar ceiling up and make the tower tip
Your Gladwell point, and Babylon polish
All about nothin' where it's all about the dollar
And mansions on the fault line of a shaky market
The devil at the dancehall, thirsty for a partner
Get off em
There is not a parcel or a portion
Or a measure of a fortune more awesome
Gorgeous
The funky Four Horsemen and one more
With Hi-Tek on the score, once more, of course

You're welcome, thanks
Appreciation for your participation
Special dedication
Celebration, bitches</pre>
