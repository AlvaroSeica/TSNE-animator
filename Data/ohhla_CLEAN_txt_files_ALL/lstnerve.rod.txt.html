Typed by: Cno Evil

[Tim the Enchanter from 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' sample]
That's the most foul, cruel and bad-tempered rodent you ever set eyes on

[Intro: Li-Mouse]
Yo, get off me, man, get off me
Yo, yo, I don't even care man
These cats is getting me mad pissed, man
Talking this shit, man, what the fuck?
Yo, my last nerve, you're standing on my last nerve, man

[Chorus: Cno Evil &amp; Li-Mouse]
We, don't, care, if you don't like the sound you hear
Cuz we, won't, change for you
And start sounding wack, won't dare
We, don't give a, flying fuck, what you think
So if you don't like what you hear, oh well
(Oh well, homey, oh well...)

[Cno Evil]
My first page, be filled with the verse rage
In the worst way, I can leave your brain thirsty
Drained out, the drought; will leave your mind leaking
My darts fly out to reach you like missiles that be seeking
C is a king, my hat is a crown, chair is a throne
My beats are a live band, my raps are poems
When my CD drops, you'll be shopping on time
Credit cards online, or cash, standing on line
Curves over the block, like a snake with a glock
Hickory dickory dock, Mouse ran up the clock
With hip-hop, three blind mice, thought they was nice
Til they froze up like water freezes to ice
Darts sharpshoot ya, break ankles like Kurt Angle
My heat leaves a scent in the air like candles
I treat music like a skin flesh, and bruise it
'Worlds is warrin', by the way I Tom Cruise it
I don't really give a shit, man
You can keep yappin' and yappin', but I ain't listening
This is how we started, and this is how we ending
All that hard work over years, we just beginning
Tamias exquisite, life you don't have, you don't live it
So don't talk about it in your records with your visions
Listen for a few minutes of your time
Your day would be worth more, anyhow, with my rhymes
Rest in peace to the Ol' Dirty Bastard
Taught me about the lyrical disasters
'Crash your crew', was trained just how to
Master fools with rhymes and voodoo
Who you to tell me what to do?
My face is on the album cover, I don't see you
I don't see your name, I don't see your support
I just see your mouth talking more than you be worth

[Li-Mouse]
I spawn lyrics that storm, through your speakers
Keeping listeners interested with little features
Weak flows on the radio have hit my last nerve
Somebody worth hearing had to grab the mic and observe
Yes, not afraid to mention the name, once more
Rodentz terrorize opponents, then ignore
Those who still continue to hate on our manners
You're mad late like students who ignore using planners
Caution to those, who initiate for me to spray
Sorta like Miyazaki, I blow 'spirits away'
A 'castle in the sky' has a miracle of offense
If you reach us, we crush you with immense
Amounts of attacks and many different forms and designs
Intimidated by our crushing, force you to resign
Anticipated to vibrate your car system
Trust me, you'll never have to say, 'man, I miss him'
Because the sound you hear, is for all eternity
Babies will be born with this through maternity
Leave us, only if you don't believe us
Heavily encrypted, impossible to read us
See me, lounging in the lobby
Cocky, shook up Bicronians, like the Zentrati
Mediocre flows are becoming real choppy
Like the hand with the face, it's real sloppy
You got me? Haha, it may not be
What you wanna hear from the Mouse
Ability to switch myself up, up, up and about
Who the fuck said you can chill in my house?
Goofy muthafucka better 'Donald Duck' my punches
You get ripped up like doing mad crunches
I'm the Autobot and you're the Decepticon
Leaving you no choice, when I come on (muthafucka)

Autobots, transform and roll out!</pre>
