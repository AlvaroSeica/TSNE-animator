[Intro: dialogue from "Money Talks"]
"It's like a G dog, on a fly tip, flossin with the pussy
"Cuttin in the crib - WHAT THE FUCK DOES THAT MEAN?!"

[Chris Tucker]
"Man I don't wanna have to beat yo' ass"
"But I will BEAT, YO', ASS!"

[Diabolic]
Yeah, uh-huh
I double XL and won't read The Source
I'd rather leave 'Zino in pieces like a Jesus cross
Plain and simple dawg, you're weak and soft
Like Lance 'Un' Rivera filin police reports
Since Quest told me Rhymefest where "Jesus Walks"
Kanye believed I could make demons talk
Your opinion about me, better keep it short
If I wanted to know what you think, I'd read your thoughts
I'll place you next to Angela's debut
A biter who sound more like Jay than Jay do
I hate this rap shit, but manage to stay true
In a game where cash rules and biting's okay too
Remy Martin's a joke, yeah I just said it
Quotin Jigga so much, he should get writer's credit
At the same time, Jay shines, and takes lines
If Frank White's the only one you bite, I say fine
He's biggin up his brother, but now he quotes like
Big's dead anyways, might as well ghostwrite
And that's the reason I got cats believin
Ma$e should quit rap and go back to preachin
After leavin he'd been gone for years
But sounds the same like every Ja Rule song I hear
Eminem hailed Mary since 'Pac wrote it
Acting hard, pullin a gun that's not loaded
So don't bother to ask where the mic is at
Cause Ras Kass will get his license back before you nice in rap
Lil' Flip's just marketing and strategy babble
Only freestyle champ who never actually battled
I know how your manager put you in the mixture
Had you hold a fake trophy,and took a few pictures
Then Jean got a deal, with no kids to feed
Ruff Ryders signed a bigger bitch than Eve
"Learn Chinese," I'd rather listen to Shells
While his album ain't drop and he sits on the shelf
Living in hell, seekin fame and stardom
Nah, you from 91st Street, claimingHarlem
Jae Millz stay real, but fake in the street
Scram must be pissed that he wasted his beat
If your jewelry was real I'd be snatchin it off
Too bad you bought it out the back of The Source
But luckily I'm +Making a Band+ cheapskate
Like shut the fuck up and get Puffy's cheesecake
Dylon go makin some bold statements
'til I punch his whole face in, and probation
Ness talking tough, he playing his own role
When Birdchest Frederick had him in a chokehold
Fabolous'll choke slow from the stampede
So when he "Holla Back," young'n can't breathe
Puff's plan B, Lost Ma$e, got Loon
The next artist Bad Boy's gonna drop soon
How you like it? I stick ya baby ma's woom
Pop shrooms in disguise like costumes
I do respect Dead Prez, top to bottom
But killin some white people won't solve the problem
Watching Peedi Crakk, y'all don't need me to say
he sound like Louisville from O.G.C.
Andre 3000 yo' shit's confusin
Only thing Caroline's good for is Distribution
Quick conclusion, hear what I'm sayin
I hope you crash in a ditch yo, I'm not playin
Erykah Badu's the Yoko Ono of this rap shit
Makes a good musician turn into a faggot
Canibus was left battlin for food stamps
Rap ain't work, so he's hidin out in boot camp
New plan, lose fans, smoke a few grams
Dis Slim and start a group with that dude Stan
Young Buck and Lloyd Banks would have no sales
If they ain't suck dick and ride 50's coattails
Mos Def don't rep like rappin for years
Two words, quit rap, stick to your actin career
I'm laughin at queers like J-Kwon so I strictly
run his pockets while he in the club gettin "Tipsy"
Slap Nelly quickly, 'til his nose break
He'll need a Band-Aid big enough to cover his whole face
I don't hate, this is what the industry wants
Diabolic's attempt at a publicity stunt
But this is my opinion, so I'm speakin the truth
Namin names when you see me in the booth
And if I ain't mention you chumps in what I drop
Either I like your music, or you suck and I forgot~!

Question, are we playing the same game?
Y'all beat around the bush, 'Bolic name names
I just did my own thing and tried to maintain
'til I realized everything you say's lame
Who am I? Diabolic, Foul Play bitch
Who am I? The only one who ain't scared to say shit
Who am I? The only one who could get away with
makin fun of these clowns and the garbage they spit</pre>
