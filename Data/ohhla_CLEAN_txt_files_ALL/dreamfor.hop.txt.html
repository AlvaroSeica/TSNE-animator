[Verse 1]
Your the only girl that never disrespected me
You always know how to bring out the best of me
Cupid shot us separately
Then we came together, it was destiny
I love until there ain't no loving left in me
Definitely
Our souls will ride together, even when the stars die
And when parted, my heart cries
It's angels like you, who make it hard why?
It's cause you beautiful
Outgoing and smart
And shit you really set the bar high
All you bring to me is happy moments
You make me feel like I'm cute
Even though my face got all this acne on it
The way I feel for you, you can't revoke it
Cause it changed me, and my family knows it
Damn, we both just kind of just fell into this
You gave me proof that heaven exist
But tell me, what is love without a headache or twist?
You come taunting, every night after twelve
When I'm unconscious
You never come out when the suns watching
Baby, I need you

[Chorus]
Where are you?
Are you only in my dreams?
Only when the moon is shining
That's when you are beside me
Girl, I need you
And that's real
I don't wanna wake up
I'll stay asleep (You know baby)
Your love is all I need
I'm really hoping I find you

[Verse 2]
I wake up in the morning
With this sensational pain
It goes straight to the brain
Then my day is invaded with rain
Engraved in my veins is your name
This ain't gonna change
It is staying remain
Unless my heart is deflated and drained
Your love is magic
Daydreaming about you is such a habit
Thought I saw you when I was driving
But I was stuck in traffic
If other girls flirt they're sadly mistaken
I tell em' scram
Cause they need to know I'm happily taken
You see my love life
It wasn't going well till I found you
Fellas get jealous and doubtful
When I tell em' about you
I know we had our fair share
In the past, with selfish lust
But once we came together
We sealed it and nailed it shut
Your touch is that of a goddess
When we kiss, I'm at a lack of words
Especially when we pull away
And then you smile afterwards
In our hearts, we're no different in color
We live for each other
I'm glad you're my significant other
I love you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Baby it saddens me to know you only exist in dreams
I sit an theme for you when I'm awake
And it seems like I'll never be happy unless I sleep
I failed to see the point in living without you
It got me thinking death is sweet
I'll never know unless I leap
I guess I reach for the stars cause girl I'm in love with you oh so desperately
But I'm about to do is discreet
I rest the cheek on the pillow as I'm counting sheep
Take me to ecstasy
I tried to get you out my head, the pains a lot worse
I love you more than anything! I won't even put God first!
You're the reason I sleep so often
I'm hurting the night I don't see you
I just keep on tossing and turning
I feel so lost and deserted
You made my life good
I told you if I had to take a bullet for you
I would
So baby here I go with the proof
This is it
The moment of truth
Only for you. [Gunshot]

[Chorus x2]</pre>
