(chorus)
Don't fool yourself by thinking you're shrewd
perpetrating with false disguise
First veer humble then you'll become truly wise
Don't fool yourself

V1: I'm oozing profusely out of the melancholic frames
and giving rise to feedback as they're echoing their joyous strains
With knife I cut malevolence as the anon scenes grew tense
like the simile nail-head appearance of the excrescence

so I give birth to advice to pronounce that your love mst be real
Christ sits at right hand to facilitate creations with philosophic and amorous associations
I want to know all the total souls by algorithm compriser
deem the repetitive calculations used to find the greatest common divisor.

In the world I'd like to abate the Bling-Bling mental state
with stints of branched-chain fatty amine of high molecular weight
And the protection of right living on the exterior of my chest plate
I defeat the demonics with signs of "Come Test It"
As I manifest the gospel to transform the agrestic</pre>
