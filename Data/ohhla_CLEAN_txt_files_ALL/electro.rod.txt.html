[Intro: kung fu sample (Cno Evil)]
You don't think, that he's a bit strange?
Huh? What do you mean?
He's a scholar, but he has no art
And he's so keen to make friends with us
He flatters us, says the right things (uh-huh)
He's just too good to be true?
What? (this how we do it, kid, check it, yo)

[Cno Evil]
Is you ready? Hold your mic steady, Fab Five Freddy
I 'think differently', you can call me Dreddy
I chopped this beat up, it's like Edward Scissorhands
I'm here to take a stand, it's The Rappers On Demand
Enterprising New Technical Zones
My pen is chrome, I turn lyrics into poems
Me and Mouse been doing this since yellow school buses
Hip hop ain't dead but it sure is on it's crutches
I'm moving up like Conan O'Brien
Whoever said your songs is hot, is lying
Why you even try? No tools, you can't build
KFC fried rhymes, change it up and get grilled
Guarantee hit, son, so just listen
You can't get nowhere in rap by just dissing
Or freestyling, you wilding, sit down and write
Make yourself a banger, and just call it a night, alright?

[Chorus: Inspectah Deck sample]
If you wan't some, get some, this is it, son
This one, make 'em feel the fraction
Guaranteed hit, son, missed none
Flip one, you better bring your big gun

[Li-Mouse]
Make 'em feel the friction, good finger licking
You best watch where you point, and who you sticking
You stay tripping, hoping my attacks start missing
I'm flipping, like when your chick starts bitching
The clock keeps on ticking, now your tripping
Li-Mouse can't be held, once he starts spitting
Now listen, to the wise words that be written
Adolescent minds feels like I'm baby sitting
Timberland boot fitting, kicking your ass
Got 'em where we want 'em, now, we smash
You to a bloody mess, none, no less
I possess skills capable of blowing holes in the chest
Evident we could fine to be the best
Blah blah, I don't really give a damn about the rest
I suggest, you don't contest measly pest
Be impressed by what's addressed and digest, muthafucka

[Chorus]</pre>
