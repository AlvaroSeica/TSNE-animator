Verse 1: Beelow

Whoa now its Beelow ballin' hard and bezzeled out
Big bodies all the time even shine with the lights out
Flipping bees daily, You baller blockin' but can't fade me
Gotta make 'em holla wooday every time the DJ played me
Ain't no thanking me, that's how we bring it down south
In the pent and black on with the grills in mouth
Ghetto millionaire, done bought my hoes a play tag
Done hooked up with the 69 boyz be got damn
Just bought a new suburban cause I like the way it look
When I play with them assassyn's you gone say its off the hook
Wooday that's how I talk
"Unt ugh", that's what we say
Big bodies how we ride and platinum is what we play
Three thousand out the shoot, mean mugging is hollin what
Ya boy on fire, I'm not P but I lights it up
So when ya'll be hollin' shawty, its cool

You see a tight girl then holla WOODAY
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wooday

Verse 2:

Jumping out the game whoa
What about a hundred or better
Flossin' in them bodies make yo girl get wetter
You ain't no better when I'm doing when I do what I do
Scream whoa to them hoes then I'm knocking them boots
I ain't tripping unt ugh that's how we do it down south
Three chunks in our pocket with them golds in our mouth
Hoes get on them blocks, got 'em hotter than Wayne
That's how I'm coming up in this game so I'm doing my thang

Chorus: repeat 2x

Them boyz down south be hollin' WOODAY!
Rollin' big bodies and screaming WOODAY!

Verse 3: Thrill Da Playa

We be down like 4 flat vogues on gold d's
Thrill and Beelow, but we needs mo cheese
Pull some hoes like grass get mowed down
Cause like ballin g's we be laying them hoes down
See we don't be playing round my nigga we all out
Get 'cha head in the Mercedes we ball out
In the 90's it was bout G-Money and Beelow
But now its bout 69 and Beelow
And we tight like Betty and Fred enough said
A million, ha, nigga that ain't enough bread
You ain't heard we bread, down south we cost mo
Independent so you KNOW! We floss mo
From Florida to the ATL out to the Bu
Me and all my woodays is stoned out for the new
And everytime you see us we beam we on shine
Home Bass is ballin forever we gone grind

Chorus repeats 4x

Them boyz down south be hollin' WOODAY!
Rollin' big bodies and screaming WOODAY!
You see a tight girl then holla WOODAY!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wooday</pre>
