I'm the best and I'm the brightest got the touch just like I'm minus
Natural born Spartan heart like Leinitus
300 by my side so I'm begging for you to try this
Listen I'm a giant just like Glyph
King like tut, your position is futile
Black Carlitos about my money like Siegel
On point like a needle trying to do it like the Beetles
Big, any other way a be evil
Don of a mafia that's hungry like Austria
Immunity plates na ain't no fucking stopping us
Crystal dreams states blue phobia
Chilling with the feans  baby this is my utopia
Sitting at the table with plans to get a mill
If I don't get a deal then fuck it I'm gone deal
Lawyer money first I'm beating it no appeal
This is life no movie so I gotta keep it real
Lyrical magician making magic on these instruments
Dope mathematician major it happen with these increments
Started it I'm a finish it so currency is limitless
jail illiterate I don't get they sentences
Yea I'm in the hay stack I won't find the pen
Where should I begin conclusion I'm about my end
Am I shitting on the game well shit it all depend
If I'm good by myself tell me why I need a friend
I'm young and I'm paid so I got these cracker sick
Make it rain with change killuminati  in the mist
They all blood sucker so I know what make them tick
I love it yea I fucking love it spend ideal amount thinking nothing of it
Said I love it I fucking love it spending ideal amounts thinking nothing of it
It's Mr volcano flow I'm not dormant
Hot homeboy like papa bears pourage
Vocab dumb I can spit the whole thesaurus
Eating shit alive carnivore Taranasoris
Grandma name Jessie and it's one name Deloris
Still they baby boy but in the streets I'm enormous
Stacking up these bills and I ain't talking about a Moorage
I put money up like it's sitting in a storage
Wrist turn fish burn just like Lawrence
I drop to the block one a month like Jordan's
Can't get enough it's growing up my money is maturing
You trying to shop I'd rather not bullshit I'm ignoring
That language is foreign Blah blah blah it's foreign
I'm trying to stay a freeman just like Morgan</pre>
