Song:   Victimized
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Mike Shinoda]
No regret for the confidence betrayed
No more hiding in shadow
Cause I won't wait for the debt to be repaid
Time has come for you

[Chorus 2X: Chester Bennington]
Victimized, victimized, never again victimized

[Mike Shinoda]
They're actin like they want a riot, it's a riot I'll give them
As the sound climbs higher on this violent rhythm
For you snakes in the grass, supplyin the venom
I ain't scared of your teeth, I admire what's in 'em
Keep 'em waitin in the shadows there, thinkin they hidden
But the truth is you don't have the stomach to get 'em
Go on already, hit 'em! Yeah, you gotta be kiddin
Wanna talk about a victim I'ma put you there with 'em

[Chorus]

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
RRRRRRRRRRRRRAH~!</pre>
