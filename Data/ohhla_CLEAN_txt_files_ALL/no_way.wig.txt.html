[Intro: Shawn Wigs (Eamon)]
Aiyo E? (yeah) I got this broad, every time, son
I take her out, she always want me to pay for something
To buy her something (get the fuck outta here, yo
She knows this shit is ho-op, keep them hoes hungry)
There she got right now, watch watch

[Shawn Wigs]
Ma, there's no way, I'mma let you max my cards
Spend my money all day like you buying me Clarks
I know the jewels look lavish, and the jewels on pressing
The way Wiganomics break girls hearts, so depressing
Don't get mad, I know them other niggas spend money
I get money, I slept around Playboy bunnies
And porn stars, had the bats, buying me cars
Flying me down to Miami just to blow cigars
I'm off the charts, best thing since chocolate chips
Ma, I love how you shake them hips, let me beat that</pre>
