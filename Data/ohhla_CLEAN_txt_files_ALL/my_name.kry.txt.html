Song:   My Name Rings Bells
Typed by: pneumatic

[Chorus: Kryme Life]
My name ring bellz from the streets to the cells
Big clientele, Product move well
Big money stacks, Hand-off like NFL
Narcotics took a big OZ livin off sales
My name ring bellz, My name ring bellz
From Marcy to Stapleton we ring bellz
From Nostrand to Broad street niggas know well
We give it out for 113 and 212

[Kryme Life]
Yo, This year I got somethin to prove
I'm settin the stand, so I guess I gotta run em' the rules
I'm bout to crush nigga's groove, I'm makin examples
I get my rolls with the food, Fuck breakin them samples
Cause they dirty in the field where the work get handled
For my bread get broken down and dismantled
This year I need all of my chips, Keep em' comin
I aint postin on this corner hard for nothin
On blast got dimes that's slab, $20 wet bags
The way I'm flyin through for this paper, I'm gettin jet-lag
I'm the reason yall niggas stopped smokin stress bags
Wanna blow piff, Get dipped, Tryna pop tags
While yall gettin little money on the strip
Shit get a little ugly on the strip, Call the cops fast
A couple niggas stood, Mad niggas fell
Everybody heard about it cause my name ring bellz

[Tommy Whispers]
I got dope verses for sale, two for five
Because out of two out of five niggas don't write your rhymes
Stop frontin, I don't give credit so just dead it
My lines is authentic, I done bagged up a half a key
Of this rap potency with the relish, Spread it
All through your hood, Shoot it up like diabetics
Better duck low from flying pellets
Niggas tryna through somethin back, But I aint get it
I'm headed to the top like suds in a bottle, Bout to pop out the nozzle
Ski mask and snow goggles, Thrown off the gattos(?)
I got you, Two bodies popped up like waffles
I'm hostile, Sawed off your eyes, Blood in your nostril

[Chorus]

[Jew Dew]
Ayo, I does my thing, From Marcy to Beijing my name ring
If it's poppin' in on, I don't wanna talk
My gun lift niggas up, Show my support
And I live how I think, So fear my thoughts
I carry long shit, I can't wear no shorts
I'm not impressed, These niggas hatin in the closet
Like R. Kelly they stressed, They that much sexed
I don't give a fuck, I clean em' up like a mess
They know I'm comin and prayin to God like I'm an AIDS test
Move over, Leave stage left
The trey pound live, And the 12 gauge rep nigga
My metaphors is better, Yours will never make it
You better pause, I'm for the cause, I gotta break it
This is generation hatred, The matrix is hell
For all my niggas in jail we ring bells (Yo, Yo)

[Trife Diesel]
Look at me now, Head up in the clouds, Mamma so proud
To my brothers, Look your baby boy is holdin it down
Me and my niggas kept the block hot while lightin the hood up
Coulda swore we was track stars when the cars used to pull up
From, Tourin in Europe, To ballin in Vegas
In the back of my mind, I knew I was destined for greatness
As a youth I was young and tenacious
Till you said I was bright as a light bulb, Because I was one of they favorites
Now thereÂ’s c-notes, Bulgin out the pockets of my pea-coat
Inhalin the finest weed smoke, Crusin on speed boats
Angel hair pasta appetizer with cheese toast
Fly some helicopters, Overlooking the ski slopes
My peers keep waxing they ears with dirty teeth(?)
We grind bosses, Fuckin bad bitches on dirty sheets
We hold heat, Bust at police, And never tell
But everybody here bout it cause we ring bells. (Ring Bells Echo)

[Outro: Trife Diesel]
Shout out to LL
Pockets is swell
We got the mumps
Acme money over here man, (Hahaha)
Laugh at ya niggas man, Yall can't see us
Marcy to Stapleton, (Marcy to Stapleton Echo)
We call it Stars
Starsky and Hutch, Break a dutch, (Break a Dutch Echo)
Get thrown in the cobra clutch
Fuck it, That's what it is (That's What it is Echo)</pre>
