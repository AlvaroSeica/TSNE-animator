HOOK
And your beauty goes on and on
And I've been waiting to tell you
It goes into 'finity and beyond
It goes on and on and on
 
VERSE 1
Uh Yeah!
Girl you're my jackpot I been gambling too long
Time to cash out take my winnings and get home
I can't describe this feeling is unknown
I don't want to rush but the temptation is too strong
I'm tryna read your mind and hear your body talk
All the signs you giving me is telling me to go
Cause I want you in the worst way
Treat you like every day is your birthday (birthday)
And anything you want I can fulfill that
Your body is a wonderland can I feel that
I never want another man to ever feel that
The world hears my heart beating can you feel that
Premeditated mind trying to plan stuff
I'm trying to steal your heart put your hands up
In my custody me and you alone
I can stare at you forever cause your beauty goes on
 
HOOK
And your beauty goes on and on
And I've been waiting to tell you
It goes into 'finity and beyond
It goes on and on and on
(But you don't hear me though)
Goes on and on Yeah and on and on Yeaahhhh
Goes on and on Yeah yeah yeah
 
VERSE 2
To infinity beyond this is the women of my dreams
Gotta have this lady as my queen
Royalty you are intelligent in the mind
One step ahead keeps you on your grind
Yeah just say the word and I'll max out
Give you what you never had watch you spaz out
I'm on your team sweatin for you till the last drop
Act a fool for my girl mascot (yeah)
Premeditated mind tryna plan stuff
I'm bout to steal your heart put your hands up (hayyy)
In my custody me and you alone
I can stare at you forever cause your beauty goes on
 
HOOK
And your beauty goes on and on
And I've been waiting to tell you
It goes into 'finity and beyond
It goes on and on and on
(But you don't hear me though)
 
BRIDGE
Oh, the way you make me feel (the way you make me feel)
You got it going on (you got it going on)
You knock me off my feet girl (uh huh)
My lonely days are gone (yeeaahhh)
The way you make me feel (the way you make me feel)
You got it going on (you got it going on)
You knock me off my feet girl (you knock me off my feet girl)
My lonely days are gone (yeeaahhh)
You don't know how beautiful you are (you don't know how beautiful)
We can live so large
Drive the car we can go wherever you like
You stole my heart
You're the brightest star
You're the best by far
 
HOOK
And your beauty goes on and on
And I've been waiting to tell you
It goes into 'finity and beyond
It goes on and on and on
It goes on and on
And I've been waiting to tell you
It goes into INFINITY and beyond
It goes on and on and on
But you don't hear me though (3 X's)
