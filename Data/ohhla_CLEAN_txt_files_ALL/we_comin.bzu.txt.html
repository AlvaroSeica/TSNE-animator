Song:   We Comin' for Ya
Typed by: Cno Evil

[sample from "Zu Warriors"]
I first saw the Zu immortals doing an expedition lead by my father
We shared a common dream, to prove that the Legend of Zu was not a myth
But reality

[Intro: Raison the Zoo Keeper]
Ya'll muthafuckas still hanging around
Ya'll niggas ain't lay down, and stay the fuck down?
What ya'll thought ya'll wasn't gonna see us?
Ya'll wasn't gonna see the Zu? Nigga, we here, nigga!
12 O'Clock, Merdoc, Shorty Shitstain, Buddha Monk
Nigga, we here, nigga, ya'll niggas best to lay the fuck down
You heard? What the fuck is ya'll thought? Huh
Ya'll dont want me to kill again!

[Chorus: Preacherman]
We're comin' for ya... Zu's comin' for ya
We're comin' for ya... Zu's comin' for ya

[Hook: Preacherman w/ Buddha Monk ad-libs]
When the bullets start flying, people start dying
Cuz they're ain't no denying, man
That the Zu ain't playing, do ya dig what I'm saying?
Or the gun will go bang

[Buddha Monk]
Most of the cats out make me laugh
Got a piece of the corner, and you think you a man?
And I don't care what you got in your hand
When the Zu come through, bet we eat on this land
This chamber clutch bang fucks, chain the rust with dirty thoughts
Brooklyn Zu, the new holocaust
I break bones, by breaking bones, take crews in home
And throw your bitch a dirty bone

[Merdoc]
I hung with all of us, we make bread to break it up
Medina warriors, when we came, they buckled up
I'm in to fast cars, Olde English the house vote
Pretty bitches that deep throat, and damn a nigga toke
My Zu niggas really do roll, ya'll niggas don't know?
Ya'll candy ass niggas is casserole
I sent a smoke signal, and my niggas a large biscuit
Get on some 'go-get-you' and burn you with dirty pistols

[Raison the Zoo Keeper]
Y'all fuckas better off dead, fucking living in sin
Slave from a mental death, ya blood I require, bitch
I'll send you to hell fire, time for you to retire
When I enter, Glory be's my name
It was always so bitchin' and it will always be
You ain't hear me on that shit; a Nigga Please?
I'm the father of creation, God of the Universe
I created Adam, and I gave you Eve

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Raison the Zoo Keeper]
See I told ya'll muthafuckas to lay down, and stay the fuck down
See ya'll hard headed ass niggas, ya'll some big headed ass niggas
Ya'll don't want me to kill again, I'm telling you...

[Shorty Shitstain]
Come on, waste it, tuck ya Timex, honey
Got money on my mind, and ain't a damn thing funny, bout ta
Heat up the streets, with this hardcore technique
If you could see how I see, you can peep the recipe
I'm Brooklyn bound, I'm holding it down
Got all my Cuffie's around
Straight from Medina, where niggas is lost and not found
Step into my zone and you bound to get crowned

[Popa Chief]
And if you want it, you got it, here it is, both barrels
Kid, why ain't your jaw slapping now, nig?
Teeth to chattering, your knees to knocking
I guess that nigga was doing all the talking
It's the O.B.Z.U. cannibal, don't feed the animals
Lock me up, in a cage like Hannibal
Lectur, Popa Chief, supa Ninja
Security double, can't stop the gate crashers

[12 O'Clock]
We back again, ripping tracks again
Niggas wanna don't y'all relax, my friend
We pack 'em in, hit the stage with a bottle of gin
You front, niggas, crack your chin
See the Bedstuy dudes laugh at men
Holding that coward ass pig like forty plus ten
See my whole styles move like wind, watch my brain be the paper
And my thoughts be the pen

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Raison the Zoo Keeper]
Yeah, see, ya'll muthafuckas ain't believing us
Ya'll ain't see how it was coming
Ya'll ain't know how it was coming
Once you know that you had laid, got laid the fuck down
That was it! Know what I'm sayin'
That's how it's going down right now, knowhatimsayin'
Ya'll niggas don't know, we got to kill again right now
It's the muthafucking Zu Ninjaz up in here!

[K-Blunt]
See you over there, try'nna hide, nigga
I dip-dip-dive, your inside like a knife, nigga
Should of never left your iron, nigga
Think five times, before you come outside, nigga
And come around these hungry niggas
Kings in the concrete jungle, eat your tender viddles
Breakfast, lunch and dinner, ya lost in the source
First place! No beginner

[5 Foot Hyper Sniper]
Desparado, I keep hollows, drink liquor from the bottle
I hang with vato's from Morocco
I hear the word, we hit you up with glocks and calico's
Now your dressed in blood, taco
That's beef, they call Irie little 'ief
Just look at it as, I love to trick or treat
I'm nothing sweet, I'm a beast
I'm cold bananas, here comes the lights, the cameras

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Raison the Zoo Keeper]
This is it right here, knowhatimsayin?
Ya'll niggas don't want me to kill again
The Zoo Keeper letting ya'll muthafuckas know
That ya'll niggas gon' lay the fuck down
And stay the fuck down, and that's how we gon' do it
That's how that work, you heard? Yea
Cuz ya'll niggas don't want me to kill again
