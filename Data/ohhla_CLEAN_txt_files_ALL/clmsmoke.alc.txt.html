[Alchemist]
I want to smoke til my brain is numb
til I cant feel nothing and the pain is done
take the good from the bad thats how the game is won
cause the sun only comes out when the rain is done
and when I exhale the smoke I let the problems float
when I blow out a cloud I let the drama go
all the bullshit, the issues, all the gossip goes
all the rumors, all the whispers, all the talk just goes
all this money in my pocket and I still feel broke
I let go of all the nonsense and I calmly smoke
{*light that up, light that up*}
theres nothing that can make me angry
so take it up with God thats the way that he made me
or take it up with pops thats the way that he raised me
or blame it on the game for the way that it paved me
then blame it on the money for the way that it changed me
and blame it on my lifestyle and say that I'm crazy
and blame it on the {*hitting herb sound*} trying to say that I'm lazy
theres nothing that you can say thats makin or breakin me
and when I blow the smoke out it takes all the problems away from me
let go of all the nonsense and I calmly smoke

[Evidence]
I want to smoke so my eyes bleed so they don't see my pain they just think its weed
use the trees so they don't see my game they just think I'm green
inhale deep my problem shrink away
God forgive my sins tomorrows another a new day
its like the smoke is novacane easin my brain
from the world going on outside I stay sane
{*hitting sound*} WAY OUT! I don't smoke to forget
before I hit this hold my head God bless the dead
and I don't hold regrets and after I hit this I don't listen, fuck what you said!
hahaha, you know greed was never part of my weed plan
its fire blame the life of murder he wrote
I let go of all the nonsense and calmly smoke

[Styles P]
I take long tokes c'mon folks
Ain't in the world like strong smoke
we only blowing green shit at least when you know a pope
youd know what I mean if you was born broke
raised in the ghetto where theres nothing but torn folks
what, torn house, torn heart, torn clothes
I just blew 4 got another 4 rolled
what I got today shit only Lord knows
so I exhale inhale again did it for my little man
cause he's in jail again, need bail again
got to get rid of this shitty feelin
alchemist get your niggas higher than a new york city building
{*ROLL ANOTHER ONE AND ANOTHER ONE*}
soul diesel haze, kush mixed with the bubble gum call it troublesome
cause the only thing that calms the ghost is a deep beat
zone out and calmly smoke what what {*smoke smoke*}</pre>
