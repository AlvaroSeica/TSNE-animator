[Chorus x 2]
It's about awareness, education
Spreading knowledge and information
To everyone through communication
So we understand what were facing

[Verse One]
What we think is true today
Will be updated tomorrow, the only constant is change
Human understanding is always emerging
And developing with the more that were learning
And the main factor behind
Almost every advancement that's improved our lives
Is technology, derived from science
What's deemed possible, we constantly defy it
From thinking that our planet was flat
To the sun revolving around the earth as fact
And believing the cause of illness were demons
To the wonders of modern medicine that were seeing
Think back to the electric light
To when the Wright brothers airplane first took flight
To penicillin, to the cellular phone
To internet access in millions of homes
Today, what we consider commonplace
Would have been unimaginable in ancient days
So one thing we can assume for sure
There will be things we can't even fathom in the future
Technology doesn't seem to slow
It can lead us on a path of continuous growth
And currently the tools that we have available
Could transform humanity in ways you couldn't even know
Into a world that's balanced and humane
People are free and the environment's sustained
The only way this will happen is if we work
Together, for the benefit of everyone on this earth

[Chorus x 2]
It's about awareness, education
Spreading knowledge and information
To everyone through communication
So we understand what were facing

[Verse Two]
Free market economist Adam Smith
Claimed prosperity came from self-interest
As the act of competition would provide
People with the motivation to survive
However, what he forgot to see
Is this type of system will always lead
To social stratification and abuse
Corruption and power in the hands of a few
It's dangerous, this is our reality
And in society the dominant mentality
When it pays to be selfish and damage the planet
Ethics and honesty are a disadvantage
If a product is rare, the price will rise
Lower the supply, profits will be high
That's why it's beneficial for businesses to lie
To manipulate the value of the products they provide
So in order to make money, Oil companies
Limit their production deliberately
The last thing they want is alternative energies
That are cheap and could make their industry obsolete
And so the public has no clue
As to what our real possibilities include
With geothermal power, solar, wind and wave
There's no need to ever burn fossil fuels again
There's no reason why every car on the road
At the moment couldn't be electrical
We actually do have total energy
Without the need for pollution by any means
And we also possess the technology
That could enable us to feed every single human being
And benefit all of humanity
But these developments are held back purposely
The only way this establishment will change
Is if we refuse to participate
And stop supporting a system that's unequal
âTil we transfer the power to the will of the people

[Chorus x 2]
It's about awareness, education
Spreading knowledge and information
To everyone through communication
So we understand what were facing</pre>
