Song:   Monster Inside Me
Typed by: @4en6

I don't wait for full moons, I'm killing nightly
You wanna find me, I'm embedded in your psyche
The chances of you getting out alive, not likely
(I feel like, there's a monster inside me)
What are the odds that this poison is ivy
Go ahead, push my buttons, try me
Damn, his death was so untimely
(I feel like, there's a monster inside me)
 
Fuck, what do I do about these evil thoughts
(Act them out)
I really want you to see my art
(He talking shit)
Say it with your chest, so I can reach your heart
I know its bad but I'd love to see you and your soul apart
Could tell you how this ends, and I didn't see it start
You hated but I stayed on top of the flow, and didn't need an ark
Shit, I ain't fucking with these animals
I'm hungry all day, don't get caught up in these mandibles
Hannibal, played by actors my role never switch
He's a cannibal, understandable but shit
You'll lose your fucking lunch if you saw my grocery list
And I could tell you this, I'm not eating any grits
Inner city youth, wont be the only ones at risk
All pussies catch a fist and I promise when it hits
By the time the flesh rips, it's embedded to the wrist
I'm as crazy as it gets, hold on let me drown this fish
 
I don't wait for full moons, I'm killing nightly
You wanna find me, I'm embedded in your psyche
The chances of you getting out alive, not likely
(I feel like, there's a monster inside me)
What are the odds that this poison is ivy
Go ahead, push my buttons, try me
Damn, his death was so untimely
(I feel like, there's a monster inside me)
 
And it can't be contained in a cage or with a leash
(Look there's so many to eat)
Ill guess ill go and have a feast
(Maybe we)
Shut the fuck up it's my turn to speak
It's all these vampires, werewolves, demons and beasts
And I'm a monster, so I feel I gotta compete
These niggas think it's a games, and I'm not playing with you cheats
So you being deceased, is definitely in reach
I'm a creature from the sea, so the flow I'm immersed in
An amphibian in surf and turf, I'll be working
Blunt trauma got them hurting, now I heard he needs a surgeon
Shit I do it all, and there's no change with my service
But there is a price, you'll get a good bye without the purchase
The monster in me is a curse, but I'm even worse in person
I've realized my purpose, I'm supposed to be the evil guy
So don't be surprised that I don't care about your feeble lives
It'll be the birds 3 when I let this eagle rise
 
I don't wait for full moons, I'm killing nightly
You wanna find me, I'm embedded in your psyche
The chances of you getting out alive, not likely
(I feel like, there's a monster inside me)
What are the odds that this poison is ivy
Go ahead, push my buttons, try me
Damn, his death was so untimely
(I feel like, there's a monster inside me)
 
I can feel it lurking, is that why I'm smirking
(Are you getting nervous)
No, wait, I'm observing
(Sure you want to do this)
Yeah I'm certain
(They proved that their worthless)
Fuck it so, I feel that their deserving
They're gonna get acquainted with eels and see urchins
I'm a fire breather and this world is my circus
(Look, now he's playing dead, that's a horrible diversion)
He's not playing, this is his last act, drop curtain
 
I don't wait for full moons, I'm killing nightly
You wanna find me, I'm embedded in your psyche
The chances of you getting out alive, not likely
(I feel like, there's a monster inside me)
What are the odds that this poison is ivy
Go ahead, push my buttons, try me
Damn, his death was so untimely
(I feel like, there's a monster inside me)</pre>
