[Tyler, the Creator]
Bitches think I'm crazy but I'm normal
I just come off as a psycho maniac when I'm performin
That's an act so I don't bore you to death cause I adore you
And it's the summer so

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Can you meet me by the lake
At the park, or in your room?

[Tyler, the Creator]
You can bring your bitches, I'ma bring my nigg-ars
You can practice liking I, I'ma practice that guitar baby
It's summer camp, Golf Wang, where the talking trees are
You and girls can roll if you

[Chorus]

[Frank Ocean]
If you meet me by the pier, bring the peer, we can menage
Ooh, your girlfriend Nicki gots the back I like to massage
I'll be in the city with them actresses, the Nissan
is down there in the bottom of the lake
I'll make sure you have a good time, a good time
I'll make sure it's a good time, a good time for you

[Chorus]

[Tyler, the Creator]
Love sick, where's the clinic aid? We're young
Fun is what we're having; fuck it, pour a glass of lemonade
It's snowcone and Pop Tarts, I got heart and I got you
Let me take a dip and you can take a break
That's only if you meet me by the lake
(Could you meet me by the lake around ten?)

{*silence for 14 seconds*}

[Syd 1]
Meet me at the lake around ten (come through)
Just meet me at the lake around ten (it's cool to kick it)

[Chorus]
Meet me by the lake at ten
If I'm not there just call
And if you need a way there
I'll ride you on my handlebars

[Syd 1] + [Chorus]

[Syd 2]
Kissin under moonlight
I can bring you to our tree house
We'll be fuckin on the rooftop
If you're not down, we can just make out

[Syd 3]
Meet me at the lake around ten (come through)
Just call

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Come alone
Yeah, I like, nature
Brother life jacket, cause you'll need it
where we're goin, take a dip
The water's pretty deep</pre>
