"Heat by the waist, for those who playa hate" - Rah Digga sample *repeatead*

[Intro: Leviathan]
Yeah, what it do, do my niggas
You know there's a lot of muthafuckas out here talking shit
We about to give ya'll a ear full of this shit
Yeah, have your nose wide open and that's why the kid...
Take with that... yes sir..

[Leviathan]
Fatalistic, ballistic, hit you from close distance
Persistent, relentless, burn like hell sentence
Beretta's chop Madonna's, like piranha's, now they gone us, kid
Uh-huh yeah, double barrel at your chest, get, block fate
Better pray to inner heavens, that you hate was your last mistake
Busting out of cages, like the rules, out that gunbook
Homeboy, I'm never shook, I usually need a second look
Not a crook, but I'm crooked, don't care
How you took it, need a Cali born, play the game, watch me cook it
Heat's on my waist, make holes in your face, I gotta... uh-huh, yeah
Take and get my black gauge, out to spray up the games
Hot like sunrays, casting busters away
Don't play, this shit happens everyday
Trigger happy thirsty niggas ain't got nothing to say, but...
Yeah, sometimes you gotta give these what they really want
Knowhatimsaying? My nigga Lo told me that, knuckle up on these chumps, yeah..
Number one, top gun, Alcatraz, lay 'em all
Where you at nigga? Break 'em off something
Break 'em off something, break 'em off something
Get 'em... music...

This is www Gun In Your face dot com
The World Series of Poker, gone in 60 seconds, I drop bomb
I'm from L.A., and the projects I'm from, is torn down
They blast from a shotgun, black roses and thorns found
Laws in England, produce the first police force, so niggas lost
I'm the phantom of the megaplex, bitch, The Holocaust
Mega-science superhuman power, battle plan, thrill you
My rhymes take you to outskirts of town, and fucking kill you
The secret super power aircraft, cold like Alaska
To kill me is like trying to find which snake, killed Cleopatra
I'm slippery like the catfish, hassle mechanich Johnny Appleseed
You forty-five will fall to your sixteen
Slump eater, Peter Pan at the window, knock severe feathers
Smuggle the winter fall, Alcatraz, man listen
I swallow a gun and go to San Quintin
Jail house night, despite, lose your sight fight
Steal out the lies, sinister

[Onslot]
Bitch nigga, rich nigga, stay up out my business
Don't think I wont pop you and clap your witness
Real shit, I don't even wanna take it there
But if you wanna play that game, I gotta make it fair
I'm a good nigga, so I ain't above resolving issues
If you make an issue and issue, I gotta get you
I ain't gon' be jealous when my girlfriend kiss you
Them hollow tips rip tissue, you know I wont miss you
You stupid ass niggas, ignorant, imcompotent
I take your whole family out then vacate your continent
I've been in pain my whole life, how you think I feel?
I've traveled to hell and back and I still keep it real
Nigga, I ain't got skills, I just speak from the heart
Bust slugs through the mic and rip the speakers apart
Onslot, I'mma say my name til ya'll remember it
I'm working hard now, so later now I reap the benefits</pre>
