[Mr. Complex]
One of my hair-brained schemes is to
Chase my shadows after,
My smoking pipe, dreams it,
Seems i got a fiends just,
Forming up coats, i make it seam easy,
Some beg to differ, coke if ya,
Got time i'll show ya,
With a rhyme and blow ya,
Mining through ya,
Hot head and spool ya,
Like thread and fool ya,
Like major look, off the major Steve Austin took his bionics
Back to the for justin, federal soaking when I was not busting
Im not joking, im not chris tucker, muthafucka, I'm provoking
People I is see through, the cracks off the skulls
With the, facts and the fiction, im like dynamite with
Dynamic diction, man the way i be swinging it and swerving it
And shit you'd feeling that you deserving
Feelings that you deservin'
Feelings that you deservin'
Feelings that huh          

Chorus: Mr. Complex

Do you got a minute, for me to get in it,
To you got time to check this rhyme
What you say, what, you want me to turn it up
Its grabbibg you it's stabbing you all in your mind

Do you got a minute, for me to get in it,
To you got time to check this rhyme
What you say, what, you want me to turn it up
Its grabbibg you it's stabbing you all in your mind

[Mr. Complex]
I'm mean, see I, cut you clean I dissolve your spleen
It go, <ooh meee="" ohh="">--Sound effect?? 
Partialary, the martial artist fury, fister??
You're in the Mister, Mister Complex
I'm so compelling,  and ooh ooh ooh I'm telling
I'ma drop a, dime in the rhyme, a penny in the well
Shits you not, I'ma really tell
I'ma drop a quarter in the water, it's a slaughter
My skill levels way empty, your so low
so slow, trickle down, you try to, no flow
You waiting like a nickle, you end up in the jars 
with the counter with the pickle and pigs feet
Then I switch the labels from the squid meat
Yess I did heat the beat, but i was cool about it
You like a pool with no agua, you like a fool without it
You got the kids just jumping and then staying dry
That's why the get mad kick you in the chin and poke you in the eye
