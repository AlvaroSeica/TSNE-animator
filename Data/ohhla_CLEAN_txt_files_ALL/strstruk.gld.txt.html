[Santigold]
Do it again, and I'll see you tomorrow
I want to get it; you've got something to borrow
Can't make it feel right on my own
That's when I turn you on again
I buy it but it don't measure up
What is the missed ingredient?

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I, I see you fade
I-I-I, I see you fade away

[Santigold]
Under the skin, it's not so easy to swallow
Don't reel me in, to find my dreams are so hollow
What is it you got I don't get?
I watch you fumblin again
Look dreamy behind your cigarette
Know it ain't true now

[Chorus]

[Santigold speaking S-LOW-LY]
We all find you easy so amuse us
Don't get too heady you might abuse luck
You're starstruck

[Chorus]</pre>
