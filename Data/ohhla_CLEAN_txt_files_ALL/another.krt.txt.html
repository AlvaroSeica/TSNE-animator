[Intro: excerpt from the movie "Bamboozled"]
"I want you all to go to your windows
 Go to your windows and yell out
 Scream with all the life that you can muster up
 inside your bruised, assaulted and battered bodies
 'I am sick and tired of being a nigger~!'"

[Chorus 1]
I don't wanna be another N.I.G.G.E.R.
Tell the government, I don't wanna be another N.I.G.G.E.R.
Tell them white folk, I don't wanna be another N.I.G.G.E.R.
Tell them black folk, I don't wanna be another N.I.G.G.E.R.
Tell the world, I don't wanna be another N.I.G.G.E.R.

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Waiting with my hands out
Broke in the hood, they give a damn bout
Bragging to my homie bout the hoes I fucked
Drinking bottles after bottle, plus I smoke too much
I never had a job that would pay me well
I took what I could cause they gave me hell
Spend what I stole on some clothes and kicks
My ex-girl say I won't amount to shit
but she suck and fuck when my car roll up
Tried to fuck her sister but she talk too much
Her momma shake her head whenever I come round
Whatever high I had when I saw her might come down
I barely go to church but I say I will
I bow my head right before I eat my meal
The world's fucked up and they claiming I'm to blame
It's a damn shame, cause

[Chorus 1]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Waiting on a play to come through
Chilling with my homeboys, plotting on you
Watching movies how to come up quick
Recruiting young niggas I can come up with
Barely read books, but they down to shoot
Live life breaking rules, they got something to prove
Parents ain't around, they got nothing to lose
Wave the tool on a fool for some brand new shoes
Little child running wild in the streets
Wanna be a G so he look up to me
Try to hit the block and make a name
Claim he caught a body, now he Gotti and feeling all the same
till the family of the victim come knocking
Milling through the corners of the ghetto till they shot him
Youth still dying and they claiming I'm to blame
It's a damn shame, cause

[Chorus 1]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Always tryna sell you something
Don't really know shit, but try to tell you something
Tap dance if you want him to
Could've fed the hungry but he bought them jewels
Won't ever look back cause he gotta keep moving
Even if he leave his own people "Bamboozled"
Taking credit like he did it by himself
Too much pride to realize that he really had help
Only judge a man by his wealth
He ain't me, so he can't feel how I felt
He saw me walking and he ain't look back
Too scared, we make eye contact
So he can say he didn't see me when he drove by
and I could say he didn't see me and it's alright
He just want the fame from the game, it's a shame
I bet he think I'm just another N.I.G.G.E.R.

[Chorus 2]
Tell the government, I don't wanna be another N.I.G.G.E.R.
Tell them white folk, I don't wanna be another N.I.G.G.E.R.
Tell them black folk, I don't wanna be another N.I.G.G.E.R.
Tell the world, I don't wanna be another N.I.G.G.E.R.</pre>
