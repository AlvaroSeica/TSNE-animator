We no surrender
We no pretender
We bang bang

[Jhaz]
Yeah
No surrender, no pretender
II Tru my crew come thick
Family behind us
You don't wanna see this Mo' Thug clique
To swift to be faded
Just hated by them foes
Throw blows, bow down hoes
Mo' Thug handle this like pros
I'm too cold
Never catch me slippin' muthafucka set up
II Tru to my dyin' day
Rollin' with AJay
Mo' Thug love nigga what
You got your blue suit
You got your nine
But if you pop one time
My trues comin' back uptight and I'm a end mine
I'm nothin' but
One of the best females
Pumpin' in your ear
Fillin' the air with nothin' but potent ass bud smells

[Tombstone]
We strapped with Bone hit the deck
On the worst of the wreck
Strapped with the .38 and TEC
Hey man how we love them TEC's
Ain't gotta dump 'em
But when we find the muthafuckin' snitch
Lynch 'em
Head straight for the ditch
Victims say we got a snake to snitch
Goin' to the cut so we can break the bitch
How you want the nigga 
Red on on this blue suit fried
When he died we showed the nigga he could never ride 
Or fuck with the souljahs
That glide on the Clair side
Runnin' with gauges
Flippin' your pages
Fuck the cages
Shoulda known not to fuck with the thugs all militant
Hell yeah we chill but we ill to defence of livin'
Still can't help the way we roll
In the land so cold
Eveybody's singin' the devil's song along the road

[Boogy Nikke]
I'm takin' the lives of all them seargents, lieutenants we pin this
How far are you willing to go
When you test us we test nuts boy
Better part the sea and pin the scriptures we read 'em
Gotta get 'em where it hurt
Gotta get their kids first
Now my subject be the envy in me
I'm wantin' your soul to burn in hell
And dwell and tell the past who put you there
Your family was soon to follow
As I complete my intro on your people
God bless the children though
It was business never personal
Better pray to the Lord for your soul
Run away through the tunnel of the light
Can you see me see me

[Krayzie Bone]
Boy you better believe it
Your people fin to feel it
When the coffin top drop the box lock shut
Toss 'em in the back of the hearse
And I wish I could watch the cop's crooked body rott
And thugs will all in time
Takeover the world
Collect the minds of all the little girls and boys
And pearls to a another dimension
Where really is just us fuck the system
Is ya feelin' me now
'Cause I ain't got time
To be fuckin' with the street weak leakin' mind
You know it's cool to be thuggin' on '99
I parlay break bustas and niggas that's on the grind
Niggas tryin' to creep up on ah come up
But I betcha nigga come my way you sprayed
You knew we was real
We really do smoke blunts
We do all our own stunts
Fuck cops a whole bunch
So they wanna die
So we fin to kill 'em
Hit the copper chop 'em up with the M-11 
Now feel the pain
We the T-H-U-G be fuckin' souljah
Niggas is sure we got the real shit for ya
Never respect 'em ready to blow 'em out ya town now
Come on y'all we take a pow pow
That gauge that gauge we spray they lay they lay
What a wonderful day
Get up buck and fuck 'em on up
When they pull you to side and they tryin' to put the cuffs on
That's the perfect time to get it pump
Then you reach up in the glove
Hold your breath then get ya buss on
Let 'em feel the round
Or hear the sound
Of the twelve gauge eruption
Destruction we've made
Now the peelin' is through and we got your pay

[Krayzie Bone]
We no surrender
We no pretender
We bang bang</pre>
