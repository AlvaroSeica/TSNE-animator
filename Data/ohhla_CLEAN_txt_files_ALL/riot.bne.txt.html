[Flesh-N-Bone]
Yeah, yeah
Unh huh, unh huh, callin' all my trues (trues)
Mo Thug family bringin' it to ya once again
Callin' all my thugstas, thugstas, thugstas
Thugstas and hustlas, hustlas, hustlas
Callin' all my thugstas, thugstas, thugstas
Thugstas and hustlas

We the tightest, trues humbly united
Family never divided, be the survivors
Mo Thug riders comin' and set it off
Start the riot (And halt!)
My nigga, the Fifth Dawg breakin' it off so raw
And let me set it off once again
I'm ready for battle
Well, if it's on with the war
Then let the games begin
My friend, you feelin' the wrath Mo Thugs steady bring
When we hit the scene, we gonna ? everything
Listen to the fat lady sing
It'll be over, so tell 'em why
You better get out of my way, clear my path
My nigga put 'em in a bullet bath
Wig-splitters, and niggas
I love when I blast my trigger
Ready and willing soon, they tried
I'm buckin' and killin' police - leave 'em in the streets
With their badges all bloody, fuck 'em all
Ain't no peace
Strapped, the heat on thugs
They poppin' the nines, it's time to get with ya
Bet I won't miss ya, bullet hit ya
Better hope you survive, when I come get ya

[Flesh-N-Bone]
We the tightest, trues humbly united
Family never divided, be the survivors
Mo Thug riders comin' and set it off, start the riot
We on the mash, collectin' cash
At last, my niggas
We finally made it up out of the ghetto
But I want cheddar, bet I never knew none could fade it
Rollin' with gauges
And whole lot of ammunition in my trunk
If there's any chalk left when I get done
I'll reach for my shit ? they're dumped
Bump, thump and my people down your block
Thugsta mentality straight from the Glock Glock
Let off my heat, pop shot 'til the cop drop
Daily, my shit don't stop
Who aim to try and tame me?
I'm gonna mangle 'em, then bang they brain
And strangle fools who fuck with our name
I crept and I came with game
I'm tellin' y'all, "Fuck the fame."
I'm out to get paid, that's what I envision
Givin' ya a hit you fiend and listen nigga
My trues still on the mission, yeah.

[Flesh-N-Bone]
We the tightest, trues humbly united
Family never divided, be the survivors
Mo Thug riders comin' and set it off
Start the riot
Let's carry out will after will
My deals are handled
Fulfilled with a mighty power
Up against forces of evil
And we have been waitin'
At last for the final hour
How I pray to the Lord
Heavenly Father, will He have got mercy?
I'd rather disperse you into the line of fire
And gun they buck when they hurt you
Hit 'em with a curse and you got glocks
And it servin' niggas murdered mo
Givin' up shots to the Double Glock all day long
Niggas steady drop P's
Don't even (fall) touch these
So picture the St. Clair thugstas
And we put Cleveland on that goddamn map
Steady pap papped
Now, bustas, yeah, come stumble into my world
So you can have peace, and you can have harmony
Cause any harm to me, we can afford
'Cause I got a army, nigga</pre>
