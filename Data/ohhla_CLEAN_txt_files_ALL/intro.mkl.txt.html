[Masta Killa]
My devastating hot East New York mentality
Keep me on point for my million dollar salary
Heavyweight lyric, never lost one calorie
Fat stack, drug dealings, styles, the black Ac'
Nickle-plated macs, we pack, chrome techs, yes
With one single idea, everything appeared here
Understand it makes my truth, crystal clear
Hey, yo, step out of Candyland, seems the old rumor is
Blacks become immune to shit, we never did like
Cross colored clothes, crossing over, getting crossed out
Kriss Krossing, we bossing, oh, of course, we
I'm a knowledge seed, I want action, that's what I need
Never no doubt in my mind, it's to rhyme
Olympic torch flaming, we burn so sweet
The thrill of victory, defeat, it's not meant for me
Victorious, no opponent, that blast through components
Jamel Irief, raising hell with the flavor
Smoking on the mic, like Smokin' Joe Frazier</pre>
