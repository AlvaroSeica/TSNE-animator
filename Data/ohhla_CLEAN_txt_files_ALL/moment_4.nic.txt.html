[Nicki Minaj]
I fly with the stars in the skies, I am no longer tryin to survive
I believe that life is a prize, but to live doesn't mean you're alive
Don't worry about me and who I fire
I get with that desire, its my empire
And yes I call the shots, I'm the umpire
I sprinkle holy water upon the vampire
In this very moment am king
In this very moment I slay Goliath with the sling
This very moment I bring, put it on everythin
That I will retire with the ring
And I will retire with the crown, yes
No am not lucky am blessed, yes
Clap for the heavyweight champ, me
But I couldn't do it all alone, we
Young Money raised me, grew about in Basely
Southside, Jamaica, Queens is crazy
'Cause am still hood, Hollywood couldn't change me
Shout out to my haters sorry that you couldn't faze me
Ain't bein cocky we just vindicated
Best believe that we done this moment will be syndicated
I don't know, this night just remind me of
Everythin they deprive me of
Put your drinks up
It's a celebration everytime we link up
We done did everythin they could think of
Greatness is what we on the brink of

[Chorus- Nicki Minaj]
I wish that I could have this moment to life
To life... .to life
'Cause in this moment I just feel so alive
Alive... .alive
 {*I can have this moment- repeat 8x in background*}
I wish that I could have this moment to life 
To life... .to life
This is my moment I just feel so alive
Alive... .alive

[Drake]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh
Would I tell them hoes bow bow bow to me, drop down to your knees
Young Money the mafia that's word to Lil' Cease
I'm in a Dominican, Big Papi on tees
Doin talkin practice, all these bitches is same in the please
Shout out to the CEO, 500 Degreez
Shout out to the OBO wearin some fatigues, ohh
Niggaz wanna be friends, how coincidental
They supposed to be out here, we ain't get the memo
A young king, pay me a gold
Forty got a bunch of weed he ain't even roll
These niggaz be droppin songs they ain't even cold
Weezy on top of that nigga he ain't even home, yet
Yeah, be very afraid
These other rappers gettin bodied and carried away
Fuck it, me and Nicki Nick gettin married today
And all you bitches that be hatin can catch the bouquet
Ooh, yeah, you are a star in my eyes
You and all them white girls, party of five
Are we drinkin a little more, I can hardly decide
I can't believe we really made it, I'm partly surprised
I swear, damn this one for the books
Man, I swear this shit is as fun as it looks
Man, I'm really tryna make it more than what it is
'Cause everybody dies, but not everybody lives

[Chorus- Nicki Minaj]
I wish that I could have this moment for life
For life... .to life
'Cause in this moment I just feel so alive
Alive... .alive
 {*I can have this moment- repeat 8x in background*}
I wish that I could have this moment for life 
For life... .to life
This is my moment I just feel so alive
Alive... .alive

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]
This is my moment, I waited all my life
I can tell its time
Driftin away I'm, one with the sunset
I have become alive

[Chorus- Nicki Minaj]
I wish that I could have this moment for life
For life... .for life
'Cause in this moment I just feel so alive
Alive... .alive
{*I can have this moment- repeat 8x in background*}
I wish that I could have this moment for life 
For life... .for life
This is my moment I just feel so alive
Alive... .alive</pre>
