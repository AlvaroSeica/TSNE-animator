Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
still ballin stuntin on these hoes
yea you know just how it goes
I talk big big shit nigga
all my girls got asses like trina
boy they think just like serena
I talk big big shit nigga
and if it's new you know I'm at the mall poppin tags
I talk big big shit nigga

[Chorus]
I'm sayin nigga
niggas know I'm cocky
let me go do what the fuck I do man

[Verse 1]
boy I'm so pain pairs of new jays
bout fresher then toothpaste
I didn't mean to stunt on you niggas
but fuck it stunna told me me to stunt on you
niggas better get your girl your girl all inside of me
she said I'm way cuter in person better on tv
I'm fucking girls in the penthouse ocean view baby
get these to your girl she be coming over later
and all you new rappers ya'll just new bait
fuck 'em throw 'em in the cage
I'm the lion you the steak
ymcmb and I'm the best thing come see me nigga
what it is

[Chorus]
still ballin stuntin on these hoes
yea you know just how it goes
I talk big big shit nigga
all my girls got asses like trina
boy they think just like serena
I talk big big shit nigga
and if it's new you know I'm at the mall poppin tags
I talk big big shit nigga

[Chorus]
I'm sayin nigga
niggas know I'm cocky
let me go do what the fuck I do man

[Verse 2]
are we still talking money can we change the subject
fuck a swat watch my nigga this a rolex
I get hollywood paper now
If they already wasn't them haters gonna hate me now
hopping off the motherfucking g5 with stunna
f430 mr burn rubber
furniture from italy white marbel floor
don't be alarmed that's just my butler at the door
and I got my own chef I don't even eat out
bodyguards on payroll ready to knock your teeth out
buying all ther bottles chillin with some models
ballin everyday like I hit the lotto

[Chorus]
still ballin stuntin on these hoes
yea you know just how it goes
I talk big big shit nigga
all my girls got asses like trina
boy they think just like serena
I talk big big shit nigga
and if it's new you know I'm at the mall poppin tags
I talk big big shit nigga

[Chorus]
I'm sayin nigga
niggas know I'm cocky
let me go do what the fuck I do man</pre>
