[Lupe Fiasco]
Close your mind
close your eyes
see with your heart
how do you forgive the murderer of your father?
the ink of a scholar is worth a thousand times more than the blood of a martyr

[Lupe Fiasco]
We came through the storm
Nooses on our necks and a smallpox blanket to keep us warm
On a 747 on the pentagon lawn
Wake up the alarm clock is connected to a bomb
Anthrax lab on a west Virginia farm
Shorty aint learned to walk already heavily armed
Civilians and little children is especially harmed
Camoflouged Torahs, Bibles and glorious Qurans
The books that take you to heaven and let you meet the Lord there
Have become misinterpreted, reasons for warfare
We read 'em with blind eyes I guarantee you there's more there
The rich must be blind because they didnt see the poor there
Need to open up a park, just closed 10 schools
we dont need 'em
can you please call the fire department they're down here marchin for freedom
burn down ATV's, turn their TV's on to teach 'em and Move!

[Hook: Matthew Santos]
The more money that they make the more money that they make
The better and better they live
Whatever they wanna take whatever they wanna take
Whatever whatever it is
The more that you wanna learn the more that you try to learn
The better and better it gets
American Terrorist!

Now the poor klu klux man see that we're all brothers
Not because things are the same becuase we lack the same color
And thats green, now that's mean
cant burn his cross cause he cant afford the gasoline
Now if a muslim woman strapped with a bomb on a bus
With the seconds running give you the jitters?
Just imagine a American-based christian orginization
Planning to poison water supplies to bring the second-coming quicker
Nigga they aint livin properly
Break 'em off a little democracy
Turn their whole culture to a mockery
Give 'em coca-cola for their property
Give 'em gum, give 'em guns, get 'em young, give 'em fun
If they aint givin it up, then they aint gettin none
And dont giv 'em all naw ,man, just give 'em some
Its the paper, some of these cops must be Al-Qaeda nigga uh

[Hook: Matthew Santos]
The more money that they make the more money that they make
The better and better they live
Whatever they wanna take whatever they wanna take
Whatever whatever it is
The more that you wanna learn the more that you try to learn
The better and better it gets
American Terrorist!

It's like
Don't give the black man food, give red man liquor
Red man fool, black man nigga
Give yellow man tool, make him railroad builder
Also give him pan, make him pull gold from river
Give black man crack, glocks and things
Give red man craps, slot machines
Now bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back
Don't give the black man food, give they red man liquor
Red man fool, black man nigga
Give yellow man tool, make him railroad builder
Also give him pan, make him pull gold from river
Give black man crack, glocks and things
Give red man craps, slot machines</pre>
