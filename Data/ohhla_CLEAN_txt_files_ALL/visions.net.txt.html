[Coco O]
Time and time again, minded out my past
Damn it's so familiar, that they hardly ever last
Now they tryin to tell me, messed up out my mind
Called and saved my pain, got the ones you'll never find

It's all right {*5X*}
We can play chess all night
It's all right
We can play chess all night

[repeat 3X]
Tell me that I'm all right - tell me

[Outro]
Tell me!!
