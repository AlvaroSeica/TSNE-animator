[Verse 1]
Promoe! (Who?)
The number one public enemy
With split personality
Yeah, and both rap for anarchy
Keepin my beard long like pops in the '70s
Burnin flags, screamin "fuck the Kennedys"
Many see me as a hoodlum, at best a good bum
Lettin out anger over bass and snare drums
Fuckin up eardrums of those with high income
Holdin king Carl Gustav for ransom
Leavin Madeleine in labor pains while I'm bombin trains
Tryin to bring back the days of '36 in Spain
And y'all claim I'm too negative
Talkin 'bout Sweden's really a nice place to live
Oh, I'm supposed to be satisfied 'cause I got a fatter life
Than my brothers and sisters who die
On the other side of the planet
It's all connected, goddamnit!
If you leave the third world stranded
The first and second will soon be drowned
In the blood, sweat and tears of the people we hold down
Hold up! That's something you will never understand
Fuck that man! I'm tryin to take a stand
You might just laugh but I'm tryin to walk a righteous path
Stumblin though, drunk off of wine made from grapes of wrath
Me, I'm tired of doin the math when nothing adds up
The good's always down, the bad's up
That sucks!
Life's a bitch and then you die
Wrong! Life's a biatch and then you decide
To do something about it
Shit'll only drive you crazy if you allow it (Word)

[Verse 2]
Everyday, I wake up late in the afternoon
Thinkin to myself something gotta happen soon
I'm rackin food at the corner store to make ends meet
Spent my last dime on a hard disk and MPC
Embee, me, Cos.mic, Supreme
Put our cream to make this dream come true
Invest my life in this Looptroop crew
State got me on trial again, this time I'm innocent
But of course I got convicted 'cause they want every cent
If it ain't rent or taxes they charge me a fine
For bein at the wrong place at the wrong time
With a wrong state of mind
The state wants what's mines
But the government is thugs, so I'ma resort to crimes as well
I don't care about jail 'cause all I do all day
Anyway is lift weights and masturbate
Then I try and get it straight
'Cause the voice inside my head be keepin me awake at night
Forcin me to stay up and write
Some dope material so that I might
Turn this negative shit into positive
'Cause something gots ta give
Fuck it! I gots ta live!
Fuck it! I gots ta live!
