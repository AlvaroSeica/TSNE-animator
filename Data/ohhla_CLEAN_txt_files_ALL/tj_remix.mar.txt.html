[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Snoop D.O. Double from the L.B.C.
Smoke so much ganja them call me Marley
Everytime you see me I'm out the country
Police want to cuff me but them can't touch me
Pull me to the curb they say they smell herb
Why your car swerved? Now the ghetto birds
Swoopin down tryin to clown but it was never found
Now I gotta post bail five hundred thou'
Small change it's a small thang to a boss mayne
For my freedom I need 'em I'm a tell ya, it's all gain
That's why I got a license Loc
They say I can't do nothin but smoke over the counter dope
Yeah, if you love to smoke, put your blunts in the air and say dope, dope, dope
Yeah, we doin this now
With Snoop and Stephen, Damian came with ym crew with a style
Bow wow!!! (Bow wow!!!) When it hit yo' block
It don't matter nephew cause the shit don't stop
You try to, jam up the traffic it's drastic and pornographic
I'm mackin, mappin and crackin I stack it, pack it and wrap it

[Verse 2: Stephen Marley]
Alright! This is raggamuffin from di ghetto yutes camp
Anywey we go we seh we must leff we stamp

First ting him waan to know is where dat smell is comin from
Are you smokin marijuana and I said yes I am
Smokin marijuana and I said, yah mon
Gimme some herb and mek it burn, on di table mek it turn
All dem a talk dem still caan learn

Gimme di herb and keep yuh food
Watch di paper watch di news

[Chorus: Stephen Marley]
Pom, rom pa ba dom ba dom ba ba dom
Babba dom ba dabba dom ba dom ba ba dom
Pom, rom pa ba dom ba dom ba ba dom

[Verse 3: Damian "Jr. Gong" Marley]
Well if a ganja dem a look fah dem know where to find us
We deh inna di club wid we woman a wine up
Fi dem medical marijuana everybody a sign up
And form a union di herbalist a join up
In under, darkness it grows, bright and expose
Left your contacts at home just, follow your nose
I feel good and I said goodness knows
That's not just as far as the goodness goes
It's a great stimulant help my meal settle
When I boil a few buds in my tea kettle
And this will open up a cancer patient's appetitte
Feed up and get well and live a happy life
But now them jealous because I burn with Snoop
And now them jealous because it smell like fruits
Please don't tell me that your jealosu cause we got alot of stuff
From all the real cops and troops
Hey! More paper for the acre, more paper for Jamaica
Gong and Snoop Dogg and Muffin melody major
Now him jealous cause every goody knows us
Now him jealous cause everybody shows love
Cau a philly weh yuh pass and dem a smile and a blush
True dem see some man a star dem truly have a light crush
Now him jealous now even twice as much
Now di bwoy jealous now even twice as much
It's just a minor set back a who yuh waan call up
Every month then di super get a ting fold up
Super dreadlocks nah wear handcuffs
Seh any kind a cuff it haffi diamond cuff
Go tell dem every month then di super get a ting fold up
Go tell dem seh natty dreadlocks nah wear handcuffs
Easy papa muffin yuh ruffa than ruff
Sekkle Juju Royal yuh tuffa than tuff
Always stick togetha even when time tuff
A which fassy bright and him go shine and, Sekkle!!! Sekkle!!!

[Chorus: Stephen Marley]
Pom, rom pa ba dom ba dom ba ba dom
Babba dom ba dabba dom ba dom ba ba dom
Pom, rom pa ba dom ba dom ba ba dom
Babba dom ba dabba dom ba dom ba ba dom, yah mon</pre>
