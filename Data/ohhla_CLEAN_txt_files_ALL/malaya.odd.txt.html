[Intro]
{*imitatin the beat until 0:14*}
Yeah... Hodgy Beats, Left Brain

[Hodgy Beats]
I'm goin in, as if I'm tryin to swim
Workin on my game for you like I'm at the gym
Yammin on cats, hangin on the rim
I'm fresh from my Newbounds to the fitted brim
Beautiful, is the synonym to your name
It's a shame but you can't blame him
for sayin that, if she was a game I'd be playin that
Not playin that with strings attached
Red or blue, because I ain't bangin that
I'm rearrangin that fact
That I'm always exact, but today I'm going to extract
the scent, of sugar from your sweetness
If I'm ever sick you're my treatment
I keep you warm if yo' place don't got a heater
As lon as you seated with me in my two-seater
Seventy miles per hour, new cheetah
In a wife-beater but I won't beat ya, diva
New feature, cruise control
So I'ma sweep my feet up, I think I should keep her
Why? Because she lookin like a keeper, yeah

[Chorus]
Malaya, Malaya, wonderin how are you
I'm thinkin that, I should pick up the phone and call you
Conversations lovely, never have to argue
Over the line it's all me, and you know it's all you

(Malaya, Malaya) {*2X*}

[Hodgy Beats]
(Malaya) I'm goin in, as if I'm tryin to swim
Dolphin on the surface you can tell by the fin
In the mix, juice and gin
Slick on my steez, never rusty like tin
Baby girl, I'm here to win
Your game, it's a shame, but you can't blame him
I wanna be in your A life like Tims
even if you don't like dem
I'mma just SB Nike then, if I was a food
I'd let you bite in
You like my conversation that's why you smilin
We can get alone, isolated on our own island
Nah girl, I ain't lyin, I'm subscribin
tryin to wake up to you and the horizon
I'm full of surprises when you enter
So I'm enterprisin, tell your Bin to come out from his Laden
The sun is risin and I'm advisin
you to pay attention to my advertisement
I'm on my slicker material
Satisfying, I ain't lyin

[Chorus]</pre>
