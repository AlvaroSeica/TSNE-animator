Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Hey! Kali Baby

[Chorus: X2]
She got her backpack, and her lunch pale too
Cheatin when I'm sitting next to you/Milk would do her body good too, baby
She got her backpack, and I got a ruler for her too
Now I'm bout to take her back to school

I can tell she got that thing by the way that she walking (walking)
Love that dang a lang by the way that she talking (talking)
Baby got dem goodies, think she wanna do me,
Shes a floozy oozy wanna give it to me

She got her jack in the box plus shes a fox, might jump right off
If I get the toss, not gonna talk, lights come right off
She know I'm khali baby, mabe it's unfair
I don't care, I just wanna lay in her hair
Give me your number, well rondevue at the after set
I'm the one to stunt ya, one to if happen as of yet
Her bubble, gets me in trouble, you can call it too excel, I'm a call it double
Her back pack, she packed ejects em, she got me erect some
Now I just expect some, your bodies inviting me to a fight
That well both like, well end the night in the right light if I spoke right
BABY!

[Chorus: X2]
She got her backpack, and her lunch pale too
Cheatin when I'm sittin next to you, baby
She got her backpack, and I got a ruler for her too
Now I'm bout to take her back to school

Her back pack full of school supplies
WHOO! Her thighs make me scoop her,
Back in round like a tuba
Got a trunk on her, front keeps me wantin her
Mad at her for that, matta fact I need to have that in the back
Tap it in the sack, don't know how to act when I'm round ya
She gave me that look, like I'm about to clown ya
I hound ya for a piece of that, hows about a squeeze on that
I'm easy, like Sunday morning I'll give up my cheese for that
Thick miss, Krizz is the pick for your wish list
Get bent, you'll get to picture the bidness
She make em all geek when they view that
I told you, she got a back pack, but you already knew that

[Chorus: X2]
She got her backpack, and her lunch pale too
Cheatin when I'm sittin next to you, baby
She got her backpack, and I got a ruler for her too
Now I'm bout to take her back to school

Baby just shake ya, your money maka
Looked her up and down and said, mmm I'll take ya
Break out my wallet, pay for the watcha ma call it
Knew she had a backpack from the front, fo I saw it
Shes a stallion, got the boys hollerin, ballers all of us
Hope her and all the girls come on and follow us
Them 816 Boyz, brand new rat pack
Lookin for them girls (HEY) packin them backpacks

[Chorus: X2]
She got her backpack, and her lunch pale too
Cheatin when I'm sittin next to you, baby
She got her backpack, and I got a ruler for her too
Now I'm bout to take her back to school</pre>
