[Quinn] What a bunch of {ass}holes
[Murph] Hit it, Hesh!

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Go robot! It's your birthday!

[Hesh]
You're one year older, one year wiser
Rock and roll star, king, czar, and a kaiser
A roomful of friends, a mouthful of cake
Every present is for you, and it feels pretty great
You're the man of the hour, the V.I.P.
You get the first slice, of the P-I-E
But first blow out the candles, and make a wish
Put a smile on, cause it's your birthday BITCH~!

[Chorus]

[Quinn]
Seriously, what a bunch of {ass}holes
It's not even my birthday</pre>
