(verse 1)
May the Lord bless the child that can hold his own in this day in time
And waits for no man or the wo-man, sun rise; starts to grind
And the early cat; eats the bird that gets the worm, we find
The results always stay the same, nine out of ten tries
I'ma grind; never mind how my neighbor flips a dime into a dollar
Says the scholar from the school of hard livin
Play the cards I was given from the dealer, with a smile
Take a swallow from the Coke and then I mix it with the Crown
So surprised, I'm still alive doin fine instead of crime
I got off easy as a kid, but this karma is a bitch
You reap what you sow, niggas better learn to stitch
On the search for extra dollars, one thing you can't forget

(Hook)
Karmaaaa
It'll catch up wit'chu one day, you can ask your Mamaaaaaa
She'll say "What goes around comes back" because there's no honoooor;
Amongst theives, gotta shake the leaves and empty your armoiiiir
Because karma is a bitch, and every bitch loves dramaaaaaa

(Verse 2)
Now we've been in this game for ten years makin rap tunes
Ever since rappers was hollerin cash rules
Before it was cool to have all these tattoos
You put out negative energy, you get bad news
You hang with positive people, you win mo'
Never throw the first stone, you might miss ya window
Damn near sold my soul, that's too much info
Booked some overpriced shows that I ain't make a cent fo'
Finances in limbo, have my own family to fend fo'
Help them my kinfolk, it came back ten-fold
What goes around comes around, it'll catch up
When ya least expect it, please accept that that's just

(Hook)
Karmaaaa
It'll catch up wit'chu one day, you can ask your Mamaaaaaa
She'll say "What goes around comes back" because there's no honoooor
Amongst theives, gotta shake the leaves and empty your armoiiiir
Because karma is a bitch, and every bitch loves dramaaaaaa

(verse 3)
Simple veto, right out of a Bible bill
Prayer sayer, look at what the Bible left
Slum, heavy-set, row ton
Do the work, then you know it's gon' come
Feel good, call life good
Great day cause the night good
What I say when it write good
Yo hood is my hood, my hood and yo hood, so we all hood
But it's all about the next step, puff pass golf
The next breath, get it in and that's that
Answer to the prayers of my grand dad
Runnin through these Billie Jeans
Still Michael Jackson bad

(Hook)
Karmaaaa
It'll catch up wit'chu one day, you can ask your Mamaaaaaa
She'll say "What goes around comes back" because there's no honoooor
Amongst theives, gotta shake the leaves and empty your armoiiiir
Because karma is a bitch, and every bitch loves dramaaaaaa</pre>
