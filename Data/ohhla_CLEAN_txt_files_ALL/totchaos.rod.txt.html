[Chorus: Harry Chapin 'Cat's in the Cradle' sample]
Child arrived just the other day
He came to the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch, and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
And he was talkin' 'fore I knew it, and as he grew
He'd say I'm gonna be like you dad
You know I'm gonna be like you yeah
You know I'm gonna be like him

[Li-Mouse]
I look at my favorite rapper and what do I see
I see me, just trying to be like he, but no
I realize I gotta have my own voice
So the audience can choose me by choice
Started with 'a game of chess is like a sword fight
You must think first, before you move', right?
So I thought, and followed Tamias instructions
Recording at my house, was the new functions
Downloadable beats, nah, we don't need that
Masterpieces by Cno, make your fingers snap
So much it hurts, you need a splint
Criminals love it, the friction erases fingerprints
Watch every movie, that's influenced by them
We your 'heroes', that 'unleash', 'flying daggers' again
I was there, the night before the Bastard left Earth
Inspired us to go see what hip hop is really worth

[Chorus]

[Cno Evil]
Get trapped in my music, got a map and I'll use it
Ya'll are fumblin' the mic, too much you abuse it
I rap cuz I choosed it, attack, and won't lose it
I smash bootlegs, support the artists, like Chambermusik
Glad or mad, compose the track like G-Clef
The one who ain't boppin' his head, he must be deaf
The one who ain't already dead, reachin' his death
You ain't movin' it right, you need to move it to the left
Paragraphic glocks, my brain shoots shots
You playin' games like the back of a cereal box
Cruisin' in the S2000, with my cousin Bolo
Don't get the feeling that I walk dolo
Whether be Lil' Gotti or Bulletz, it's a Brotherhood of War
Jiggs will gladly show you to the door
25 to Life, attempted murder with verses
Like a Genius, take you Beneath the Surface

[Chorus]

[Li-Mouse]
Curses unneccesary to come across with the message
In my bed with the mic in my hand, is how I rested
Sleeps bitten, so much felt like I wet the bed
Rhyme with every breath until my, skin turns red
I don't care not one bit, if you think I'm a replica
If so, well get up out of here, fuck it, death to ya
This is us, Tamias and Musculus
Grab your sticks, and then you might slap pucks with us
Even, drink tea out of cups with us
Didn't I already say, don't fuck with us?
When we arrive on the spot, make sure you listen up
Cuz the next thing you'll know, you'll be missing us
What's the fuss, only rap politicans you can trust
Impacts from punches and kick lines turn you to dust
Next time you see us...</pre>
