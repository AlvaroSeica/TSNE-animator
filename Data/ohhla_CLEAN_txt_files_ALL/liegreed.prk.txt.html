[Mike Shinoda]
I'ma be that n-n-n-nnail in your coffin, sayin that I softened
I was duckin down to reload
So you can save your petty explanations, I don't have the patience
Before you even say it I know
You let-let-let your pride and your ego talk slick to me, no
That is not the way I get down
And look at how you lose your composure, now let me show you
Exactly how the breaking point sounds

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I wanna see you choke on your lies, swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery
Choke on your lies, swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery

[Mike Shinoda]
What is it you want me to tell you? I am not the failure
I would rather live and let be
But you came with the right kind of threat to, push me to let you
No you can't intimidate me
You di-di-di-disrespect me so clearly, now you better hear me
That is not the way it goes down
You did it to yourself and it's over, now let me show you
Exactly how the breaking point sounds

[Chorus] - 2X

[Chester Bennington: repeat 8X]
You did it to yourself

[Chorus]</pre>
