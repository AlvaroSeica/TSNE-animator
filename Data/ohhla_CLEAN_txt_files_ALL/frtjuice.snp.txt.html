Dis one yah name fruit juce! Numba one yuh know mi cyaan lose

Natural berries a so very great for di system
Some taught, some sweet, mi just cyaan resist dem

[Verse One: Snoop Lion]

Pineapple, mango, my taste buds tango
An ice cold beverage in my honey comb hideout
Chillin wid my beautiful empress we a standout

Natural berries a so very great for di system
Some taught, some sweet, mi just cyaan resist dem

[Verse Two: Snoop Lion]
She sip di beet juice seh she really love di medicine
Drink it down slow and feel di good vibes settle in
Di way di flavors goin down she ordered up anodda round
Tell mi dat she feel alright, natural juices over Sprite
Fi di guava juice she have a healthy appetite
Don't drink di Red Bull because she don't believe di hype
Fi di guava juice she have a healthy appetite
And don't drink di Red Bull because she don't believe di hype

[Chorus: Snoop Lion]
Fruit juce! Numba one yuh know mi cyaan lose
Inna my garden mi pick di fruit dat mi choose

[Verse Three: Mr. Vegas]
