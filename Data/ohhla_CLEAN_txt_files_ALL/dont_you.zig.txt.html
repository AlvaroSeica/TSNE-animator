Song:   Don't You Kill Love
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Don't you kill love don't you kill love don't you kill love

In the blink of an eye time passes us by
Where does it go
Now will you take a stand for love I am
Forever more
These wars have wounded my heart so my trust breaks apart
To human I say these words

Don't you kill love don't you kill love don't you kill love

This chance we should not miss to share this sacred bliss
And spread it all around I'm gonna spread it all around
My heart been broke before but still I must endure
Keep the spirits high keep the spirits high
Cause it's the greatest things in life calls for the most sacrifice
Are we brave are we brave enough

Don't you kill love don't you kill love don't you kill love</pre>
