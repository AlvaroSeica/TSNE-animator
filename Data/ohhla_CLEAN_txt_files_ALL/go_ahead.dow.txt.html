[Mr. Shadow]
Ha ha
Quivole
Mr. Shadow
Lil' Rob
Viscious Man Funk on the boards, comin' at you for the '98 
And it won't stop
Ha
Check it

[Verse 1: Mr. Shadow]
It is I, the unfadable lyricist, bringin' mad
Hits, for that ass, one way in the past
When I mash, let me hear you scream and holla when ya see me
Party people in the house, can you feel me?
It's Mr. Shadow and I'm known to explode
Like a box of C-4 when I bust at a show
I have shown, that I'm bound to break it down like a boulder
You wanna bring the drama, put the rifle to my shoulder
But I ain't trippin' cause I'm here to make you bounce
Countin' money by the stacks
Bustin' raps and buildin' clout
Now
All my dawgs, have 'em clips, in the gats
Ready for the confratation, never hesitate to cap
And you know it ain't, nothin' but a gangsta party
Drinkin' Don Perignone, dry gin and barcardi
In California, home of real pimps and players with the raw dough
Down to the bone, on the streets or on the microphones
Getting bit is a daily thing
Homeboys get down, girls yell my name
Hun
I be the Shadow that'll follow you regardless
Through the night, causin' fright, when you step into the light

Chorus:
[Mr. Shadow]   Mr. Shadow, Lil Rob and the Viscious Man Funk
               Comin' through with the funk, that you bump in your trunk
[Mayhem Click] Go ahead, go ahead
               Now make ya body move
               Go ahead, now make ya body move
[Mr. Shadow]   Ha ha
               Mr. Shadow, Lil Rob and the Viscious Man Funk
               Comin' through with the funk, that you bump in your trunk
[Mayhem Click] Go ahead, go ahead
               Now make ya body move
               Go ahead, now make ya body move

[Verse 2: Lil' Rob]
I grab my Levis and my ironin' board
Cuffs all messed up because the bag drags on the floor
But that's all good, got no one to impress
Because my fame will overcome those that
Are best dressed
Must confess, get this off my chest, I must have been blessed
I could see them just convinced, ready to go, so let's go
So I jumped
In the ride, headed for my destination
Tonight is gonna to be sick, but I don't need no medication
Ladies run with chase and never mind
Cause they ain't runnin
Cause we all came to the party for a little somethin' somethin'
Oh girls, you lookin' so naughty
I could see that one right there with someone like me
Should I take a chance and ask one to dance
Do I want the one
In the mini skirt
Or the tight pants
It doesn't matter cause they're beautiful
Can't help but
Lose my cool, can't help but drool, when they push and pull

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
[Mr. Shadow] You can push, you can pull, you can do what you want
             Mr. Shadow, Lil' Rob and The Viscious Man Funk
             Nothin', bump, out the stuff, that we blaze in the place
             But you can't drink for free
[Lil' Rob]   So you best bring a case
[Mr. Shadow] Hun
             That's on the realer
             As I begin to feel the affection
             I'm gettin' noted and I notice the one closest to me
             I keep it cool cause she's noticin' me
             And that's the only type of girl I see proposin' to me
             So I lean to the side and wink my eye to let her know
             Baby got it goin' on, so I can't let her go
             Lil' Rob, where'd you go, I was lookin' for your ass
[Lil' Rob]   I was downin' drinks like water, so I got drunk kind of fast
             I was on the other side just
             Doin' what I do
             Looking for a girl to talk to
             {*female coos*}
             Not you
             But I got my eyes on one, I want you to have my son
             And we can get this done if you want to have some fun
             But if
             You don't
             Want to
             It's ok
             I'll just go find another one
[Mr. Shadow] Huh huh
             Hey dawg, we're gone

Repeat Chorus</pre>
