Song:   Zero Tolerance
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Zero tolerence is somethin' that I call
When I don't give a shit about anything at all
And I don't take any crap from anybody else
So they can all just kiss my ass
And go to fuckin' hell
Two, three, four
When I am walking down the street
When somebody calls to me
Hey you little fucking faggot bastard ass pussy
My eyes turn red
My fists are clenched
And something snaps inside
I take a rock up to their heads and bash it open wide
Three four
Never stop the rhythm just to think about it twice
Cause I dont give a shit whats right or wrong or which ways nice
I don't take no shit from just anyone but me
And Im kinda vicious when the people mess with me
Two three four
When I am walking down the street
When someone calls to me
Hey you little fucking faggot bastard ass pussy
My eyes turn red
My fists are clenched
And something snaps inside
I take a rock up to his mother fucking head and I bash it open wide!
Three four
Zero tolerence is somethin' that I call
When I don't give a shit about anything at all
And I dont take any crap from anybody else
So they can all just kiss my ass and go to fuckin' hell</pre>
