[K-Rino]
I drive my load so wild, that it's hard to ride sober
When I wanna switch lanes, I make the road slide over
My styles are placed on a private base
Where each one of the phrases I create, need a thousand acres of closet space
To face K-Rino is hard luck
I spent a whole day connected to a Dodge truck, letting my body charge up
You can't avoid, the true test
I don't use earthly ammunition, you need a asteroid proof vest
I speak the language, of the insects
My hand's a twenty screen cineplex, with a live volcano's heat index
Me not the best, you shouldn't have said such
Surgical like head cuts, or the results of sling blade edge up's
For no reason, my cerebrum improves with the seasons
Upon release, my thoughts produce ectoplasm excretions
My anicdotes, recieve standing O's
And blow gashes the size of canteloupes, you'll need a car cover to bandage those
The more I study, my advantage grows
A true alien and it shows, dove from a cliff and landed in a manic's pose
My monograms have been known
Pretend clones I send home, and uppercut your chin bone until it's ingrown
I peeled until your skin's gone
On the field I let you score, because I planted land mines inside the end zone
You suffer plagues, and afflictions
I'm the clairvoyant, who predicted Nastradamus wouldn't make his predictions
I stood over the monuments
A dawn with celestial bodies that hung from my arms, like tree ornaments
This is the vengeance, predecadents
The restitution of replacance, with infinite spread measurements
The scholastic rap Chaplin
I clap until the whole world notices, the presence of your absence
The egg inside a vulture's nest, is where I go for rest
My flows ingest a Malcolm 8, with moldy flesh and coellest
I rocket through the cosmics, with aeronautics
You a product of volick, and a builder of anthropomorphic objects
I got a mind, that far dated Einstein
Reincarnated nine times, with raw jaded lines cause I'm
The electric wire light propier tour, of the fire core
Koleidoscope big hybrid with the jaw, of a dinosaur
Vice grip a windpipe with a right claw, when I'm fighting war
Got the power to switch tomorrow night, with the night before
I'ma combine Raddimus, and Optimus Prime
I was designed to carry eight mics at a time, and drop a octopus rhyme
One day I'll end my recitals, and pass down the title
But for actions of my desciples, I won't be held liable
No man can put an end, to this ministry
Aided by chemistry, and the seven sinners of spiritual energy
The pseudo intellect, speaks cinically
Till they see me visually paint word portraits, with A symetrical symmetry
When some insist to be contradictory, but I'm beyond what's done traditionally
What's hard for some, is done by me simplistically
But as I say, on this beat today you'll hear no more from K
So now I lay in deep silence, and listen to this organ play</pre>
