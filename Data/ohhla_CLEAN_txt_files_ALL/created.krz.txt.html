Song:   Created a Monster
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Are you surprised to see me?
Yea, you left me for dead
But I made it instead
You thought that I'd never make it
Feelin like the world stripped me naked
Not who I used to be
Now they scream for me
And you created a monster

Who am I to you? (nobody)
Who are you to me? (nobody)
Life ain't so long
Guess I made this song for you
You did it, you did it
You created a monster
Oh-oh you created a monster
Oh-oh you created a monster
Oh-oh such a beautiful monster

Guess I get picked last in gym class again
Pick on the fat kid, we can kick ass on him
And he funny lookin' and he can't even afford lunch
Let's give him a bunch of punches in his stomach maybe
Roughin him up and makin him cry
Cause he got vitiligo on his mouth and on his eyes
And he'll never fight back, he ain't built like that
He's a scaredy cat, afraid he might get killed like that
Mama's boy, turned him into ominous
It's probly just a matter of time before he come to school like it's columbine
Minus the trench coats, slit throat, them folk
Put 'em in a choke hold, never let 'em grow old
Mama told me make it into a gimmick
And my F.A. told me it's a reason God made you this way
What the world did to me is comin' right back at ya
I'm glad, I had to be a monster
Monster
Oh-oh Oh-oh
Oh-oh such a beautiful monster

Who am I to you? (nobody)
Who are you to me? (nobody)
Like things too long
Guess I made this song for you
You did it for you
You created a monster
Oh-oh you created a monster
Oh-oh you created a monster
Oh-oh such a beautiful monster</pre>
