[Intro/Chorus: KRS-One]
However, I'm really fascinating to the letter
My english grammar gets better and better
However, I'm really fascinating to the letter
My english grammar gets better and better
However, I'm really fascinating to the letter
My english grammar gets better and better
However, I'm really fascinating to the letter
My english grammar gets better

[KRS-One]
History in the making, get with me I'm not faking
Big up all my Jamaicans, Haitians and all my nations
Latinos and my Asians, yeah I know you've been waitin
Feeling you've been forsaken, but I'm building this nation
Building new innovation, look at what we've been facin
Payola on these stations, plus they run like plantations
Complete with black beats sportin soul by caucausians
If you hear me on your station best believe I'm not payin~!
KRS is the realest, KRS-One is fearless
I grew up in them days when crack was new to drug dealers
See them cats they be liars, we the New York survivors
Eighty-one to ninety-one, they was our record buyers
Now they front cause they got work tryin to redo all my work
'til we live and in concert, and I'm makin they eye hurt
Shinin so bright and so lively
Everybody know, hip-hop was better in the nineties

[Chorus]

[Pee-Doe]
{?} it was better in the nineties, the solo was grimey
The Wu-Tang Clan came in with the killer army
Grand Puba came in with Girbauds hangin low
Hilfiger Tommy niggaz rockin Polo
40 ounce guzzlin, nickel bag coppin
Troopin through the block with the boombox knockin
All we do is "Spark Mad Ism" non-stop and
when Hot 97 played the real hip-hop and
I remember 98, point 7 KISS FM
with Kool DJ Red Alert, mixin up the blends
Them mixtape deejays had the streets on lock
Like Demo and Ron G, my nigga Doo Wop
Before the radio station corrupted the nation
to rule the street, A&amp;R's discoverin the sensations
KRS came with the peace declaration
Took it with the leaders to the United Nations
