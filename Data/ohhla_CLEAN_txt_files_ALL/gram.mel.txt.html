[Hodgy Beats]
I bet you never heard some shit like this before
MellowHype, "BlackenedWhite" is too original
Give me the snares, give me the drum, had it rotated with the hi-hat
Let the music paint my destiny so I don't buy maps
Toastin champagne, flukes and wine caps
Purple kush got me sleepy, I'm fin' to take a nice nap
Baby compare your man to me, uh, I'm twice that
He keep you up all night, I put to sleep night cap
I'm killin you niggaz and that's a bright fact
If Christ gave me the gift of a talent well then can Christ rap?
Swastika letterman jacket nigga you like that?
Lookin for cheerleading booties and booties I might sack
Lineback, Hodgy Beats, I'm back
MellowHype we're in... with master generics
Kill Them All, smear it all in your mirrors

[Outro]
MellowHype is too epic
You better fuck with Odd Future
If you don't fuck with Odd Future...
Fuck you!</pre>
