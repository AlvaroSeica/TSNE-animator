[Fingazz]
I know, I know
She's so, she's so
She got me so confused
I don't know what to do

[Mr. Lil' One]
I know, I know
She's so, she's so
Can't find the words to say it
Uh, uh, uh

[Mr. Lil' One]
(Verse 1)
Yeah, it feel so good, but it seems so hard
So much love, that it break my heart
Amazin', crazy, y'all and what
Feel I gotta go, but it's so much fun (Fun...)
Stay around here, don't let me go
Is it over now, I don't wanna know
I get a flash of the past when we fell in love
Where did we go wrong, where did we get stuck
Candle light dinners
Walks on the beach
My daughter once told me, "Papa Don't Preach"
How you'd end up over there
Like you don't care
Everything's Yeah Yeah Yeah

Chorus: Fingazz
She's so
She's so
She's so
That words just can't describe
And I want her (So)
Yeah, I need her (So)
Got me so, so, that
I just can't decide

Pre-Verse: Mr. Lil' One (Fingazz)
I don't want it (No)
Yes, I do (Whoa, oh)
I'm so lost and confused, I-I-I
Don't know what to do

(Verse 2)
Yeah, it seems so hard, but I'm still right here
Been around the whole world, twice this year
Screaming, yellin'
So intense
So much love, shit, it don't make sense (Sense...)
I don't wanna go, let's take it slow
Baby, come close, let me touch you so
Shit, there's nobody else like you for me
Everytime you speak, it's like poetry
Somebody, somewhere, teaching me right
When I'm weak and alone, get me through the night
Get past the pain and all the hurt we feel
And all my life, it's never been so real

Repeat Chorus

Repeat Pre-Verse

[Mr. Lil' One]
I know, I know
She's so, she's so
Can't find the words to say it
But you know what I'm sayin'

[Fingazz]
I know, I know
She's so, she's so
She got me so confused
I don't know what to do

[Mr. Lil' One {Mr. Lil' One *slowed down*}]
I don't wanna go, let's take it slow
Baby, come close, let me touch you so
{So
So sublime
I think I lost my mind}

Repeat Chorus

Repeat Pre-Verse</pre>
