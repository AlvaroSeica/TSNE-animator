Masta Ace:

A son, how you B? 
"Aiyo I'm chillin"
and I C you D to go out, and make a killin', but where E?
"F that nigga he making G's on tour with H-Town doing shows overseas"
yeah I heard he DJ'd but stop hatin' OK? (I ain't hatin')
Smoke your L and chill the fuck out, I found a way to get paid
you know how I M, we gonna be N
cuz my cousin Tyriq said, to meet him about ten
"Now that's that shit that I'm talking about
so yo let me just take this leak and then we out"
O now you gotta P, well hurry up it's quarter to
and I just got this beep from son, and that's the Q
R you ready? Hurry, I'll be in the S-10, Blazer
out front, he blowing up my pager
"Aiyo I hope this nigga's about getting cash
cuz mom's is about to evict my broke ass"
Chill, my cousin's like the 2001 Mr. T
rock mad ice and platinum, watch you gonna see
He pushin a 600, with color TV in the visor
and got more gadgets, than McGuiver (ooh)
we gonna make dough on the W ain't seen
in your lifetime or my lifetime yo mad cream
oh shit, you seen that car that drove by? (yeah)
well that was his X-hoe Lisa, and that was Y
he told us to drive through the hood and if we caught her
take back that 300-Z that he just bought her...so what's up
"Nigga I don't give a fuck, whatever we gotta do
we can take the bitch car, the money and jewels too
make this u-turn, we'll catch her at the light
and get right, off of this quick jooks tonight
I don't give a fuck"</pre>
