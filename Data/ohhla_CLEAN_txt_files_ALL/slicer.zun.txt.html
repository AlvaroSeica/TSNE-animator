[Intro: Dana (K-Blunt) {Buddha Monk}]
Oooh oooh (what what what what what?)

[K-Blunt]
Question, answer, who's the believer?
True believers break us down and deceive us
Images reflect like foil, mad turmoil
Causin' brain tissue to uncoil
Cultural like irrigation
Control the population with female genital pre-relations
Defy the laws of gravity
Scientifical scientists can't comprehend us, a catastrophy
Tossin' hooks from trees, separated at the knees
Intense pain, you can't SCREAM
Wish you could, ya petrified like wood
Now I chop ya head 'til ya ass is good
Remember this, I feed like photosynthesis
Remember this, ways, a sharp tight disc gets thrown
Slice so deep, in to the bone, burnin' Blunt with rabies
I fall on this microphone
You couldn't see the force for the trees, yet you believe
As you descend, beneath (nigga dyin' nigga what?) Ha ha.. bring it back

[5 Foot Hyper Sniper]
Niggaz get scalped, fuckin' with this Amityville Horror house
Knifes in the pillows of their couch
Go through ya ass, boss, make a route
Come out ya naval, disconnectin' ya tables, to the swords
Sword choppin' ya, breathe the force!
Wrap you like syran wrap, shouldn't have worn that
Like Kojak, told you on Zu tracks 'bout my axe
Fiends for blood, caught them in my den
I let my Ninjaz begin slicin' ya skin
(Ouch hits the blades, comin' in slicin' on limbs!)
Slashin' 'em, gashin' 'em
The dumb, deaf and blind, refined, the 85 mind
Get 'em off the swine, slice his spin
Get him open, in every direction, fire off intersections
Leave 'em, never, open operate, new Blunt, cut him new wounds
Can't escape, the tales, from the Ninjaz tombs

[Interlude: Buddha Monk]
Ninja habitat, your mission is not complete, protect please

[D.L.]
Never mind that, yo, where ya mind at?
It's in the gutter, motherfucker
Leave you on cloud nine, I'm packin' mine
Fully refined, re-designed for ninety-nine
Refrained from swine, cheap wine, dirty behind
You can't come near me, you wanna kill me cuz you fear me
You spineless, I rip ya back out, sucker you hear me?
The total rap package, automatic street sweepin'
Lyrical manifester sent here to bless ya
I'm a messenger deliverin' unabombs
My arsenal is limitless
Check my file, shit hits, you make licks, mimick this
You can't do this shit, it's home son
You couldn't swing it cuz all you hit was home runs
You out the ballpark, not even close to my rawness
I knock out artists, annihilatin' any target
Don't start it (Hhahhaa) Nigga

[Babyface Fensta]
Pirate, nitwit, esophagus
Spit rancid acid at ya head like the horn of a rhinocerous
Preposterous statements'll go through, few and dangerous
Circumstances like startin' beef you wasn't ready for
Was takin' too many chances
Daredevil, ya rebel in splender
My agenda, descend the Earth nation, contend with despicable heathens
Leave bodies floatin' like casualties from navy battleships
Twist like fronto and I know that nigga and his bitch
Reality, six in ya midst, dimension descension
Duct tapin', interrogatin', Gillettes, electric shocks, wet
Russian roulette with society misfits
Bleedin' and crippled, neutral nemesis, subsequent offenses
Death penalty, ya whole family, tragedy
Gibberish, rhettoric, condemned

[Hook: Dana - repeat to fade]
Niggaz if ya wanna make noise get ready.. (slicer slicer)

[Outro: Buddha Monk]
The Zu's callin'... terrorists...</pre>
