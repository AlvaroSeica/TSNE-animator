[Intro]
Oren, what's up dog? Ready to rock? Rise, yo. Yo, hold on a second
Yo I'll be right back. Naw, (In my word). Hold on
Yo son, another voice just popped up in my headphones
Singin'. No, that's not my voice, that's totally different voice
You didn't hear it? Right there. (I see you sometimes)
Alright, check the board and see if any of the tracks are lightin'
Or anything else is goin'. Just stop for a second
Check the board to see if anything else is playing
Right there. Y'all don't hear that? Don't hear that?

[Verse One]
It's like I rhymed and I rhymed and I rhymed and I zoned
Then I rhymed then my mind has a mind of it's own
And all these moments in a thought pattern and signals I send
The rhymes revised three times before it gets to the pen
Freestyle
Memories bad, I remember I'm dope
Names are dumb, we're all one, I remember you yo
But
Thoughts in my dome strong, prone to defeat
Not a single day alone, I build Rome in a week
In my head
Sometimes I grow two ears, know who's a grandma to me
No needs to talk to 
Cause now, who's gonna answerin'?
I'm wrapped in my brains that happened like right on first
Cause art from life bites, vice verse in my life's work
No rest
Compose for the spirits and bodies who feel it
But this, songs in my head so I don't know if y'all hear it
But, when it plays it holds you
I create each phrase to go to
My delivery is postal
Hope you think I crazy don't you?

[Verse Two]
Check
You said everywhere there's lessons you can figure out how
Sorry I asked myself some questions and I answer them loud
I'm buggin' out
So I'm walkin' outside in a bop
Entirely too hard to a song I ain't even got
The radio ain't playin'
And the people, look how they ask
They think I'm about to wild out while of this of this rap
I would clap to this beat in my head if y'all heard it
Said, "Oh, I got the flow down, I just got to word it"
I'm gone
I'm in my mind's mansion
I don't know how it happened
The last thing that I saw...a bunch of clowns dancin'
? everything's material
And everything that happened now
Happened a few years ago
Appears as though a genius
I make sense of my trouble
Or am I just a drunk Dumbo seein' elephants bubble?
But they don't rise in the streets
Wanna rise to the truth
So I'm in the booth
With beats that cause a rise to the roof</pre>
