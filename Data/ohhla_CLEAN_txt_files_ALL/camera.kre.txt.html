Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I got your girl on film and she wanna make a movie
She can be the star, and I can be her groupie
Or the director, let me show you how my camera works
I got you in my frame, let me see your camera work
Girls on film and they wanna make a movie
She can be the star, and I can be her groupie
Or the director, let me show you how my camera works
I got you in my frame, let me see your camera work
Tell james cameron to put me on the silver screen
I'm avatar blue and need a pocket full of green
As a teen I would capture with a fish eye
On the block gassin where them bitches cook their fish fry
I'm flyer than the grease up off your skillet, so hand me any camera and garunteed I kill it
I film it and the feel it, because they got no other choice
I auto focus in, I see her gettin moist
No voice, I am rollin in that wide benz
I'm only fuckin witchu if you got a wide lense
Bitch your fine, you can bring 5 friends
Or 95 blunts, a hundred racks a month
Places everybody, quiet on the set
I need you on your mark honey, and yes your gettin wet
My leading lady, you know you lookin extra hot
Take one roll, film for the money shot
I got your girl on film and she wanna make a movie
She can be the star, and I can be her groupie
Or the director, let me show you how my camera works
I got you in my frame, let me see your camera work
Girls on film and they wanna make a movie
She can be the star, and I can be her groupie
Or the director, let me show you how my camera works
I got you in my frame, let me see your camera work
U know my vision blows, I'm so original
I'm in the base, smoke a good count and residuals
I'm shootin HD baby I'm high def
I'm on the turf hard, I'm talkin crime, theft, burglary and arson
I doccument them all, I'm quentin tarrintino reservoir dogs raw
And the hood say I deserve an oscar, director of the year kreayshawns a little monster
I kill em all at sundance, I kill em all at cantz
I sweep the golden globes and I blow a couple grams
In the face of amny man who ever try and doubt me
2 thumbs up, my films are so astounding
So holler at me if you lookin for a classic
Or holler at me if you need some pills, weed or that acid
I got it on the low and I'm sure u'll be runnin back
End scene over your blunt, thats a wrap
I got your girl on film and she wanna make a movie
She can be the star, and I can be her groupie
Or the director, let me show you how my camera works
I got you in my frame, let me see your camera work
Girls on film and they wanna make a movie
She can be the star, and I can be her groupie
Or the director, let me show you how my camera works
I got you in my frame, let me see your camera work</pre>
