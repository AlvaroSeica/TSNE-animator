[Intro: Bumpy Knuckles]
AHHHH! Y'all niggas love Bumpy Knuckles on this Premo shit
Word up Kolexxxion, this a banger this is big this hop hop gotta be this
We gotta play this shit here, in a big stadium, this is stadium music right here
Hip hop let's take it back to the stadium, salute to hip hop
Everybody in hip hop throw your hands up right now
We gettin ready to get this motherfucker poppin
Bumpy Knuckles let's go!

[Verse One: Bumpy Knuckles]
I call this the stadium shaker, right hand comin from the ear
CRACK! Cranium braker
I don't give a fuck about the stories that make ya
I'll pop you and be out before the law could take ya
In the game I'm an O.G. nigga face it
When I'm in the room y'all faces get basic
Nigga tote his mask see that nigga Bumpy Knuckles
He 'gon stay with two blinkies, right through his sixties
Hard! Stance! Tight in hands!
Bumpy throwin Knuckles with lightnin hands
These beats bang hard like pots and pans
Call Premo, you get Freddie Foxx in hands 
Come on!

[Chorus: Flavor Flav] (Bunmpy Knuckles)
YEEEAHHHHH BOY! This shit is hot! (Shake the room!)
Hip Hop is terrorizin the spot! (Shake the room!)
New York City blocks on the rocks! (Shake the room!)
We got a club banger get off the jock! (That's right!)

[Verse Two: Bumpy Knuckles]
When a DJ wanna show you he nice he spittin wax
When rhymin is a part of your life he spittin facts
When MC's step on stage, with a nigga
Who don't give a fuck who you know, they fall back
Talkin to a bonafide pimp, with the forty five on a tight limp 
I dare you to say sum'n
Standin on the side of the stage couple of goons
Mic check! Premier play sum'n (Play it!)
You ain't big enough for me to get a rep on like twenty five pounds
I put it down, hit the bench
Three hundred on the rack, two deep breaths
And I throw that shit back! Like a shot of yack! Word up!

[Chorus: Flavor Flav] (Bumpy Knuckles)
Come on y'all let's go! (Shake the room!)
We gettin it in baby! YO! (Shake the room!)
Freddie Foxx on the motherfuckin flow! (Shake the room!)
What the fuck do you motherfuckers know?! HUH!

[Verse Three: Bumpy Knuckles]
When the MC's fall off the pain is felt
From the bottom of the deck, the game is dealt
These punk ass niggas with their blow job deals
I miss Guru, fuck how Solaar feels!
I'll step to you, show you how the crowbar feels
Put knots you, speed like, over this hot shit
You always wanted, to be like, boy, here's a green light
Come on! Hands in the air I'm the king of this here
Even though it ain't fair there would never be a heir
Hands in the air ladies titties out (Titties out baby!)
Now we stompin your city out! COME ON SHAKE!

[Chorus: Flavor Fav] (Bumpy Knuckles)
This shit is straight up crack! (Yeah! Shake the room!)
A world premiere a break your back! (HARDER!)
We got a club banger homey word up! (Shake the room!)
Got somethin to say shut the fuck up! (COME ON!)

[Verse Four: Bumpy Knuckles]
Bumpy on the block I got a banger from Vern
Boom bap underground when will you learn
Bumpy Knuckles, Premo, we makin moves 
Collection, bangers, shakin rooms
COME ON SHAKE!

[Chorus: Flavor Flav] (Bunmpy Knuckles)
YEEEAHHHHH BOY! This shit is hot! (Shake the room!)
Hip Hop is terrorizin the spot! (YEAH!)
New York City blocks on the rocks! (Shake the room!)
We got a club banger get off the jock! (Word!)

[Verse Five: Bumpy Knuckles]
The boom! Hip Hop spit by goons
And I'm better than I was yesterday, afternoon
Alot of y'all niggas is rhymin wounds
And how we get 'em out, is shake the room
COME ON SHAKE!

[Chorus: Flavor Flav] (Bumpy Knuckles)
Come on y'all let's go! (Shake the room!)
We gettin it in baby! YO! (Shake the room!)
