[J. Cole]
Yeah... hey
Spinnin in circles, live my life without rehearsal
If I die today my nigga was it business? Was it personal?
Should this be my last breath? I'm blessed cause it was purposeful
Never got to church to worship Lord but please be merciful
You made me versatile, well-rounded like cursive
Know you chose me for a purpose, I put my soul in these verses
+Born Sinner+, was never born to be perfect
Sucka for women lickin they lips and holdin these purses
Back when we ran the streets, who would think we'd grow to be murderers?
Teachers treated niggaz as if they totally worthless
And violent, and hopeless, I saw but never noticed
that a college point is right to "Be All That You Can Be" posters
Rest in peace to Tiffany, I don't know if
this the realest shit I wrote but know the realest nigga wrote this
And signed it, and sealed it in a envelope and knew one day you'll find it
And knew one day you'll come back and rewind it
Singin

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
I'm a born sinner
But I'll die better than that, swear
You were always where I needed you to be
whether you were there or not there (I was there)
I was born sinnin
But I'll live better than that (better than that)
If you ain't fuckin with that
I don't care (ooooh-ooooh-ooooh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[J. Cole]
Yeah, this music shit is a gift
But God help us make it cause this music biz is a cliff
I got her life in my grip, she holdin tight to my wrist
She's screamin "Don't let me slip"
She see the tears in my eyes, I see the fear on her lips
True when I told you, "You the only reason why I don't flip, and go insane"
My roof in the pourin rain
You knew me before the fame, don't lose me the more I change
No, just grow with me; go broke, you go broke with me
I smoke you gon' smoke with me
Woman's curse since birth, man lead her to the hearse, I go Bobby you go Whitney
Damn, listen here; I'll tell you my biggest fears
You the only one who knows 'em - don't you ever go expose 'em
This life is harder than you'll probably ever know
Emotions I hardly ever show
More for you than for me, don't you worry yourself, I gotta do this for me
They tell me life is a test, but where's the tutor for me?
Pops came late, I'm already stuck in my ways
Duckin calls from my mother for days
Sometimes she hate the way she raised me but she love what she raised
Can't wait to hand her these house keys with nothin to say
Except

[Chorus]

[Chorus] - sung by a choir
