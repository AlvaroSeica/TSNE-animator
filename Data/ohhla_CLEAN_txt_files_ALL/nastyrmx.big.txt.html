Intro:  BIG (Puffy)
(Uh-uh, yea)

(I think I want a remix again)
This goes out to my Brooklyn crew (ready Big)
Represtin all the freaky bitches
Fuck 'em all day and fuck 'em all night
We don't love these hoes
(I want a remix again, I think I want a remix again)
(Bad Boy, 98)
You heard me
(B.I.G. the greatest, come on)

Verse One: BIG (Puffy)

Uhh, I go, on and on and on and
Don't take her to the crib and let your bone in uh
Easy, call em on the phone and
Platinum Chanel cologne and
I stay, dressed, to impress
Spark these bitches interest
Sex is all I expect
If they watch TV in the Lex, they know (they know)
They know, quarter past four
Left the club tipsy, say no mo' (say no mo)
Except how I'm gettin home, tomorrow (tomorrow)
Caesar drop you off when he see his P.O., uh
Back of my mind I hope she swallow (uh-huh)
Man She split a drink on my cream Wallows
Reach the gate, hungry just ate
Riffin, she got to be to work by eight
This must mean she ain't tryin to wait
Conversate, sex on the first date I state
"You know what you do to me"
She starts, "Well but I don't usually"
Then I, whipped it out, rubber no doubt (ow)
Step out, show me what you all about (yea)
Fingers in your mouth, open up your blouse
Pull your G-string down South, aoowww (aoowww)
Threw that back out, in the parking lot
By a Cherokee and a green drop-top
And I don't stop, until I squirt
Jeans skirt butt-naked it all work

Chorus: (Puffy)

Nasty (Envision dreams of passion)
Going through my mind (And all the while I think of you)
Nasty (A sexual reaction)
Makes me wanna ride (You nasty girl, you nasty)

Verse Two: BIG

I remember we, went to Tennessee (uh-huh)
Then we came home, mad messages was on my phone
Bitch named Symone
Screamin, she feenin for the semen
Me being the man that I am
Took it to her condo, pronto (uh-huh)
Half Indian, I called her Tonto
Roll the kronk ton in the dark pronto (eh-eh)
Few puffs, I got low
And off to the bedroom we go *hmm*
Sex is drama, head to trauma
Rip pajamas I'mma stay to tomorrow
Satisfying all my needs twice
With some whipped cream, handcuffs and ice
The bitch is nice, word is bond
Can't wait to put my niggaz on, what, what?

Chorus: (Puffy)

Nasty (Envision dreams of passion)
Going through my mind (And all the while I think of you)
Nasty (A sexual reaction)
Makes me wanna ride (You nasty girl, you nasty uh)

Verse Three: BIG (Puffy)

Ladies, my Mercedes
Hold four in the back (this is the remix), two if you fat
Keep a gat, cause cats (This, Is, the Remix), try to test me
They just fans like (Biatch) DeNiro, Wesley
Let's see the bitch I'm waiting on
Godier jeans look like they painted on
Ask thee, leave it up to me
Lay her on back ever so gently (yea)
She like the way the dope fold up, Rolls roll up
Cristal till she throw up, bitch grow up
Hold up, there's De Genera
Dripped out, iceberg Capero
Intro goes without speaking
Call me Cease cause I keep em, we can go freakin
All weekend, so, roll in
Ain't it good that my Lex keeps folding?  Uhh
(Oww!)

Chorus: (Puffy)
