(David Banner)
See what's crazy to me, is we done subliminally became-
What they THINK we are ANYWAY! {*Lil Wayne - Syrup Sipping beat queues*}
It's like we just some ol' country ass dumb niggas!
And we not that! We so much fuckin more than that, dude
And my mama told me something, she said-
You being a visionary, is your curse as well as your blessing
She said you gon' be blessed with visions
that REGULAR niggas ain't gon be able to see...
So that's what MAKE you be alone</pre>
