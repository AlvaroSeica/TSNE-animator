I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care

[ESHAM]
One day Ima learn hoe ass niggaz ain't worth my while
Funny style actin, dirty maccin, playa hatin, contemplatin, fuckin my thoughts up
I get caught up in this bullshit, the way bitches bullshit
Niggaz be jealous, sometimes even my fellas
Things change, niggaz rearrange whether ya tell us
Life is bullshit, and I know that this is true
Sometimes I feel depressed, what can a nigga do?
Aint no way out, only way out is the route of a slug point blank at my mug
Sometimes I just wanna scream at the world, I'm mad
Other times I feel happy just to be sad
I don't really got much more to say
cus people die everyday, and we gonna all die anyway
Its kinda hard, but who said life was fair
And from the funky stains in my underwear
I don't care

[MASTAMIND]
No I don't care no more
No I don't care if niggaz stare at me
Look at my face, I ain't happy
Bitch what you wanna come at me with?
Not that same shit, see I'm shameless
And I hang with that mentally derranged click
Stay up off it, you cant change this
Cant teach a wicked witch new tricks
Hell's the fire on the candle sticks
Stay off these bloody streets
for you ain't gonna see no peace
I just don't give a fuck cus nobody gives a fuck about me
So we be like fuck 'em, mother fuck 'em, can't trust 'em
I'd rather .45 slug 'em before the grave diggers dug 'em
I'm ready when you not
my mind's twisted in a knot
Can't let jealous niggaz see me cause they'll kill me on the spot
Truth or dare, my gun gonna shoot up in the air
Pieces of my mind over there, and there
But I don't care

[ESHAM]
How can I care about somethin when I don't give a fuck about nothing.  You
dont care about me, you don't love me, and I don't love me.  So fuck you, and
fuck you, fuck he, fuck she and fuck your G-O-D nigga.  You know what I'm sayin?
