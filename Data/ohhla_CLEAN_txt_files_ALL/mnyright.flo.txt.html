Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I got my money right, I ain't nothin nice
its goin down tonight, thats what the bitches like all day long

I got my money right, I ain't nothin nice
its goin down tonight, thats what the bitches like all day long
I ain't hurry for nothin baby (all day long)
I ain't hurry for nothin now hold it down

I got my money right, I ain't nothin nice
its goin down tonight, thats what the bitches like all day long
I ain't hurry for nothin baby (all day long)
I ain't hurry for nothin now hold it down (all day long)

Everythin safe, got a walk-in safe
Treadmill rappers still runnin in place
All these meals I can share my plate
Flo Rida full yeah I already ate

Plenty to give or take Im bout business
Make no mistake baby serious this real estate
froms a million inches away my postition
I'm cuttin cake I'm the chef in the kitchen late
from my recipe bill its on the essence of haulin weight

Don't worry bout a dolla don dolla with the prada
ain't no problem if you swalla you a scarlet you get holla grand
pieces I got em I get em ballin like sucka
consider the show stoppa Im holdin it down propa

I got my money right, I ain't nothin nice
its goin down tonight, thats what the bitches like all day long
I ain't hurry for nothin baby (all day long)
I ain't hurry for nothin now hold it down

I got my money right, I ain't nothin nice
its goin down tonight, thats what the bitches like all day long
I ain't hurry for nothin baby (all day long)
I ain't hurry for nothin now hold it down (all day long)

My life is straight Im livin good I ain't hurtin for nothin
I'm not the riches in the word but I'm workin with somethin
The escalade all pearl, you control it with buttons
They keep the tabs on they curb when I come through stuntin
Thats Brisc best to believe it seatin on skates
I'm the don take it or leave it, throw it in ya face
Big B's makin it rain no need to hate
Got beef, loadin them thangs, grip the whole case
I got my money right and Im livin up some rubba bands
Hit the club heavy with, bet I spend a couple grand (couple grand)
On pictures, shove the keys on the hand
When Im on the scene know that Brisc be a wanted man

I got my money right, I ain't nothin nice
its goin down tonight, thats what the bitches like all day long
I ain't hurry for nothin baby (all day long)
I ain't hurry for nothin now hold it down

I got my money right, I ain't nothin nice
its goin down tonight, thats what the bitches like all day long
I ain't hurry for nothin baby (all day long)
I ain't hurry for nothin now hold it down (all day long)

Itch in my jeans I'm gettin braid everyday

I ain't hurry for nothin now hold it down (all day long)</pre>
