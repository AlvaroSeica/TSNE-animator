[Rock]
I ain't blackin' out yet, man. Yo fuck with dat.
Just spark...just spark all the rest of them L's, son so we can all just BLACK 
OUT!

[BJ Swan]
I get the best of the best T-H-C, C-O-U-N-T
whether from Jamaica or Hawaii, I stay comin up with that Jumanji
C'mon I thought you knew bout a brother like me
with a name like Swan...

[Rock]
You's a buddha junkie!

[BJ Swan]
chase the taste of the elegance flowin' in the bass
when we in the place, party people know they gotta wait
cause when Boot Camp niggas in the place to be
our only mission is to make you Black O-U-T, C'mon

[Rock]
C'mon, Poster Poster on the wall, who get's the blackest of them all?
Mr. MALDU! smokin lah till I Black Out
sometimes it make a nigga rhyme till I Black Out
now the'll be plenty ways to Black Out
one way is gettin mashed out, or bringin yo ass out the Bummy Jab house
and break yo mask out cause the smoke'll make you gag
spliff after spliff till you flat on yo ass

(chorus x 2)

I'm fallin'
I'm fallin'
I'm fallin'

Black Out's callin'

[Starang]
In the Double D, thinkin bout all the shit that worry me
me and Ville Sluggah had the all black bubbly
North Face Goose, cuttin' loose sticks and seeds out the weed
remember that shit?

[Louieville Sluggah]
True indeed...

[Starang]
Yo, when I wake up, I take a hit of the spliff
word up a lot of muthafuckas start they day like this

[Louieville Sluggah]
but they'll be no more smoke for me
pull up the Henny, so I can feel my bod drizzy
and max with my staff maintain and keep it nature
no chaser, straight up cause this shit is major
gotta page goin' off in range
sayin' bring my fuckin' whip back around the way

[Starang]
OK, now we out on the FDR
we both stoned out our minds, we probably won't get far

(chorus x 2)

I'm fallin'
I'm fallin'
I'm fallin'

Black Out's callin me

[Supreme]
As I choke from the smoke, throat hot like a kitchen
eyes heavy from the rezi when the room kept spinnin'
in an instant, I could of swore I saw the Reaper
THE REZI MONSTER, stuttered and uttered "nice to meet ya"
grabbed me in the sleeper, he said "smoke on this"
he said "nigga, I got some shit for yo rezi spliff"
that's when he pulled the hash out, I maxed out ready to pass out
living evidence the rezi spliff make yaaa...

[Steele]
a sin like entities on an astroplane
crack the Bible, hit the chalice to uplift my brain
no strain, meditation helps me to maintain
(singing)"me only smokin' sensi, me no sniff cocaine"
so do what you do to remain, till we return a-gain
back on to blackness from which we came

[Illa Noyz]
my day starts with a yawn in the early morn, what
off to the weed spot to ease tension off my knot
twist up the choc-o-lot, and the Fronto to make the brainz blo
that's alright, 24-7 that's how we flow, just lettin' you know
even in blackness we activists, act as if yo ass won't get dissed
get busy like drizzy, act like drazy leave you Swayze
even in my state of blackness, I'll attack the wackest
nigga with fanatics or dramatics, you're done in
come with the shit, I bring the havoc

(chorus x 4)

I'm fallin'
I'm fallin'
I'm fallin'

Black Out's callin me

[BJ Swan]
