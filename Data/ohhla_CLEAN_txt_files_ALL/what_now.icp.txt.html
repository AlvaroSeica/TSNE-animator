I remember beatin down the block
was the thing to do in my fisherman hat with the kangaroo

everybody rap, though they hood was compton
and the wolves yelled (oww) with 6 x 9's rockin

I remember the doors, I remember live aid
and I remember every year jerry lewis god paid

I remember shit live back when nobody missed it
like mike first doin the moonwalk and spinnin

I remember the hippies smokin grass and fuckin
disco dancin floor light I'm cuttin

I remember beatlemania seepin the planet
all that screamin from hoes, I couldn't stand it

I remember bruce lee, PS3 to pong
spandex, hair metal, rock love song

but everything's came and gone somehow
I only ask you, what the fuck is happenin now?

[Chorus 2X]
nothin, let me know
sure feel like nothin, let me know what
might be somethin there (what's good)
I'm feelin nothin, let me know what's good

I remember when the twist was the thing to do
slap grease on your head and hoes hang with you

I remember punk rock when it wasn't for sale
and death metal scarin people straight to hell

so many different cliques and crews to belong to
all identified by the music they drawn to

check the status of your apparatus and then go
nowaday, it ain't that clear though

I remember when jazz was born in new orleans
mom-and-pop record stores, i'd explore these

I remember when you handed in a newer 8-track
you got three old ones back, dope

I was at the first woodstock, backstage
I smoked a joint and dropped acid with jimmie page

I can't believe it's all over somehow
I only ask you, what the fuck is happenin now?

[Chorus 2X]
nothin, let me know
sure feel like nothin, let me know what
might be somethin there (what's good)
I'm feelin nothin, let me know what's good

I remember led zeppelin laid strairway to heaven
I delivered a pizza to they atudio session

I was there when beethoven went deaf and blind
he just kept playin like he ain't even mind it

I sold pills to elvis, he let me backstage
I stole his guitar, later sold it on ebay

I cannot believe it's all over somehow
I only ask you, what the fuck is happenin now?

[Chorus 2X]
nothin, let me know
sure feel like nothin, let me know what
might be somethin there (what's good)
I'm feelin nothin, let me know what's good

I only ask you, what the fuck is happenin now?</pre>
