Got me feeling the daily damage
Walk down streets paved with an-guish
Can't escape the easiest way to ban-dage
The universe expanded
abuse handed to brand
another mind with signs and the lan-guage
They know what pain is when it's plan-ted
Wandering around enchanted
by everything they tell you is romantic
You start to panic
cause you've taken it for granted
More than semantics
your opinions stay unfairly slan-ted
It's dangerous to risk
Use your religion as a trick
accept that you exist
Seek a fix a trip, slit wrists to slip
Further away from the grip
you thought you had on the myth
The sadness is sick tragic to be addic-ted to
It's fits you like those memories
you constantly sift through
Biological fathers dissapear and forget you
With a pistol to the head
thinking noone would miss you

Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge
holding tight to the light for dear life
Wondering if it's right to give up the fight instead
Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge
And sometimes the end feels better than this pretend
Happiness I defend that's hanging by a thread

All of the fear you're born in-to
alive within-you
Makes you question the existen-tial
So it's no wonder that your disease is men-tal
And the growth is exponen-tial
Feeling in place is essen-tial
But you've never felt safe
so you never learned the differen-tial
The voices detrimen-tal
The obsessions are instrumen-tal
in killing all of your poten-tial
That's why you hide when the rents-due
Cause it's a war upon your mind
and nothing ever defends-you
only offends-you
And in the darkness
the comfort of the thoughts
and words are what befriend-you
They got you doing everything you don't intend-to
Aiming directly at those who don't comprehend you
The same ones that always think
that they can always mend you
They never cared anyway they just pretend to

Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge
holding tight to the light for dear life
Wondering if it's right to give up the fight instead
Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge
And sometimes the end feels better than this pretend
Happiness I defend that's hanging by a thread

You took the stairs to the top
Now you stare overlooking the drop
it's their loss If you jump
Prepare yourself to be caught
By something you could never understand until you've felt it's hands clutch the outcome

You've thought it over and decided it's the best
you can make of the situation

Standing so close to the inevitable end
obsessed with desperation

Filled with despair
apologize for the lives you could never repair
Thank your parents and friends
that were never there
Thank everyone that called you important
but never cared

Wind on your skin, one with your sins
flying away
No regrets at all
Before the curtains close
dream of all the prose
you composed on your final day

Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge
holding tight to the light for dear life
Wondering if it's right to give up the fight instead
Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge
And sometimes the end feels better than this pretend
Happiness I defend that's hanging by a thread</pre>
