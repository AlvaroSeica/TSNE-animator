[Verse 1]
They say life's not worth living in Burn City
Work 40 hours a week until you turn 60
Earn fifty grand a year, debt for eternity
No sleep, no rest is a certainty
We choose to adhere, persuing careers
Like border men on parades, the brute with sincere
Losing our rights, using our fears
Burn City - one day I'll be moving from here
Going back to the cave, the embrionic stage
before the, black clouds and atomic rain
Before the, black wave on Boxing Day
Before the, man-made economic plague
Burn City lost her way, she's not the same
She forgot about the streets we populate
So we compensate in a lot of ways and intoxicate ourselves to stop the pain

[Chorus: Pegz and Kye] {Vocals in parentheses by Kye}
(Burn City)
What happened to the passion we had, I know you like the back of my hand
(Burn City)
I told you I'd be packing my bags if you ever turned your back on my fam
(Burn City)
That's the sound of an angry crowd singing
"BURN THIS BITCH TO THE GROUND!"
