Go Ro' Man Go Ro' Man Go Ro' Man
Go Romie Go Go Ro' Man Go Ro' Man

[Chorus]
Hey Ro' watch it flow. It's time for the Romeo Show
Holla Romeo's on now. Romeo's on now
Stop what ya doing 'cause Romeo's on now. [x2]

[Romeo]
I'm ready to rumble Miss it like gumbo
The Romeo Show competition I crumble
I mean I can't be stopped I will not quit
Cause me and the man make straight up hits
So iddy iddy oh Iddy iddy Ro'
It's time for the Romeo Show
Where kids have fun
Peer Pressure ain't nothing Real life outcome OK

[Chorus]

[Romeo]
Go Shortay It's your birthday
We gonna party like it's your birthday
Stopa says stop but Ro' Says go
I'm the first hip-hop kid with my own TV show woo
And people dancin' Shake it like that
You go to beauty school Work it like that
You love Romeo holla back
Cause Nickeloden's where I'm at OK
