(K-Rino talking) 
While y'all looking at the hourglass
Thinking that the sand is about to run out
I'm getting prepared to flip it over and keep gon', c'mon

[K-Rino]
I wish that life came with personal instruction pamphlets
References and answers for when it gets too rough to handle it
Despite slow advancement, I managed, y'all know who I stand wit'
He pulled me in when I was on the cusp of major damage
My life's a puzzle, I haven't matched up all the pieces yet
It seems like something's always missing I can never complete the set
I'm like a car with no wheels, my circumstances parked it
Plus I got a million dollar plan with no finance to spark it
We want our blessings overnight, incredible success
But God don't work for UPS or Federal Express
Better use discretion, life is an everyday test
Just to prove who da best
Fools hit ya with set of rules that'll use to do death
Then move you to the left
I trip on what the world is showing me
Wow, how many killers have we passed by in our lifetimes unknowingly
Refuse to catch signs that he throwing me
Maybe I should go and see, plant a God seed and let it grow in me

(Chorus) Ashlei Mayadia 2x
I know that you think that I'm at the end of my road but I got a long way to go 

[K-Rino]
"Mee cunt' folla ya evil trickz mon"
That's like telling someone to sit calm
With a man cuffed to his arm wearing a lip balm
Full of disgust plus a slave to my lust
I can't start trusting people till I meet people I can trust
Now I'm acting out of the ordinary
How can we be on the same page if we not even in the same library
Your perception of the planet is so slanted
To me your like sand, I'm concrete
But you keep taking me for granted
Now the thing I want the most of all
Is who'll remain here when the post is far
And who'll stick by the closest when the flow is stalled
In frivolous things you was so involved
Drugged and so in thralled
But no man can bost it all once his ghost is called
This composition was conceived in grief
Hand weaved to ease deceit from people who secretly disbelieved in me
I needed you and you needed me
Which meant that us needed we
But now the bridge is burned, so I'm a leave it be

(Chorus) Ashlei Mayadia 2x

[K-Rino]
What happens to a dream deferred?
And what purpose does it seem to serve?
When it's unheard and splattered against the curve
Can you really be redeemed with words? (I don't know)
And murder temptations steeming urge?
And exercise the demon that's submerged?
It's the 4th quarter, they put me in for all to see
My life is on the line, down by nine
And they keep on giving the ball to me
They got a full-court press on me
I gotta break it fast
I'm tryna locate a teamate so I can make a pass
They wanna subject me to doom and harm
I scan the room in calm to the conclusion that I'm the only one in this uniform
And the entire crowd is booing me
The defense still pursuing me, out to ruin me
They once loved me, now they through with me
I started dribbling then I shook this dummy
The ball slipped out of my hand
One of them rushed over and almost took if from me
It's loud and is a packed house
I took a shoot and before I can see if I made it
I missed it I blacked-out

(Chorus) Ashlei Mayadia 2x</pre>
