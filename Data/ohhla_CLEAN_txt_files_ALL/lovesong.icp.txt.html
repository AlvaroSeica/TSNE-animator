Love Song

"Hello, and welcome back to Pillow Talk
I hope you're with your bitch
Cuz it's time to get cozy with the ICP
So wind back with a sparkling glass of Faygo
While Violent J tells you the poetry
That just makes the bitches melt
Only on WLUV"

"Hello, baby
I was thinking about you
So I wrote this song
I like to dedicate this to the love
That has expressed from you and I
So just sit back and enjoy"

[Violent J]
Eh, yo, bitch, come over here and let me kick it to ya
Tried to stick my nuts in ya then I never knew ya
Cuz your ugly and you know you can't hide that
So what you look like a chicken with a hunchback
Oh, it doesn't matter that you from down south
If you talk like it, I'm a smack you in your mouth
Bitch, I admit it, I'm quick to hit a woman hey
But that's okay, cuz bitch, I'm Violent J
And I'm a southwest mack daddy juggalo
And you're nothing but a two-bit stankin' ho
But I love you and I hope you realize that
I don't care about the hair growing out your back
Smoking that blunt, drink some Mad Dog through the night
And your ugly bitch turns into Karen White
And I stick my wing-wang in the middle
I like a filthy-ass ho, the kind that make your nuts shrivle

[Chorus (2x)]
Bitch, I'm knocking at your door
Let me get some neden, ho
Bitch, you're ugly, that's okay
I'm finna hit it anyway

[Violent J]
I guess you want me to take you on a big date
But what you're saying don't sound all that straight
All I wanna do is feel your butt and squeeze your titties
Cuz I can't feed your fat ass on a buck fifty
Let's make love my sweet little dove
I wouldn't get near that neden without a glove
Cuz it's rats and spiders up in there
Hittin that'll take the curl out your nut hairs
I smack your tittie and claps when it hits the other
But I don't want em clappin too loud it'll wake your mother
Bitches always front like they don't wanna let you hit
But then they always screamin banshees when you gettin with it
So don't fake the funk, I'm nothing but a ghetto punk
All I'm trying to do is stick you in your fat rump
So get the fuck out them dirty-ass drawers
And come and twist my balls cuz I love you

[Chorus (5x)]

"You and I both know
That I've been wrong to you in the past
And I know that I love you
All I wanna do is slide my wang into your neden
I wanna hit that neden so damn hard
Let my nuts bang on your anus
That's my only true desire
I feel for you, I think for you
I breathe for you
All I want is a little neden
Ya know, everyday when the wind blows
All I hear is my nuts flapping against your booty, ho
And that's all I ever want
And that's all I ever dreamed of
That is you and your neden, bitch"
