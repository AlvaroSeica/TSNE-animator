Song:   Hold it In
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Take a massive, and hold that motherfucker in

[Chorus]
Hold it in, everybody gotta hold it in
Everybody gotta hold it in
Everybody gotta hold it in
Everybody gotta hold it in
Marijuana!

Everybody gotta hold it in
It's 4-20 my friends!
Everybody gotta hold it in
Fire it up!
Marijuana!

[Dirtball]
The fatter the sack the badder the rhymes
Any motherfucker wanna rip some of mine?
Gotta get up on a level where the universe shine
All the way to Mars and I mean it this time

Intergalactic the chronic on a platter
Cinematric I'm running up a ladder
Smoking atomic like it'll matter

Give me that bong let me show you the function
It won't take long till the floors are jumpin'
The blood is pumping, the beats are still bumping
Anybody wanna have a herb alunchin'?

Bring a bong and your bud and a good witness
Rip for rip we're doing marijuana fitness
Drop for drop we're gonna bubble that hash
double up on the high where the party at?

[Johnny Richter]
Flip the hat flip the bird
Hits of the bat, matter of fact we're setting records for sacks
Like we saw linebackers all for a tat

So who wanna blame us
Who wanna say for being insane in our brain
Propped out places, face said to stun
So when your stun your done
(Your done)

Stay to long son you might go blind
Smoking weed you'll find, on your mind is some grinds
And this is what you do when it's 4-20 time
YOU

INHALE
(Guess it's
EXHALE
safe to say that
INHALE
We stay high)
EXHALE
Now you're high

[Chorus: (x4)]
Hold it in, everybody gotta hold it in
(Inhale)
Everybody gotta hold it in
(Exhale)
Everybody gotta hold it in
(Inhale)
Everybody gotta hold it in
Marijuana!

[Dirtball]
Get up off my rights
Get up off my life
Get up off my, get up
Cause I'm smoked out and everybody outta think twice
COME ON

[D-Loc]
Many many many many blasts gotta a little crack around the block
when the block stays hot
Stack a chips in yo sock
Rubber band man rip around with a knot

Blowin' smoke rings because I puff a lot
I make shit pop in the parking lot
L.P. hits shots just for fun, we cut the crop we hit the block

[Daddy X]
We hit the block with pounds of pot
Bout' as strange as private stock
You think you know the goods, we got top shelf
Come take a pop

Whatcha think all the pipes was for vaporizers, bongs galore
Pounds and pounds of grade A dank
God is great, gotta give thanks

[D-Loc]
I smoke this shit I puff it tough
I got the chronic in my lungs
Break a stump my toke of death
Hold it in there's nothing left

Toke all day, my chest on fire
Buds all night we get no higher
Light the dank and pass the lighter
Smoke this bomb it makes you higher

INHALE
Guess it's
EXHALE
safe to say that
INHALE
We stay high
EXHALE
Now you're high

[Chorus: (x4)]
Hold it in, everybody gotta hold it in
Inhale
Everybody gotta hold it in
Exhale
Everybody gotta hold it in
Inhale
Everybody gotta hold it in
Marijuana!

Guess it's safe to say that, we stay high
Now you're high

[D-Loc]
One snap one several snap, I gotta can of Chronic
It's D-Loc what's happening? You gotta get it cracka-lacking
Let me crack this shit, let me burn another joint, let me burn another rip

I wan't to smoke this Marijuana
I wan't to smoke this Marijuana

[Dirtball]
Alright then let me get a bong toke
Let me take another one of them fat jokes
Black smoke, gotta a whole lot of venom
I wanna get a grip rip, J gonna hit em'

[Johnny Richter]
I come from the depths of the dark
Like a heave hit shark
Paint all the bowls that I spark
Setting off smoke alarms
You know that I got the bomb
(We got the bomb)

Guess it's safe to say that, we stay high
Now you're high

[Chorus: (x4)]
Hold it in, everybody gotta hold it in
Inhale
Everybody gotta hold it in
Exhale
Everybody gotta hold it in
Inhale
Everybody gotta hold it in
Marijuana!

Guess it's safe to say that, we stay high
Guess it's safe to say that, we stay high
Now you're high</pre>
