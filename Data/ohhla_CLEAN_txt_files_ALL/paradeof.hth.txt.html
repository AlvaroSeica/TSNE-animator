[Pressure]
Quarter to midnight, a scene of slaughter, I'm in flight
Red running water getting caught in the rip tide
Cars out of order, man I thought I could hitchhike
Sporting a chainsaw for I'm avoiding a fist fight
The evacuation went ahead
But bullet fire caressed my head, I was left for dead
Awoke in hell and knowing well the Feds had fled
Before the sun set in red
The witching hour that approaches has a host of
seven plagues, packs of locusts, rats and roaches
Fat and bloated corpses lacking focus
trapped in the throws of attacking that that's closest
Legs aching from the pace that I'm running at
Death chasing, ain't safe till the sun is back
Escaping the cityscape like a lumberjack
My wake's the only way I'm coming back
The city outer limits, found a house in thickets
Heard a shout and a shot rang out to witness
the foulest dead, disembowelled with gizzards
Their rival is his final hour or minutes
Numb with fear, holding gun to ear
He said "Run, it's clear till the sun appears
Tell my son his dear loving mum is near
See you in hell man, I'm done with here"

[Chorus]
They built my city on top of a grave
Now the dead roam the street like a rotting parade
They poured gasoline on top of a lake
and then they set it on fire so nobody escaped
They built my city on top of a grave
Now the dead roam the street like a rotting parade
Quarantined and forgotten for days
These are the stories of those who have gotten away

[Suffa]
I thought I might...
Drown in sweat when I heard the sound effects
of fingernails running down my fence
Was it rioters, rats or malcontents?
I pulled my blinds back a crack like Malcolm X
The scene was sirens, violence, car alarms
My neighbour waving from his yard with half an arm
Vietnam in the suburbs, the walking dead
"Burning Down the House" like Talking Heads
A city on fire, not a city of god
A city that hides from a hideous mob
The zombie flicks, man I've seen 'em a lot
Enough to know when it's time to get the fuck out of dodge
Uh, only packed the necessities
Toothbrush, porno, souped-up weaponry
and just for the fun of it, I stole my neighbour's Hummer
Put spikes out the side and tied a chainsaw to the front of it

I cut up heads and shoulders, knees and toes
Knees and toes, knees and toes
I cut up heads and shoulders, knees and toes
Knees and toes, knees and toes

[Chorus]</pre>
