Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Call me a fool if I don't know when loves infront of me
Oh no
&amp; Even on your worst day
I still rather be seen with you oh baby

Cause girl you
Make the stars come out at night
Oh you
Make a blind man see the light
Oh baby
When I get you in my arms
I'll never net go
Your More then beautiful, Your unbelievable
Woah oh oh oh Yeahh ay ay ay
I can't tell time when your around
So unbelievable
Woah oh oh oh Yeahh ay ay ay
Your More then beautiful, Your unbelievable

I can spend a hard day (spend a hard day)
Just watching you like TV
&amp; that'll be enough
Girl
When your right here with me
well like I hit that bottom read [?]
No I can't lie
You should be mine

Cause girl you
Make the stars come out at night
Oh you

Your More then beautiful, Your unbelievable
Woah oh oh oh Yeahh ay ay ay

Your More then beautiful, Your unbelievable

Cause girl you

Your More then beautiful, Your unbelievable
Woah oh oh oh Yeahh ay ay ay
I can't tell time when your around
So unbelievable
Woah oh oh oh Yeahh ay ay ay
