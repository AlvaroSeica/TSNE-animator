dark tourmalines, in troubled dreams caressing
stones dark and bleaker still, I hard engrave
cut facets in the thing, the world distressing
substance and the same, that words may save
our place upon this earth, already quarried -
returning tourmalines to surface of our dreams;
we walk on facets cut, our stress has worried
language lost and torn apart, the broken seams
repealed, the words collapsed and drying beams
as life turns substance, intricate and born.
the tourmalines of dreams murmur, deeper reams
of echoed worlds; their languagings are shorn
of time to think, inscribe, produce the neck
of things bent over, turn the poem a wreck.
