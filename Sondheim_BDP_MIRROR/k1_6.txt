(From someone named Sarah Kanji)


there are three strokes to the river, two strokes to the man
there are three strokes to the number, one stroke to the wand
the man strikes a feather with the wand
the feather bends in the fifteen strokes of the wind
the feather bends in the sixteen strokes of the wind
wind cries, you don't hear me anymore
wind cries, you don't see me anymore
"there are three strokes to the river, two strokes to the man"
there are five strokes to the fire, seventeen strokes to the iron
and there are sixteen strokes to the mercury, seven to the plant
from which springs all things
and the man strokes the fire with iron, and the man springs
hard against the plant, there is one stroke to the woman,
"men are not all things or plants" and "a woman is writing"
"a woman is writing this" and the wind cries you don't
and the wind cries you don't
and the man flows like mercury
down the iron fire woman plant river
"the man flows like writing" 
there are four strokes to the mountain, feathered like the wind
and there are a number of wands
[...]
