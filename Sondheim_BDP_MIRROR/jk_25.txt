Biography


Wanting autobiography and its thought, I've written the program below.

When I remember something, it goes into the .bio file. Later, the file is
sorted according to date. Later still, it will be downloaded; eventually,
a number of similar files will be chained and sorted together. The result
will be a mass of badly-remembered facts, comments, and apologetics ar-
ranged into semi-sequential order. 

The program is placed into an .auto file and aliased. It appears on login
after memo.

Someday, this will be the way everyone will remember themselves, in the
absolute absence of images - or the images will blur into text, embar-
rassed and shameful. Memory will become cited. Everyone will be cross-
referenced. The other will have not yet made hir appearance.
