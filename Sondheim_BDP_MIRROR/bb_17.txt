'If (a man)
jostle the daughter of a man,
(and) the possession of her interior
make let fall'*
he will lose the possession of his interior

And if (there is)
(a man) and a law
and the law is written and assigned a column
(and if) the column
is given a silver number,
then the man will obey that silver number

If (a man)
is assigned a silver number, then that man
will be given a ship-domain
based on the extension of that silver number
and if (a man) lives in that interior
then he will obey that ship-domain
or he will lose his ship-interior

If (a man) trembles
the daughter of an interior
and if a woman trembles
the possession of an interior which is a loss
then he (will become) a ship-interior
and he (will become) the possessor of a ship-interior
