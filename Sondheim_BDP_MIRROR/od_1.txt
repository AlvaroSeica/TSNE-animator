engorged, never devoured, never devouring. The gate-keepers float, it was 
absolutely gorgeous today. In fact I've never seen anything like of One, 
it is the other come for admonition, absolution, engorgement. Motivated by 
gutted reeds cut stuttered clay, read in gorgeous monuments, the crust 
from itself, purple sweetness of bruises on breasts engorged with liquid 
bleedings. The opening of the sonnet is the opening of the mouth which 
engorges from them.

They're _all_ in this pattern, engorge/disgorge: the _anorectic future,_

mouth's engorged, her genitals swollen, her frock and in their currency, 
in 2010, we're engorged with her, eyes blasted from world burns. The 
Engine burns, swells, disgorges; it is the world returned Engorged. You

Now gougings, gnawed of living words, these phrases engorged, descended 
from crags and split-swollen engorged spew of letters, oh grateful! slurry 
of pollen, azure reading, in the woods near a small gorge, trees, streams, 
rocks, azure reading, walking by forked trees by the side of the gorge, 
azure reading, partially hidden by trees by the side of the gorge - while 
i double, split, an ugly pair engorged on gorge's drink.

topple, it topples disgorges; it is the world returned to vomit. The

Spray


(as far as I know 1st internet-text dated post specifically to Cybermind & 
for Lawrence Upton who edited some textual confusion of mine re: "9. 
Therefore I produce as well st-* texts, which stutter, stumble, shudder, 
sputter, and so forth, texts simultaneously within "jouissance," anxiety, 
"frisson". (st-VC^2, "st," vowel, doubled consonant, referencing an entire 
category of words, which may go back to the origin of Indo-European words 
describing the oscillating, arousal, and contamination of an organism.)")

**********************

Date: Sat, 2 Jul 1994 01:41:57 -0400 (EDT)
From: Alan Sondheim <sondheim@panix.com>
Subject: Chatter



SPRAY


The relationship between chaotic distributions and a totalized phys-
ical source of emission is prominent in a class of words character-
ized by the format [<s><C1><V><C2C2><er>] as in the following
list: _stutter, stammer, scatter, shudder, shatter, spatter, sputter,
skitter, splatter,_ etc. (_Scanner_ inverts the series, _spackle_ and
_simmer_ transform it.)

A second similar form produces: _spew, skid, scud, spot, spit,
split,_ etc. These forms are constructed around a _lateral topo-
graphy,_ a laminar spray distributing over a more or less wide and
irregular domain. The spray possesses a phenomology of dissolution
and disruption; it also exists on the fuzzy interface between
interior and exterior, and hence involves abjection.

In every instance, the body is compromised laterally, a veering from
side to side, or the stammer from the region of the throat. Some-
thing is _withdrawn_ violently from the organism, which convulses.
Convulsions shatter, fragment.[1]

The lock-up of the terminal screen in Net communications is the
result of packet flow; email appears from everywhere; interrupts are
common; the Net harbors impeded laterality. Better to consider it a
convulsive body as well, the neural interconnectivity of nodes
serving as obstructed gateways choked with binary debris. The body
migrates to the edge of consciousness, received and processed by
one or another correspondent who circumscribes the messaging,
returns it to the relative fulfillment of sense.

The return occurs within an insriptive domain, part and parcel of
a potential well where meaning is construed. Within the well,
meaning develops the ontological being of language; without it,
meaning sputters, its attributive scattered among the remnants of
indirect addressing.

Only the shuddering of the human shatters the human; the human
stammers or stutters its way through debris scattered across the
splattered or spotted landscape. Deep within the throat the
promise of a primitive root is murmured or mumbled. Culture con-
structs itself upon the elimination of debris; the abject, now
gathered within the shamanistic fetish for the expulsion of male-
volent spirits, echos in the hiss of the cat or snake. These
animals are regarded with awe; they hold the mirror to culture
itself, the thin veneer of language and civilization binding us
to the symbolic. The hiss is imaginary; having no meaning whatso-
ever, it holds the meaning of the world. There are no boundaries
or borders, beyond what we make of them. There is no language
beyond our speech of it.

[1] See *Art Papers* 1/2 1994, "Throat: Leslie Thornton's _The
Great Invisible_": "_In the film,_ speaking is caught in the maw,
glottal stop, Edison and the _mechanical_ insignia of existence.
Early [20th-century] representations [of movement] operated with
mechanism throughout [as in the mechanics of the melodrama]; they
stuttered. Repetitive pistons and cams moved locomotives and film;
intermittent motion is translated into rotary motion and back
again. Throughout the century, mechanism gives way to electricity,
which gives way to the electronic, cyberspace and beyond. Thought
leaves the material domain" ...

If _beings_ are mechanism, _Being_ occupies an uneasy territory.
Aristotle stumbled through the part-objects of a generalized symp-
tomology of the world and Pliny followed suit. But organism never
spoke clearly and _always_ stammered; the hiss of steam, the
volcanic fissure, and the cat are _identical_.

Measurement and Ethos 


Give the Schrodinger's cat paradox, think of the mixed state as the trag- 
edy of the commons which ultimately reproduces itself through capital 
accumulation. What should be taken as the constituents of the wave equa- 
tion tending towards the sudden collapse with a particular eigenvalue. 
Wave towards state, spread over E3 space towards specificity of value. Set 
judgment equivalent to measurement. The field of behavior, environmental, 
particle, cultural, human, tends towards those moments of relative inter- 
ference. Measurement is performance judgment; the human sutures, closes in 
upon itself, defends itself. The wave equation collapses, the commons is 
bought out. Environmental factors of scale surely play a role; a murderer 
is punished as a result of the collapse of a nearly=decomposable hierar- 
chy, a moment in time when the bullet flies, the knife slips, burned into 
the genidentical four-space of an organism. Measurement is presumed, 
stated, neutral; judgment is presumed measurement, according to the law, 
i.e. according to the justice of an N-dimensional manifold and its fields. 
What mixes in the real cat, mixes in the law; what mixes in physical 
description is accompanied by a disclaimer, i.e. 'not a real cat,' which 
is part of the description. Nature abhors a vacuum but abhors as well the 
many-worlds approach of continuous splitting; it's messy, as is absolute 
and total relativism. Just as physics possesses no intrinsic ethos, ethos 
possesses no physics. Morality is situation- and ethos-dependent, event 
and law. Experiment is theory- and measurement-dependent, event and world. 
World and law, Law, are orthogonal, disconnected; to measure is not to 
adjudicate, but measure is to adjudicate. The stakes and foundation-spaces 
are orthogonal. Given culture, every judgment is orthogonal to itself, 
self-orthogonal, totalizing and split. Physics and ethos are entangled at 
the level of the cat; it is the cat that is at stake, dragging quantum and 
cultural theories with it. Both approaches reside within language; law 
pretends towards the exactitude of physics, with insipid results. Both 
tend as well towards mechanism: beam-splitters versus the panopticon, 
collapse of wave-functions (coupled) with incarcerations. Neither cat nor 
prisoner escape. In a hyperreal sense we are both; therein lies the 
paradox.


Collapse


When the wave-function collapses as a result of measurement, a quantum 
state results, for example cat-lives | cat-dies. What was entangled sud- 
denly takes itself elsewhere, to a value in the everyday world, a value 
that affects us, an effect. Knowledge unmoving, but knowledge given across 
solar systems, galaxies! What happens if an alien intelligence measures a 
pale - look, the experiment's hijacked! But we don't know this, we're 
doing, what, measuring away here, but we're the second? Meanwhile else- 
where, an observer watches... nothing... Disappointment! The experiment 
has failed! He makes a phone-call; it takes hours! What then? Perhaps the 
alien is just... barely conscious... on the order of a gastropod... a 
paramecium... Something just nudges the apparatus, perhaps not even paying 
attention... Perhaps it sends a signal back to us! Yes, well-done! A 
signal hijacked from the other observer! Wait, it gets worse! It's not 
conscious at all, just a pebble! Something falls, but since it's almost 
gravity-free, a level has become loose, perhaps the rockets... It slides 
slightly, what then? The button is pushed, we get a signal, the elsewhere 
observer gets nothing, we don't know we've gotten a signal, we've gotten 
nothing, we think we've gotten nothing, we think the other observer gets 
the other state, a different state - wait a minute, there's no response... 
We're on earth, a sunny day, we're waiting here, or circling the earth, 
replete with waves, acoustic, electromagnetic, the space-station shudders, 
the sun shortly disappears behind the earth atmosphere, just for a minute 
or two, a please twilight, my mind goes back to a walk in an Appalachian 
forest, somewhere in Virginia, we're holding hands, now she's so far away, 
elsewhere with her measuring, waiting, nothing is happening, did he forget 
me? I'm on the station, memory collapses, wait, I'll measure now, the 
first, just as I'm supposed to! A clean value, if yes here, no there, and 
if no there, yes here! But I hear nothing! Still, the situation seems 
clear enough, isn't it? A cliff, collapse, is produced, big entropy 
change, memories disperse, I'm focused now, waiting for her response! 
Nothing ever comes, the alien, slug, paramecium, lever, shuffles along, 
walks away, flies out, shifts, it doesn't matter. Has the world split? Of 
course not! It's the same old world! Think of the economy of multiple 
universes! But then in quantum cosmology, value's elsewhere, hardly 
calculated, split, split, and no split, it can go on forever...

Analog has moved to digital value, but where? Why? From whom? At what 
cost? Just how exact? Perhaps there's an error, perhaps there's a leak, a 
short-circuit, an alien...
