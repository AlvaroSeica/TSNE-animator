and many more besides, all buried, oblivious to users running elsewhere on
the disk, pictures and menus of perfect configurations until there is
nothing left of text or freedom: this is what becomes apparent in a class-
room, in a chatroom, in a seminar, in daily conversation. open source
means little in black and white and you may be sure that the prompt is
terrifying because it is an absence, not a pulldown-menu of preset possi-
bilities. the production of the web consumer is virtually completed. it is
unnecessary to know the vicissitudes of the Path which is always hidden,
meanders wildly from me to you. 'california body and a swedish heart'
refers to volvo, but i will give you my cock print if you will give me
your cunt print and we will trace the moisture drying across states and
countries, we will follow the scents of our meanderings. the bang path is
buried, elm is buried, whois, wais, veronica, finger, pfinger. but i will
give you my fingerprint, you will give me yours, we will be rusers, we
will be abusers, we will know them, we will trace them on each others'
faces...
