Jennifer Pilots Alan (Kybernetike)


Alan sits on the Web, the wires binding his hands and feet, his panties
creased by thin copper. Electric packets jolt his thighs, Jennifer laughs.
Alan loses control, his panties all wet, Jennifer laughs, spreads the silk
smooth against his genitals. Je nifer and Alan all wet! Tangled in the
wires, going nowhere.

There's nowhere for the pilot to go, waves of information soaked in every
direction. Jennifer-Alan's mouth is wet, urine short-circuiting Website
after site. No one notices; packets meander, take nanoseconds longer. Oc-
casiona ly a chara ter is lost; Jennifer-Alan body shudders in happiness. 

Beautiful skin inscribes inform tion everywhere, come closer, you can read
you on me, Alan. Alan moves closer, tends to Jennifer-skin; late into
those impossible days of September, 1752, they read each Jennifer-Alan
world, tied taut in the wires, eternal, burned into flesh-inform tion, you
slow-disappear nce into pure byte. 

Come closer, Jennifer, take me with you, in you. Piss-soaked wires sing
memory-remnant-flesh, cloister where everything writes. Wires are beauti-
ful, Alan. There are no cool sites, Jen ifer, my face buried against your
breast. Sizzled wires. In 1752, the calendar took days out, conforming
new-date-protocol. We're there, aren't we, Alan. We're never there, pilot
into node, spre d into black-hole protocols, string-theory vibration modes
wryting us forever:
