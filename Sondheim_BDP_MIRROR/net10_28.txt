Eith/urles, Signifiers in a Twelfth-Century Text, CMC


Is it not true that looking out through the parlour window is the same
as looking in, and to be avoided at all cost? For the Appearance is at
least half of the Crime, which our Lord has forbidden us. And speech 
as well is Temptation for the Idle, a Monstrance against the prayer of
constancy so beloved of Him who has grieved throughout the Flesh 
fallen for the purpose of our Salvation. No Sign must he have encoun-
tered in this blind Writing of his Body, no Stigmata speaking the par-
ticular Community of Redemption to which He hath given his life. It
would be Sinful indeed to presuppose otherwise, place Constancy itself
within that Cut pronouncing Nothing, but Piped to Absolution. Now, as
it is written in _Regulae Inclusarum,_ known also as _The Ancren Riwle,_
"My dear master," [Me leoue sire] saith some one [sum inouh], "is it, 
now, so very evil a thing to look out?" Yea, it is, dear sister, for the
harm that comes of it is evil above evil to every anchorite [ancre], and
especially to the young. Further, it is written in the _Regulae,_ And it
is written of Eve, the mother of us all [vre alre moder], that sin first
entered into her through her eyesight. And further, still, within the 
same Blessed text, Blow her not out with babbling mouth nor with gaping
lips [ne blowe /ge hire nout ut mid ma/thelinde mu/the, ne mid /geon-
iinde tuteles]. And from the last, does not the word _tattling_ emerge 
in the telling of it? To look through that window is to grasp what may
not be grasped, Also Bersabee th/urh th/et heo unwreih hir in Danuies
sih/the, Likewise Bathsheba, by unclothing herself in David's sight, 
thus a _story_ unfolds like and yet Unlike every Other. "As death came,"
saith Bernard, "into the world through sin, so through eye windows 
[eie th/urles] death hath his entrance into the soul." So doth this
Entrance have a Name or Portal? No, as the Cut upon the Arm of Crist
Himself? Down, down, with remonstrance, no Cut or Sign to Bring the
Sinner back to Life, she whom Death embraces! Thus, ASE MEN WOLDEN 
STEKEN VESTE EUERICH TH/URL, how men would shut fast every aperture!
and will not an anchorite stop up her eye windows against death of
hell and of the soul? And with good right may eye windows, eith/urles,
be called evil windows, eilth/urles, for they have done many an evil
to many an anchorite. Al Holi Writ is ful of warningge of eie! All 
Holy Writ is full of warning of eye! hwat is word bute wind? What is 
word but wind? For Touch there is no Word, neither within the parlour 
window, nor withoute, Wherefore, my dear sisters, love your windows
as little as possible, [al beon heo lutle] that they be little, - the
parlour's smallest and narrowest. Let the cloth upon them be twofold;
black cloth; the cross white, within and without. And we read now
further, it was ordained by God in the old law that a pit should al-
ways be covered ; and if any pit were uncovered, and a beast fell into
it, he that uncovered the pit should make it good. This is a very ter-
rible word to a woman who exposes herself to the view of men [wepmones
eien]. Behold that the Cross becometh two sticks behinde a skull, be-
hold that no Man may Read what hath been wrought, there are no Signs
for it. For, Almihti God, Feder, Y/ Sune, Y/ soth/fest Holi Gost, Sight
is not a Sign, nor the Pleasure of it, but a Poverty robbing Scripture
and the Cross. Therefore, Vlih into his wunden: creop in ham mid th/ine
th/oughe. Th/et beo/th al opene. Muchel luuede he us th/et lette makien
swuche th/urles in him uorrte huden us inne: Fly into his wounds; creep
into them with thy thought. They are all open. He loved us much who
permitted such cavities to be made in him, that we might hide ourselves
in them. Thus, Speak not but of the Wounde; the Wounde speaketh not.
