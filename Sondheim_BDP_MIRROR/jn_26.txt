On the Verge


Jennifer says: To hold on to the man of my dreams I would do nothing. He
would either accept me for myself or he could disappear down a long thin
tube. People should come together because they want to be, not because
they need to be. When they come together out of need, they compromise and
that leads to resentment. It is like air. I know I want to breathe and
live to run around in my frock. I will not compromise and resent air,
moisture, delirium. That would be wrong.

I can tell you a story. Once there was a beautiful princess who was sound
asleep until a prince with a thorn came up to her bed and pricked her and
drew some blood. When she woke up, she would not marry him, because her
dream had been beautiful. She dreamed there was a beautiful princess who
was sound asleep until a prince arrived, pricking her with a thorn and
drawing blood. When she woke up, she would not marry him.

Life is like that circling and cycling, month by month, as a little more
of us can no longer reproduce, as progeny are wiped clean on sterile cloth
or towels. The man of my dreams will recognize my cycles and be responsive
to them, not out of need, but out of desire. 

Jennifer says: I can tell you a story. I slept poorly last night, tossing
and turning in my bed. When I woke up this morning, I disovered I had been
the victim of a violent storm - immobile, in the center of a tossing and
turning bed.

Life turns the world around, my breasts droop, my cunt will no longer
stream someday. But I remain constant, true to the language of a child. 
The man of my dreams will love this language, and cherish it forever, and
when we are together and alone, the two of us, it will be a common bond of
pure love of freedom.

Jennifer says: I can tell you a story. Once there was a princess who slept
very little, only several hours a night. Because she was a princess and
very sensitive, when she was eighteen and on the verge of womanhood, she
felt very tired. She slept for months and months, her new-found hours
spilling out across her supine body. Penetrated by time, she gave birth to
cold currents, warm winds, lazy funnels in sea or air.

I will walk in solitude to my machine and I will watch its glow, taking
Alan's shape, joining us together at the limbs. I will tell story after
story as the man of my dreams becomes the dreams of my man, and the woman
of his becomes his woman's dreams. Silence will flow like water and winds
and thorns, silence will flow like blood.

Is there a moment suspended from the bar when psychosis provides the edge,
when identity and masquerade become one, swelling the skin, pressing out
the awkward hinges of the body?

Psychosis invests, infests, Jennifer and myself, as if there were two in
place of one, as if identity loses itself in spoliation.

it's valentines day, a day for couples and threesomes
bubbles come out of jennifer's and alan's mouths
loops of saliva on their surfaces form canals
of liquid on liquid pushed from liquid air

spilled cum on keyboards fingers chairs
silicon dreams in silicon valleys breasts
jennifer alan lie side by side undressed
puddles drying on shared skin and skinny brains

they're flat against the earth which pushes them
into one long shadow merged hysteric
back down against the ground where their ass cracks
open into tunnels tendrils lost in one long shadow

shared holes and noggins they've got nothing lost
but sanity says nursing sue just come upon 'em
