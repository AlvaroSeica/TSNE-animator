Shiki


A roof is a combination of a spinning-jenny and an overhanging cliff;
therefore it references a cliff with the turmoil of water far beneath. A
beam is a combination of a carpenter's square and double-bamboo; I smile,
thinking of the uprightness of the bamboo-grove on the mountainside above
the shrine. A wall is formed from the hieroglyphic representation of a
hand, coupled with magatama, the curved jewel in the hand which makes a
wall around the wearer. A floor is simply a field without stakes, and a
corner is a nest with a mirror reflecting the beauty of the room. A room
is a skein of thread holding shellfish deep within it. A great sky is the
murmur of a greater shout with the radical for root. Here I will take my
wall down and build a new wall. Here, I will spin silk for a wonderful
sash, and here I will wait out the storm of my passion beneath the spears
of rain, a combination of jewels beneath ancient double-arches, heading
towards the east.
