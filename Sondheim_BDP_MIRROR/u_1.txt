Some Dialog on the Way Towards Self-Hatred, Construct of an Ego


-You're afraid of men.
-I'm afraid of getting too close to men. They seem to want something
from me, do you know.
-They want something from you.
-They want to take me over completely, you know.
-Why are you telling me this.
-I can trust you. You're not like them. You're not like those other
men.
-I know.

-Do they make you shy or something.
-Do they. I don't know. I mean, I'm shy. I know what I want. I want to
decide if I, you know, want to get married. Like I get offers.
-You get offers.
-I get, well, an offer, you know. When I want to. I get nervous, what
they want. Not shy, you know, nervous. What they want from me.
-What do they want.
-You know, they want me, you know. Not like you.

-You're shy of men.
-What I have to say, you know. Like who I am. I need something, you
know. Like when I want to be alone. They want to take me over.
-Take you over how.
-Want, you know, things. I'll decide when I want to.

-You are hiding behind something.
-Just don't like crowds. Too many people. When I'm back here, you know,
by myself. I can do what I want to.
-I don't expect you to go out anymore.
-You don't. You want to go out with me.
-No just that you're hurting yourself I think. Alone.
-I get things done when I'm alone, you know. When I'm out I get nothing
done. I learn nothing.
-Hurting yourself, I think.
-Better than I was. You should have seen me then. Better than I was.

-Are you afraid of being unhappy
-I like this, you know. Nothing around me that matters this way. You
know, it's the same thing. What has happened and will happen, you know.
-Too many years like this.
-You know you don't see me. You're a good friend, you know. Not like
them. They seem to want something.
-They seem to want something
-Yes, they want something, you know. You don't.
