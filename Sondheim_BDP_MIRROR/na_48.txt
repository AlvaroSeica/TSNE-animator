My Eternity


I write ahead of time, that my readers of 2053 will perhaps understand me
and my lack of hatred for everyone who refuses to support me, who stands
by, who closes his or her eyes to the brilliance of a new dawn of writing.
And the readers of 2103 who will finally begin to comprehend, not only my
literatures, but my philosophies of truths or lack of them. And my
stupidity, which is close to that of Stendhal's, as if the future gathers
a promissory note which will never been collected. What is variegated now
will come together in critical coherency. No one can begin in this or any
other present. What will be will be. I will not mention my enemies. They
are legion. They affect me but remain outside my work. They are only of
personal concern. Their names will be forgotten. I will not honor them.  
Someone will write my biography - myself, I would be sued. I cannot afford
to tell the truth (in this regard). I tell the truth otherwise. The truth
I tell is what is important in 2053. You may have to look hard for my work
but my only wish is that it is available. And available in 2103. In 2103
it will be understood. My enemies will be long dead. My biography will 
include their names. Everyone I know will be long dead. Their descendents 
will have forgotten me. My work will stand on its own. My work will be 
read in 2203 and 2303. My work will continue to be read.

Philosophy Essay: Today's Thousand Character Essay News


Given that the Thousand Character Essay is a case-study in nominalist
style, each character in an fX -> (X,i) mapping, indexed by i (equals
relative position), a continuous translation into a relatively redundant
graphemic system is impossible if the stipulation is observed. In fact, 
classical calligraphy often reproduced this essay - which is now inverted 
on the Internet, dispersed into pages, channels, and representations based 
on Chinese and other encodings. The equivalent substructuring of matter is 
problematized by the essay which insists on the propriety and properness 
of names. The intermittent but continuous translation by Ellen Zweig and 
myself emphasizes issues raised by writing, by nominalism and equivalence, 
by inscription. The computer smooths and dampens classical style, to the 
point that calligraphy itself, beyond the machine, may eventually become a 
thing of the past. Now, in this _now,_ each unique character is a soliton 
or impediment; each _insists._ The text below documents this insistence 
across the Net. Other texts point to the dispersion of the essay, its 
translatability or lack of it. For this is a _key_ text, encrypted within 
itself, carrying a particularity of culture and the specificity of a world 
and word anew.

The Bird


Today Azure and I walked by a school-yard and she found a sick or wounded
pigeon, its legs loose and unable to function, flopping in the grass,
unable to fly - what to do - if it had remained there, it would have been
quite possibly tortured by the children. Azure wrapped the bird in a piece
of cloth and we took it back to the loft, where we put it in a box, gave
it some small pieces of bread, which it didn't eat, and covered it again.
Azure took the bird into the back garden, which is isolated from both
stray cats and the street, and right now, in the dark, it's huddled down
there, in a towel-nest, surrounded by bread-crumbs, with a shallow cup of
water nearby. It can't fly, its legs are paralyzed. It's the saddest
little thing. We don't know what to do. We're going to Pennsylvania, to my
father's house, in three days.  We're trying to keep it alive. Tomorrow,
Azure will call Audubon, and we might also take it to the vet. We can't
afford anything - we're dependent on their willingness to help. We will
try to find a wildlife rehabilitator. I doubt the bird will ever fully
heal. If it's sick, we don't know if it's dangerous to us as well. Azure
talked about keeping it here in the loft in a cage, but that's really
impractical. Right now I'm typing upstairs, and down in the garden,
suffering is ongoing. Buddhism has never helped my rage against the world
and its pain, exacerbated as always by human rapacity. We're trapped until
tomorrow. We hope the bird makes it through the night. If it does, we
don't know what we'll do.

Elegy for a Small Bird


which died this early afternoon. Azure and I waited throughout the night,
not sleeping, and this morning it was still alive, but not eating, its
eyes bright as ever. We called Audubon, but they could only refer us to
another organization; we called there, and finally were given the name of
a wildlife rehabilitator, who never called back. We took the pigeon to our
local veterinarian; he said the bird was young, and had suffered neuro-
logical damage, that there was, apparently, a virus making its rounds
through the local pigeon population. It still couldn't move its legs; its
wing muscles were incredibly weak. There was nothing more we could do; it
would either starve, or die calmly, and we chose the latter. elegy written

History


The deposits contain not only prehistoric artifacts but also extraordinary
records of fossil flora and fauna, making Hoxne one of the few paleolithic
sites where life on Balkan Peninsula and proofs for human presence from
paleolithic epoch were of terrain. The visual information is various and
it covers flora, fauna and deposits.

I began using augmented chords. I began using diminished chords. I jumped
equally among the keys. I located tonalities with grave respects. I
hammered out major seconds. I worked with astonished rhythms:

The great bombs fall incipient.

The furious pleasure of the violent president of war.

Daddy daddy won a country!

We fought the good fight, now we're out of sight.

...

I called the slogans and played around them. I described the slogans and 
the music playing. I played the music and called around it:

Furious motivations.

White culture death.

Obscenity.

Fury.

...

I forgot the music and entered space. I was in the zone. I went back to 
Hoxne. I was in Hoxne. I left traces. I was furious for an optimistic 
future.

Hot Springs Thermophilic Bacteria


We went back up the mountains south of Wilkes-Barre to the destroyed town
of Laurel Run. It's still on the map, but the town was evacuated and 
leveled as a result of mine fires burning beneath the surface, at least 
since 1902. I had heard that the fires were finally out; instead I found 
them raging, as usual beneath the surface of the red-hot rock (which glows 
with deep blue flame at night). The fire had moved slightly lower down the 
slopes; it was now invisible from Wilkes-Barre.

The signs said Laurel Run and Laurel Run Estates, leading nowhere. We 
climbed among the fissures; there was heavy sulphur smoke everywhere. As 
usual, the trees in the area were fallen and charred. The signs were there 
- of a furious and uncanny conflagration.

Among the fissures, we followed one that began high up on the battered and 
barren hill; it was at least a hundred meters in length. Half-way down was 
the hottest zone; smoke was everywhere. 

I examined the rocks and secondary fissures closely. There were odd 
patches of yellow, white, blue, green. Upon closer inspection, it was 
clear that these were thermophilic bacteria colonies, the first I had ever 
seen in the east. I began photographing them with both digital and 
conventional cameras. How did they get there? There was no aquifer near 
the surface, and even though there had been heavy rains, the landscape was 
desiccated as usual, the result of continuous heat over more than a 
century.

Now I will examine and report the find to the local geological society.  
Who knows how many new bacteria may exist there! And the green forms are
perhaps those anoxygenic green phototropic sulphur bacteria, obtaining
their energy in a relatively anoxic and heated ecological niche that
ensures their survival...
