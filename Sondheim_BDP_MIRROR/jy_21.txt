love and hate seize their object with inchoate distress
daily life releases and names it
without daily life, there would be no classical _things_ to occupy the
 world
_things_ are bounded by our knowledge of them, in all manner of porous
 waxe and wane
by which they are not bounded at all, see?
but there's always a question of recognition, acknowledgment, investment,
 in one or another order
and recognition is the tough one, since it's already a dialog
 considering information drawn out by syntactical / structural strategies
most of this is automatic, but it's that inchoate distress
 i'm drawn to, which scribbles across the rubble of the world, since
 nothing is born from or dies into history, but our own meanderings
 which again occasion dialogs, there are dialogs all over the place,
 whatever place one is talking about
and place itself, a question of recognition, acknowledgment, investment,
 or what might be considered 'the works' or 'the works of the real'
 as bandwidth's pumped full of surprises
 and distress gives us the pleasure of saying, hmmm... surprises...
meaning, ways and means, rushing all over, i almost said 'the place'
 or 'the place of the real,' what might pass for a thing or a signifier
 because the latter holds the former, doesn't it, would there be things
 in _fact_ if there weren't that matrix pumping away
it's got survival value, the body swerves among the world, and love too
 has got it bad, the world invested in a current between us say,
 you can see motion pictures there, hear perfect stereo audio
 maybe scent, maybe a touch or two
otherwise there's nothing and not even anything to be considered,
 not pleasure, although pain's an assertion somewhere in the midst,
 but i'd prefer watching the current sloping, you see the same
 in neon tubing on the way out, waves caressing the length, the beauty
 of the chaotic domain in pure response
to our approach, to us, to them, to you, just across any plateau
 recognized, acknowledged, invested, did i say
 information or language, did i need to speak, where is the real,
 where where where, where are you, where where where
