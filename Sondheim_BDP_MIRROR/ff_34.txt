How I'd Like to Speak, How I'd Like to Hear from You


"What is distinctive and remarkable about the voice that Marx and Niet-
zsche share is not only its breathless pace, its vibrant energy, its
imaginative richness, but also its fast and drastic shifts in tone and in-
flection, its readiness to turn on itself, to question and negate all it
has said, to transform itself into a great range of harmonic or dissonant
voice, and to stretch itself beyond its capacities into an endlessly wider
range, to express and grasp a world where everything is pregnant with its
contrary and all that is solid melts into air. This voice resounds at once
with self-discovery and self-mocking, with self-delight and self-doubt. It
is a voice that nows pain and dread, but believes in its power to come
through. Grave danger is everywhere, and may strike at any moment, but not
even the deepest wounds can stop the flow and overflow of its energy. It
is ironic and contradictory, polyphonic and dialectical, denouncing modern
life in the name of values that modernity itself has created, hoping - of-
ten against hope - that the modernities of tomorrow and the day after to-
morrow will heal the wounds that wreck the modern men and women of today."

(From Marshall Berman, All That Is Solid Melts into Air: The Experience of
Modernity, quoted in Robert Walser, Running with the Devil: Power, Gender,
and Madness in Heavy Metal Music.)
