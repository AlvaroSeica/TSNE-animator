Love


Totality of love, loving you, then these words spring from elsewhere, to
think, to be thought, what I, I described to Tom, Tom I said, rejection
_languages,_ look at separation, the mirror-stage emanating word, speech,
sound, incision of perfect sight, Tom, Tom I said, the signifier is born
in violence, cutting, always a circumlocution, the center cannot hold (the
center is constructed by normals to the tangents), Tom, Tom, I said,
rejection occasions the signifier with is siteless, procedes from driven
gesture or the thetic, but Tom, Tom, I said, it's the real that awakens
language, so that it may return unto love, silencing itself in speaking
the name of the beloved, so that, Tom, Tom, I said, the violence
disappears and it is not the case that love and hatred are oppositions,
there is no opposition to love, love like the maternal is not constructed
of difference, from difference, does not give ground to difference, Tom,
Tom, I said, you understand our friendship, empathy with each other, you
understand my love for _____, you understand how these words carry breath
within them, and Tom and I were silent, bullrushes swaying on the rooftop
garden, swifts crying far above and near, the evening clouds saying noth-
ing in the fading sky, I felt, I felt the slightest touch, her hand upon
my shoulder, her lips against my own, from a distant city, from a place
where the sun was high
