Multiculturalism's a lie; you can't reconstruct yesterday even in your own
country. Giving you a spectrum of cultures and histories is just that -
more theories, words, commodities, tourisms, "appreciations." I DON'T WANT
TO BE APPRECIATED - I want to be seen as other, to be incomprehensible,
just like you are to yourself, like you should be. All translation is a
lie, mistranslation; the only thing we understand together is the movement
of missiles from one country to another, either by land, or by air - armed
- on fire - coming on fast. There's no escape; nobody wants to admit to
radical incomprehension; more than ever, the world's supposed to be one
big book, admittedly of many languages, but the smile of Manunkind behind
them all. I, Daishin Nikuko, refuse to be part of all of this; I'll go
down with the rest of you - my physiology's the same, but not much else.
You won't even understand my final words, even if you could speak the
language. There's no language big enough for any of us. I look at you and
see: strangers. I look at myself and see: strangers. I'm the last honest
person - and you won't understand that either - I'm the only one who knows
that the world's expanding, not contracting - making way for the Big Deal
that will kill us all. - Daishin Nikuko
