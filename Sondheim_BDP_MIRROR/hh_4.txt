Just a Minute


Sarah Bernhardt had a 17 inch waist. I would say she had a "daemon." She
was so inspired. Her mobility occurred beneath her waist. Her voice hap-
pened from above her waist. Her waist carried her voice; directed her
feet. She was happy with her waist. When she played "Phaedra" it was not
in the sense either of playing "Mozart" or "Doom." Her waist angled be-
tween her mobility and her voice. Everyone who was anyone commented on
that voice. Her waist was _necessary_ in fact to its mobility. It was a
perfect unit of 43 centimeters.

Michael, in Julian Samuel's Passage to Lahore: "Nothing really matter ex-
cept this kind of thinking could produce flashy careers, loads of inter-
national travel, maybe even a noisy, safe screw at conferences in Paris,
or London: hand-job sperm on a laser disk at warp speed."
