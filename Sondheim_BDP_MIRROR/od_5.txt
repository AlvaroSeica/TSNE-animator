Cat taC


Set up the Schrodinger experiment as before. The cat-space contains food, 
a cat-box, water, a place to sleep, all comfort comforting. Conduct the 
experiment. Wait two weeks, check the result, then open the box. The cat 
is either dead or alive. What about the cat? If the cat has died, surely 
it would have died with the arrival of the particle. Naturally the cat 
would have decayed. If the measurement implies consciousness, then 
consciousness is retroactive, an absurdity. If the cat is alive, the same. 
Say it is the consciousness of a cat; use a plant, with lights, water, a 
happy atmosphere. If dead, then wilted; if alive, the same. Conduct the 
experiment with a mixing of viscous liquids. It takes weeks for full 
mixture. How far have we gone in two weeks? Either partial mixture or 
none. We assume in these cases the quantum measurement is automated; 
conscious doesn't enter into it until later. We assume we are simply 
reading an earlier result. If the jump occurs only at the time of reading, 
then we know the mix has been in abeyance. If it occurs earlier, there's a 
problem. What is the problem in case A? What is the problem in case B?

3 images what was on the roof i couldn't believe it
staring me in the face i didn't have a camera
( yes, i know i know... )
i sketched as quickly as i could i'm quite talented
i swear this thing was real

 <here later I will build upon Penrose's 3-sphere/world theory, 
  which I developed independently in 1971.
 <I use the notions of immersive and definable structures in relation
  to graph/networks which possess state or operator diagrams.
 <I show how specific mappings may occur between phenomenological,
  abstract, and physical entities.
 <I demonstrate how such mappings require phenomenological processes,
  self-contradictory and contradictory processes, and strictly defined
  processes.
 (I explain how such processes interrelate,
