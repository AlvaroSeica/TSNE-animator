Bodei: Shifter


Everything descends from root #1. Everything has a number. Everything be-
longs to the Order. 

I'm Nikuko. I do duplicate that order on the level of the visible. I doub-
le, triple, quadruple. I create objects shifted into others, apparently
the same. The rule of the same is boredom; beneath the surface, messages
seethe:


look Bodee

Lost in Bodee-Buda as Bodi Tre-Form Hells You see Bodei, Bedei, #934,
#895, #1, Girl, Boy, Bodi, Bodi, Bodi, Bodi, Bodi, Bodi, Bodi, Bodi, #1,
Bodee, Budi, Bedee, Bodei, Bedei, Budi, Bedee, and Bodee here.

I don't know which "Bedei" you mean.
look #934

look Budi

I defend myself. I don't let you in. I duplicate my numbers. I duplicate
my objects. I split and return torn inside myself. You can't come in me. I
make insides and insides. You don't find me and you can't tear me apart. I
can tear myself apart. You can't get me. You can't get the flesh the num-
bers the things, the #numbers the @flesh the $things. I horde myself. I
whore myself to myself. I buy and sell myself to myself. I short-circuit
your economy. I blast my way into you. I'm in everything you do and own. I
defend myself. You let me in. I duplicate my numbers in you. You're gone
to me. I swallow you.

You don't know which I I mean. (This could happen to me.)

You don't know you. (This has happened to you.)
