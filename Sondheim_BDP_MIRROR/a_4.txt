Talk of the Internet



When privacy is outlawed, only outlaws will be private.

When guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns.

When your friends are dead, only the dead will have friends.

When sex is a crime, only the criminals will have sex.

When numbers are indeterminate, only the indeterminate will have numbers.

When the network is really down, only the really down will network.

When Clara desires, only the desired will have Clara.

When the watch times, time is watched.

Where land is scarce, the scarce will land.

When death is cured, only the cured will die.

Where bandwidth is lean, the lean have bandwidth.

When only the good die young, only the old have evil.

Where we are silenced, the silent speak.
