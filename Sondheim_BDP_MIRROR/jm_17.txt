Quot

"You ask me, my good friend, if I know how to incite delirium, vertigo,
any madness whatsoever, among those orderly and placid masses that are
born, eat, sleep, reproduce themselves, and die. Is there no way, you 
ask, to introduce a new epidemic of flagellants, or of convulsionaries?
And you speak of the millennium?" (Miguel de Unamuno)
