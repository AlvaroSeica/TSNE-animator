God I couldn't believe it, I had this video class tonight and I went out
with three of the women in it afterwords and we went to the Greenwich
Village Halloween parade and there were queens just like those in Prisc-
illa Queen of the Desert, and we had this great conversation and the class
wants to keep meeting every couple of weeks after it ends and there were
some great videos we looked at and I have this crush on this woman who was
there and she was an extra on Saturday Night Live and makes these amazing-
ly intense video tapes and I had a nice glass of red wine at the White-
horse Tavern after walking the length of Christopher Street and I kept
thinking every .45 block, what the fuck with cyberspace? Why all this pain
and blockage 

when the night was drizzly and for the first time in weeks I felt actually
happy and that things were momentarily the way I always thought they
should be, at least every once in a while and for once I'll dream happy 
tonight and I thought think

the hell with Spoons the hell with theory when it wraps itself around pain
and politics and squeezes the hell out of life and that got me going so I
could come home, capitalize "I" even, and write a post about intuitionism
and natural numbers to Future Culture, staying with the subject, not the
wryting dripping from the glass-glass screen -

o wish this baby luck
