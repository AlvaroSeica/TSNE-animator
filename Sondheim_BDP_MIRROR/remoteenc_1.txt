[11:46] Flight Band: All Go
[11:46] Julu Twine: I think of the dance as a whirl without consent, like 
the body burning, or

 like a singer without a song, totally open to the world, no computer,

    I think of an inverted hysteria, the world as symptom of this



 it wobbles on pivots, it gyres on axes, it twists

and turns,

 it turns away the face, the face of the world is the dance





the world of the face is the trance





I think the hands hold old-fashioned canes and crushes these could be

                  quite dangerous wobble turn around





I think you leave holding hands





my heart

bursts open
