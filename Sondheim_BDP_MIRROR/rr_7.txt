My  Response -

When I think of meme, I think of iteration, of the trope of cleverness, of 
tropes in general. Clever, because like 'something going viral,' the 
metaphor, not meataphor, almost makes it, holds forth; meme of course is a 
meme as well, is viral. But this doesn't hold, doesn't hold up; liked 
Wired magazine, it's full of incandescence on the order of 'Forget all you 
know about [x]' - a form of hyperbole that damages thinking in depth. If 
anything meme is surface, and a metaphor of the surface; it carries the 
body into the instantaneous, where the body is imminant. The meme slides, 
slices, carries the simplified simulacrum of the characteristics of 
evolution otherwise, but carries nothing, is empty, emptied. I end up 
thinking of the slogan or the hook, or all those transitive aphorisms on 
Facebook that dissolve upon closer reading or thinking. We're skittering 
from surface to surface and for the first time in my life I'm glad of 
longer theory and its care; if we're ever to heal the slaughter, wars and 
extinctions on this planet, we have to dig thusly, and that's not a meme, 
that's labor.
