our friends have disappeared, one after another. listen: the phone refuses
to ring, we're not home, we might as well be: no one sees us anymore. no
one calls; people make arrangements, never follow through. it's as if we
don't exist. it's as if we're pure electric, ghosts in real life. it's as
if we're on the wrong end of language, curled in upon ourselves, foetal,
self-absorbed, self-devouring. friends have disappeared one after another.
the phone doesn't ring. no one calls and soon there will be no way to call
and no one to receive anything. potentials fray at the edges. i carry mem-
ories of spoons in my eyes; you can see them. there's nothing else realis-
tic or 'non' in the world. transforms Your on me...

ble to everyone.no one teet ut anymore. no one dalltK people make arrange-
gementt, dandel them out. it't at if we don't exitt. it't at if we're pure
eledtrid, ghottt in real life. it't at
uage, durled in upon ourtelvet, foetal, telf-abtorbed, telf-devouring.

your lost-body-skins are mine. lost-body-skins are catastrophic, cracked
in dim places in the midst of mother-boards; everything stops as cells
slough, dna replicates among the integrated circuits. inside we burn; i
hurry to the phone hour after hour - no one is there.the mail slows; even
advertisements aren't dropped into the vacancy of the house where we con-
tinue to eat, less and less. azure and i turn anorectic; thinned, our
skins show us more than naked, every pore exposed. azure says we're punct-
uation marks; i think ellipsis.there are no dissenting voices; our famil-
lies have given up on us. walking out of doors on occasion, we're invisi-
ble to everyone.no one sees us anymore. no one calls; people make arrange-
gements, cancel them out. it's as if we don't exist. it's as if we're pure
electric, ghosts in real life. it's as if we're on the wrong end of lang-
uage, curled in upon ourselves, foetal, self-absorbed, self-devouring.
