hymn to god my god in my sickness

that i may never free myself from the angels of the islands
that i may writhe in pain, like so much contraband
i cannot in good measure ascertain this
my head is the site of excavations
my arms flail against the work of the lord
his hosts disturb me and his minions are in triumph
over all creation they are in triumph
my hands tingle with the flesh of the slaughtered
my forehead is the host of armed marauders
yea though i walk in their fields
yea though they do not yield a thousandth of their grain
their foodstores i know them not nor their garnered temples
by all accounts naught is known of them
i am by all accounts a hymn to god my god
in my sickness i am known and in my pain i knoweth not

i do unravel and my mind unravels
i do weave and in the morn my weaving is undone
my body shivers with uncountable fevers and violence
my ears ring within the ringing of my ears
my heartbeat among them
my heartbeat continues but is counting down
i hear nothing remember nothing
i am lost and am a losing gone
i am in death and am a dying gone

in my sickness i watch myself and i am taking note
and of this accountancy, this is a gift for you
this speaking from the future anterior
this already calling forth for the summons of the body
forgive me o lord in my sickness
forgive me for the words i speak for they speaketh not
nor do they sound the trumpets of the holy
nor the walls of the city within and without
nor do they sound, nor do they sound
