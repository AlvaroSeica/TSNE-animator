Fractals, Stalker, and Texts*


http://www.alansondheim.org/NYU4/ qbasic and other files

The Fractals are fractal paths, produced from Qbasic programs I wrote; 
they're related to measure geometries, the kind of comb geometry you find 
on a ruler. The Stalker is a found object. The three texts are just that, 
short one-page texts. I've been going through my archives at NYU (New York 
University), and these emerged. The Fractals were completed about 15 years 
ago; the Stalker, earlier still, and the texts, earlier still. The 
Fractals led to a fair amount of writing about symmetries; the Stalker led 
to nothing; the texts led to more texts and more texts...

There were bear, and fields in the middle of kingston, and a dolmen in the 
yard. You're likely - dolmens stoned and stony isolation saves incessant 
devastation. Avatars are always disturbances, always irruptions of 
language, always disturbances by Nikuko, using warez programs, into IRC. 
We do look at ruptures or disturbances created by characters resonating. 
These disturbances develop the limits or margins of the program, reveal 
Nikuko, Alan, Jennifer, and Julu in another way as we will show how such 
define both the openings and foreclosings as, in part, the result of urban 
apartment cultures, with their emphasis on a photographically visible 
level. Misrecognition: Disturbances of Third-Sex-Ma; it overshadows and 
corrupts. Within time, urban existence becomes something else, somewhere 
else, a disturbance, uncanny, mesmeric. Will the computers be the smartest 
things in the universe? They were smart and smarter than me. The other

smart and smarter than me. I pray the smartest woman in the world will go 
in, she's delicious, it's easy to vote this election! Vote the New York

smartest state! The other girls look at him. He is the smartest boy in the 
world, and I am STILL smarter than anyone I've ever met, the smartest
