Who can tell what will happen in this topsy-turvy world, what the new day
will bring? Who can foretell anything in this floating world, where dreams
are words and words are dreams, where words dream sunsets and creeks spil-
ling over, flooding lands with waters and delights? In this fair world,
nothing is ever for certain, and we give ourselves up to whatever happi-
ness may befall us for the shortest while. In this evanescent world of
ours, butterflies may return to their chrysalides, clouds may pour forth
their very souls upon the earth. In this fleeting world, fortunes are made
and lost in an instant, loves sing forth upon new green shoots, and elder
logs make way for myriad and luminescent forms of life.
