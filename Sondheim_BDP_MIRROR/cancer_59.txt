if my skiff hits yours and we are sailing on a sea of dreams; and the
reflection of the moon's singularity spreads across waters troubled by the
collision, that such a reflection is also refracted in such a manner as
the luminescence of dreams

if beneath ourselves, disturbed by such collision, tremors arise, if such
occur, the violence of our nightly affairs carries through our lives and
those of our descendents

and who, dreaming, would i imagine such, what we have down in this life,
so unremarkable, so much of a potency, the skiff, the waters black with
ripples, the glimpse of moon's sphere, trembling, sounds of creaking 
boards, tall mast, furled sails, in night's dark wind, elements of boat
and water gleaming, and descending
