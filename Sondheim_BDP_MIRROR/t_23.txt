Outline of earlier work


The following outline, from my 1990 work, still relates strongly to the
writing I have been doing on emergence, the uncanny, and so forth. Al-
though it's almost completely obscure in this context, I still thought it
might be of interest here. The primary structure relates to basic catego-
ries of the world; the secondary structure to their inscription. Both
interpenetrate the other. Both emphasize creativity at the heart of the
real, thresholding, and so forth. The "level of the social" references
issues of identity, the body, and so forth. 


Theory Outline, Textbook on Thinking and other work:

A primary structure of processes as follows:
    Creation/annihilation/virtual particles/ 'scaling '
    Presence/absence/channeling
    Negation: chain/elsewhere/classical/non-classical/neither a nor b/a|b
    Temporalization
       ( Exchange strata/free and bound variables/memory/recall
       ( Gating/threshold logics
       ( Scope expansion and contraction
    ( Symbol conventionalism

A secondary structure of processes as follows:
    ( Inscription
    Demarcation/distinction xn-x = 0 sub-x
    ( Topology of intention:
    Recognition:
	Bracketing /context/symmetry/set/extrapolation/recursivity
	Neural networking/fielding/adaptation/thresholding
		Non-distributive transgressive logics
		Identifications .
   			Attributes/resemblances/taxonomies
   			Templating/defaulting/tag systemics
  Inscription components:
    Maintenance fueling/legitimation structure/embodiment/impulse
    Linkage (double bandwidth, abjection, leakage)/
    Representation structure P)Q, P)P, P)*Q, P)*Q)P, P)P)P etc.
    Decay modes
  ( Transformation of Inscription 
       overcoding/undercoding/(de)stabilization/exhaustion
    ( Chaotic-fractal topology of intention
    ( Symbolic order/mirroring (stage/apparatus/technics)
	( binding/narcissism/hieroglyph of the body/language
		( Freezing of inscription/one-infinity
Core Structures: inscription/mathematization (category theory etc.)
 Fissuring:
   Chaotic relation to substance and the real
   ( Pre-symbolic domain/chora
   ( Leakage of the signifier/excess/clutter/debris/noise/fluidics
     St: stuttering/stumbling/repetition/wobbling/jostling
 ( Erotics: fissuring/inscription/puncture/delirium/liquidity
 Gender: vaginality/eccentric space/binding/origin/death/displacement
 
On the level of the social:
( Economic parabola/body totalization/reification/production of self
   ( Fissuring of the sememe (overload condition)
     ( Hierarchy of reinscription, refiguring
 ( Destabilization between base and superstructure
   ( Mediating identities
   Compartmentalizations/schizophrenias/aphanisis
   ( Noise culture 0 = (x: x = -x}
 ( Postmodernisms:
   Constructivisms-essentialisms
   Flux-knowledge/noise/part-objects/un sub-x (descriptions) = event
