Margaret and Kierkegaard


 "Quite strange! In one of my first talks with her when I was most deeply
shaken and had been stirred to the depths of my being, I told her: that in
each generation there are a few persons destined to be sacrificed for the
rest. Most likely she did not understand what I was talking about, perhaps
I didn't make myself clear (in any case, only about my inward suffering,
really) least of all did I understand that it would start making her suf-
fer. But precisely her spontaneous, young happiness in juxtaposition to my
horrible melancholy, and in such a relationship as ours, compelled me to
try and understand myself; for I had never before suspected the extent of
my melancholy; I had had no true yardstick for measuring how happy a human
being could be. 

"Thus I believed myself sacrificed because I understood that my suffering
and anguish made me inventive in delving for the Truth which, in turn,
might benefit others." (Diary)

Of course it was Margaret who left me; the Truth is now the truth under
erasure; I've never benefited anyone; I have not gone on to write book
after book, but only drivel into files; and my suffering, if anything,
produces nothing but a dark horizon beneath which thought and humanity
suffocate.

This is how literature lies; this is how you tell the truth to yourself.
This is how you lie.
