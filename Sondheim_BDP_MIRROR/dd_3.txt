fgrep 'hole' /usr/dict/words > ff


My armhole had a sleeve with a
buttonhole fastened with a silver pin protecting me against the
cholera caused by
cholesterol - the result was I had to hide out in a 
cubbyhole of an old house, reminding me of the
foxhole in the last war - I was scared, talked myself into a
hole as if I were
holeable - placed, in one form or another; I know you watched through the
keyhole in the side of the room ceiling of the room, but there was a
loophole in the whole thing, sending me down a
manhole back to the beginning of the world; you saw that through your 
peephole, called me creep, tried to
pigeonhole me, but I put a 
pinhole in your image, you loved me well and we made it in a deep
pothole created by glacial waters, almost like a 
sinkhole - I confessed my gender changed so quickly it was no longer
whole but you said you wanted me anyway, with a
wholehearted smile you usually reserved for people who were in the
wholesale business of selling you and me, not a very
wholesome thing to do
