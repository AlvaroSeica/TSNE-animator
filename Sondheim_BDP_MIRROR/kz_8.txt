   Kung-Sun Lung, Road Movie


   Tell me, Nikuko, is it true that white horse are not a horse.
   Well, Julu, white horseness is not horse.
   And is it true that a horse is not a white horse.
   Certainly, Nikuko, horseness is not white. 
   Say more, Nikuko.
   Well, a horse is designated such by a mark which is not of this world.
   And Julu, a horse is pointed to by its designation.
   Further, Julu, designation points out a horse which is its name.
   I see, Nikuko, what is named a horse designates it as such.
   And the as-suchness of a horse is its designation.
   Tell me more, Nikuko.
   Now, Julu, the as-suchness of a horse is not white. 
   And, well, horse have no as-suchness as such.
   Further, Julu, horse are not white.
   And so, Nikuko?
   Well, Julu, horseness as-such designates nothing.
   And nothing is white.

   Look Nikuko, said Julu, it's without resolution. 
   It's stayed that way, without resolution, like a broken beam.
   (Broken seed, broken sword, broken arrow, broken cairn.)
   It's remained because it's impossible.
   Let it be, said Julu.
