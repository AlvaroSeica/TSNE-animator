"The end approaches, now it's too late to tell the truth about 
the apocalypse. But what are you doing, all of you will still 
insist, to what ends do you want to come when you come to tell 
us, here now, let's go, come, the apocalypse, it's finished, I 
tell you this, that's what's happening."

Derrida, Of an Apocalyptic Tone Newly Adopted in Philosophy, in 
Derrida and Negative Theology, ed. Coward and Fosbay, 1992


[...]"Amery argued, was that torture destroyed the world as the 
sufferer previously knew it. One of the most 'fundamental 
experiences of human beings', he observed, was the 'expectation 
of help': hot-water bottles, cups of tea, analgesics are 
routinely given to those in pain. In contrast, 'with the first 
blow from a policeman's fist, against which there can be no 
defense, and which no helping hand will ward off, a part of our 
life ends and it can never be revived'."

(Joanna Bourke, The Story of Pain, quoting Jean Amery, At the 
Mind's Limits.)
