Recent Texts: Explanation


Recent texts have mucked with both sendmail and figlets (ascii art) pro-
grams; the former's debugging led to full disclosure of protocol and mech-
anism within sendmail proper, and its sendmail.cf file with rule sets for
processing addresses led to spew-text. (Spew-text shunts rules into sub-
stance, implicates the roar that processes every muscle or neuron of the
Jennifer-body, html-body, ascii-unconscious. These texts bring marks, sets
and implications to the surface; substructure becomes superstructure. What
you see is not what you get; what you see is what you get _here._)

Behind every message, every protocol, languages and symmetrical substruc-
tures operate biomechanically; consider cyborgs from the inside-out, from
the placement of silicon process enabling organic termcaps, not the other
way around. Or in addition. (Jennifer-cyborg begins and ends in silicon,
follows the parabolic arch of tool-making, reification, into and out of
bodies of flesh. SOMEDAY WE WILL ALL LOOK _OUT_ FROM THE SCREEN, NOT INTO
IT. Someday the emphasis will be unnecessary.)

The figlets disperse avatars as well; Jennifer rides from socket to socket
and from program to program, interpenetrating client and server. There's
no end to her, no end to the armatures at work on the Net.

I do anatomy; Jennifer does me: anatomy is shape-riding-Jennifer. The rest
you can con/figure out for yourself.
