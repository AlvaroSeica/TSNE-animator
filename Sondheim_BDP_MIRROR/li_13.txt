Repeated Entries in the Ruler Program: Narrowing the Focus:


r1 3 6 3 6 2,2,2 2 4 0,0 
r1 3 4 0 0 2,3,4 4 4 0,0 
r1 2 4 0 0 2,3,4 2 3 0,0 
r1 4 2 3 0 2,2,2 3 3 0,0 
r1 4 2 0 0 2,2,2 2 3 0,-150 
r1 4 2 30 0 2,2,2 2 3 0,-150 
r1 4 2 30 0 2,2,2 3 3 0,-150 
r1 4 2 30 0 2,2,2 3 2 0,-200 
r1 4 2 30 0 1,1,1 1 3 0,-200 
r1 4 2 30 0 1,2,1 1 4 0,-150 

This obscure list of numbers represents the act of hunting, the narrowing
of focus, filtering of information, locking in. The lines were tuned, each
in relation to the previous - in order to produce certain patterns. What
happens among the repeated entries (each beginning with r1) is paralleled
by the continuous internal mapping of savanna topography, searching for
game. It is one and the same; we were born reading the world - always
already rewriting - and born into dying, the world reads us.

Alanydd drny Thanks for this - I'm online several times every day - even
without trAce, that will continue... yours, Alanydddd v ddddp -dd ddixpppp
irn This is a great response. I also think the narrative elements need
tuning with the rest, or elimination possibly - but I like the shredding
of the text. The next pieces wioll buill build on this of course, they'll
be tighter. And naturally I'm really glad you came! love, Alan ys rny Yes,
re: qualifying the qualifiers; there are qualitative changes in standards/
typifications/expectations as size diminishes for examnple - there have to
be variations. This is also related to legacy systems in computers - the
presence of older artifacts among newer systems - often development occurs
along borderline/fringe areas, while kernels are left alone (not true in
linux of course!) -0 Alanydixn -rnn A stupid question = could you give the
conference /title of thread to me again - I've misplaced and searching's
difficult... thanks,Alanydixnnvv yq qy---i<<rnn Most odd that the full URL
isn't given and I was taken to a fascinating file, PANIXCACHE! surely on

are you there in the future

Mon Feb 28 18:19:50 EST 2000 hiding out as you tunnel beneath a beautiful
meadow, you smell the scent of moles, cross the eerie spaciousness of a
rabbit burrow you turn into tubes of earthworms, i am there, turning
topology with me, knots unraveling, coalescing no, you are many, there are
nematodes, rotifera, stentor, hidden in packets of lubrication, pulsing of
loose earth, slight scuttlings among root fibers, decaying leaves of
maple, oak desires one with the earth, planet, mulch, inhaling my fabric,
my broken veins, my mottled skin against your decaying flesh, amoeba,
rapture faces of full earth, dirt soaked with rootlets, larva slowly tumb-
ling in their nests, the wandering nearby a burrowed spider, my identity,
you are breathless, silent, cocoon-wrapped thing devoured by buried wasp
you turning within the cocoon, not thinking, fungal strands, slime mold
coalescence everything in your eyes, your mouth the speech of things
inhabiting gums, tongue, stumps and sockets of teeth turning against you,
i think it is you, is of you, are you there Mon Feb 28 18:26:42 EST 2000
