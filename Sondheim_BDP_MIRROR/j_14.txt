Spreading my body open, letters, graphs, descriptions of all sorts, poured
forth from my hole, first the S, then the p followed by the r; shortly af-
ter, the e, then the a followed by the d, i, n, in that order, g lending
itself to the following space beginning the m which was shortly followed by
the y and then, behold, an other space, then a b to be sure, an o, a d,
succeeded by a y and another space, more to the point of the o leading to
the p, the e, the n, after which a mark of punctuation, , followed by that
blank space portending a recommencement heralded by an l, an e, then two
ts in whatever order they desired, it made no difference, subsequently an
e producing the effect of an r and an s, then immediately another comma, ,
and the whole thing begins again with a g, subsequently r and an a leading
to the p ...

And to cut into this infinity, my legs spread to the utmost, my hole divi-
ding into one, two, many holes, into a fractal dissonance of holes, my
ear enlarged, reaching down towards the vicinity of their rims, where I
could just perceive, sustained, the h, the s, followed by the pause and
silence of the comma, the huge space or chiasm bridging the arrival of the
third d, the fourth e, the fourth s, and my tongue as well

And to cut this into finitude, sustained elongation towards many, many 
holes, only to twist within and without the rim, seduce the rim, bend the
rim towards the mouth, towards speech, towards the reception of the c, the
r, the i, and I had better slow to a halt here, at this point of the tongue
or other organ, this clitoral or vaginal movement, silencing the sound
which the ear caresses, dimming the light on the chiaroscuro blush of the
rims, opening only into the murmuring of touch, the whispering of taste,
the almost inaudible smell, musk, fragrant, the p of pleasure, the t of
tongue, the i of sight, the o of elongated breathing coming to an n ...
s reverberant, space
