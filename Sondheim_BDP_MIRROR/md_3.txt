and kill you and you can do nothing to stop me.

terror and your Armageddon and I am your slayer.
$ bin_Laden know this that I am your slayer for I shall have infinite 
retribution against you and your followers who wreak havoc upon the waste 
lands of this earth and wreak havoc upon the gates of paradise.
$ bin_Laden you are my verb of the object of just murder.

from the front


difficult to write hanging specifically from several hairs of the bin
 Laden beard
  from this vantage point it is clear that whatever i write today will no
   longer be true tomorrow    
    it is from here nonetheless that i can only ask, should we not, so
     specifically, drop parcels of food so as not to make a mockery of
     relief workers, and instead leave people in a worse situation, if
     that in fact is possible
      and from the other nostril i would like to ask if we should desist
       the air land and sea campaign and admit defeat in honor of our
       several thousand already dead, but excuse me while the bin Laden
       beard does its duty in the frequent sipping of coffee, it is
       difficult to stay awake in this place when there is so much noise
       outside
	and i can only ask, should we not, so specifically, keep up our
	blockade of Iraq, which hardly makes a piece of literature, but
	does a reasonable job of killing the innocent children, and
	should we not, so specifically, keep up our full support of Israel
	no matter what horrors are committed on both sides, instead of
	positioning ourselves equally towards both Arab and Jew
	 i am getting sick swinging back and forth, there must be some
	  praying going on, should we not recognize Cuba and drop our
	  embargo, it is there just off the shore, waiting for trade and
	  Bueno Vista audience
	   this constant praying gets me sick, everyone throws Korans,
	    Bibles, flags, and human beings into the mix, when i sleep by
	    the left part or the right part, it never ever stops, surely
	    whatever god there might be is sufficiently vicious to let us
	    fight it out in its dubious honor
	     i must be moving now, one can only hope this beard holds
	      still once and for all, where have all the animals gone,
	      where have all the plants
	       he has named his beard The Furious Slayer
		there is anthrax hereabouts, i will be gone in the white
		 ghost of this death, let us leave life to another,
                  i'm getting dizzy, don't like hanging by a hair
