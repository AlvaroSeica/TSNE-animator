For G


[I wrote the following html for D S Hendler's novel G, which is under con-
struction; I think it is of interest as well as a standalone. If you want
to look at it in Netscape or MSE (or lynx, for that matter), cut within
the dotted lines and save as frame1.htm - NOT as frame2.htm, no matter
what it says... D S Hendler's response follows the html and is quoted of
course with permission.]
