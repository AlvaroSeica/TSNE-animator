Deer Felled by the Dust at the Doorways to Cyberspace





Sometimes I think all I have to do 

is move further into the realms of ideas, 

deeper into the sluices of cyberspace, 

cast-off the fishing netting running through the slurry of minnows

cast off collapsed on the decks of boats submerged forever 

o beautiful divers



relegating then looking around at these o so impoverished surroundings, 

one thin screed of paper enough to black out 

the terminal desires muted digital symphonics 

construct at the drop of pin or skirt



nothing here beyond the dust making sense leaking out 

from every pore of the skin which what. which collapses. 

now this space of absent harts, deer, 

every singular animal pounding its hooves into my chest



blessed or wounded our wounded sailor, or the wires short out, 

wires bundled molten into one another 

soldered real _things_ in this real soldered space, 

your eyes stitched wide for the telling of them



the _blessing_ as I said of the dust which felts the embrace of air 

required by dogged computations, dust against the daily reminders 

against the atlas of european nations 

against the text of unix command-line performance of the wounded sailor



alone but for the fish when his skin slits open for the emergence of eyes

alone but for the haze from factories boiled below where the busses stop

alone but for the paper threatening the monitor screen, sirens, my ears

my hands my fingers blinded



I am dying of comsumption of dust, pneumonias with tuberculor lungs 

rotted through the bleeding gums of degenerated tissues and longing



dying as the cotton coats the tongue, eyes filmed over 

with the promise of invisible and silent real sleep



"Dust!" she screamed: "Damn you, it's all dust! DUST!"
