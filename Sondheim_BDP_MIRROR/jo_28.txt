Gopher /Ruins


Gopher is being retired; the menu- or information-driven system for ac-
cessing the Internet is being absorbed by Web Hypertext. See below, based
on a search of international organizations. What the lists refer to are
gopher-ruins, archaeological remnants of searches still on the Net - the
United Nations daily highlights, for example, running out in March, 1996. 

I miss gopher. I miss the variety of access strategies, including the Web, 
Veronica, Archie, Gopher, Wais, and others... Everything is absorbed into
the Net/work, which, like the single newspaper in smalltown America, sub-
tlely controls everything through invisible protocols, other webs of its
own, tendrils...

For better or for worse, the Web is _it,_ and as with any totality, mono-
lith: Beware!...
