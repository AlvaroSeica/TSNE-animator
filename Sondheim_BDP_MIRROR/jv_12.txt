1. Bitmap editor in linux creates a _maze_ icon.
2. The bitmapped maze is _slid_ and transposed; these operations disturb
the path which, nonetheless, is capable of reconstitution.
3. The maze is _enlarged_ and changed from .bmp to .gif.

This construct parallels works exhibited at the Bykert Gallery in which I
created texts coded according to a folded mapping; the pathways out, re-
cuperation of the original, branched at every point. 

But this construct is also the body of Jennifer-Julu, multiply-connected,
transposed and transfigured, as in the ecstasy of St. Agnes, or St-Antoine
just before his disappearance into the absolute of the Christological sig-
nifier. 

Thus my maze is close to dis-carding, an elimination or forgetfulness of
the _sliding symbol, slidmaze,_ or the intersection/node of pixel-flesh
and symbol.
