We fill in their gaps, but it would be incredible, if we didn't have to -
and that will come, after us most likely - we won't know - just like
theories of universe - they've got the genome, but not the cosmos - it
feels like we're on the brink of something - that will come after us -

it's odd with Azure - she's 33 years younger than me - people take us as
father and daughter, it's understandable but disturbing - but we do well
together - for me there's always this thing, though - that she'll live
probably more than 40 years past me - she'll see things, like my daughter
will see things - that I can hardly imagine -

nothing's been solved, I was looking at live crayfish in a tank today,
watching and understanding their territorializations and thinking, we're
all so primitive, we can hardly speak -
