Using reverse reverberation, it's possible to create a 
simulacrum of time reversal, the spatial environment itself 
producing the sound, which always follows, always ensues. 
In other words, spatiality, temporality, produce the sound 
which is emblematic, responsive, to the exigencies of the 
aural resonance, and likewise, the human body, the body of
the musician, is an emergent property of the whole. Space
is a dwelling in eternity, and speech has already been 
spoken in a form of future anterior. Behind us, we find
ourselves in the future, and before us, the anticipation
of a creation yet to come. *
