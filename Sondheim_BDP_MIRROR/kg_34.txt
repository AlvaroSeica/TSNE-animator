Parable





And Daishin Nikuko had seven brothers. And she dreamed a dream, that a

stone appeared to warn of danger to the people. And she dreamed another

dream, of another stone against the first. The brothers reported the

forest of stone. Daishin Nikuko could find no peace.*



*This parable is inspired by a stone at the Hakozaki Shrine, which rises

to warn of danger to the people, then sinks again into the earth, in times

of peace. Of what merit is the tale, then, which is hardly an expansion,

only a recasting or parallel moment, in relation to the original?**



**Of course there is no sinking, only the forest of stone, by which it can

be assumed that there are many wars, many peaces. And it may further be

assumed that this is the split from the parallel, a dispersion of logic.

So be it, said Daishin Nikuko.
