Sermon on the Mound by Jennifer


The Cock is so stupid and Insignificant, I am saying under the sign of
Catherine Clement do you know her? That it is inert, repetitious and
Full of our Meanderings. So that We do not Talk Cock, that is a Moment 
of what might be a Considerable grain, have you looked at Cock up close 
and then Wondered how your Theories fall apart in the Proof? Because I
cannot Do this for too Long, this Look at the Up-Close Cock, I mean the
first Thing you Notice are Pores and other Holes everywhere There and 
in the Middle of such Hairs as you will never See in Perversion. So is
that an Unknown Horror to Dream of and not to Disparage as you might on
a fair Day in Perversion. You will know what I mean. It is never or
Nary a Cunt, Nary or Never a Discourse, when you are that Close that
it is as if the Bed left Marks impervious. I am Talking to You. Those
impervious Marks. You will look at Stains up close, why there are Stains
on this very Chair upon which I am sitting, Leaks from my Panties, you 
will know how Hardness the Twat is, you can almost Smell it. Up Close 
Like a Gulliver wandering, then I know you will Know the World which is
what Surrounds you. Then and Precisely then, When you can Speak, Then
you Will be ushered into Silence, nary a Thing to Say. Thus I might say
from Perversion, you will have been Bound by the World, but you must
Know, if the Last Thing, it is of your Doing.
