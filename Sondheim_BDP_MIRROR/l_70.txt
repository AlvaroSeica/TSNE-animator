We are cyber-shamanisms, we extend the body into blank spaces behind the 
head, extend the body down below where the posts are blank blank blank; 
those of us who write the entrails the debris of space, torn fragments of 
time: I fucked you in 1932

Those of us bulging the body in the well, ligaments down _there_ world 
down _there_: you put the cover on the well you put the cover on the well 
you put the cover on the well you put the cover on the well you put the 
cover on the well

You close the gape gap hiatus chiasm crossed by ligaments down _there_ of
your desire: you soft reboot hard reboot; you kill delete; you hex it: 
check it for virus: the virus is the smell of our holes: those of us
sloughed in the entrails: 

Check out the hard drive soft drive: piss travels the interior edges of
the computer casing; blood leaks from the floppy slit; cum etches the 
CPU, shit covers the motherboard-fatherboard:

You turn the machine off, burn the disks, corrupt the files:

O Malevolent Light Glows

hard drive tethered to the thin winged arm, head reading data hard data: 
_you put the cover on the well well_
_you put the cover on the well well_

you smell your holes everywhere against the lip of the screen, pull the 
plug, cut the circuit breaker, smash the fuse, cut the wires: you say 
nothing I pull my veins out for you: you say nothing:

miracle of cartoons you put the body in the well, you put the cover on 
the well:

O Violation Fabric of Torn Space and Time!

Tiffany rags on me, I go inside her and up through her everywhere, I am 
her favorite parasite

She shows me what to see through her eyes I see the well an open hole

& there are no fuses in this beautiful kingdom, and no wires, & there are 
no screens in this space of miracles:

My love is not a macro! 

(Tiffany extends her hands through the keyboard down into her)

(Tiffany teaches me everything)
