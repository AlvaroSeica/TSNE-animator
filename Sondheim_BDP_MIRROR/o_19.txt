Subject: Future on the Net




Where are we at this point of time on the Net? This is surely a time for
Net histories to be collective - the machinery on the verge of decent
video; I downloaded readers for Vdolive and Streamworks tonight and ran
them successfully - on one, Finnish jazz, spoken word, and images; on the
other - corporate executives. The former also had continuous Ottawa live
feed on the audio only. Powwow is more advance; Iphone sounds good - all
of this stuttering across the Net of course, not to mention MIRC, Global
Chat, all the other competing forms. So this is the time for someone more
skilled than myself to take a snapshot of all of this, including Worlds
Away, all the MOOs, MUDs, Moose, Talkers, MUSH, all the machinery out
there, all the Newsgroups, the beginning of tidalwaves of spams - the huge
increase in gopher sites, email lists, Usenet up around 14,000 on Netcom
alone - a swollen maw of language, images, sounds, shrieks, programs, and
it's time that all this is recorded - someone running continuous download
or logging of pictures, texts, someone running videocameras or gathering
software as antique, someone capturing the deadspace of the MOOs. On PMC2
MOO there is a device called the Monopticon; everytime you blink in it, it
takes you to another site; type "exit" and you can end up there. But PMC2
like other spaces has a lot of older disregarded abandoned machinery; it's
more a house of ghosts, even with the surface life. Who or what is recor-
ding this? Where are the necessary parallels to oral history? We are about
to step into cyberspace, those crackling voices reminiscent of early rad-
io, broken tiny images reminiscent of early television (Felix the Cat was
the first transmission I believe) - soon we'll forget the origins, just as
television-now is a land of forgotten histories, as we uselessly devour
the new. We are about to step into cyberspace, and someone, somewhere,
must record the footprints, abandoned, our always already forgotten
selves.
