For the Paris dance performance I play shakuhachi, naked, on video; for a
long high and broken note at the end, I come repeatedly. Just as shakuha-
chi requires careful breath control, so does sexuality appropriate the
breath and chakras, inundate the body with the imaginary. I sense a second
body rising from my own; perhaps it is your body, perhaps that of Jennif-
er. It rises and it makes a long high keen as the erection subsides. It
escapes into the air.

It's not a rib that's gone, it's not a mind, soul, hymen, torn tissue.
It's the perfect holding of the perfect note as your dreaming flesh car-
esses mine. It's a sound I can't play but the breath inflates myself as
perfect partner. Let me be your rubber doll, the holes for the making,
breaking, taking.

For the Paris dance performance, it's perfect cyberspace and all that nar-
rative filling the gap, as I build your fingers into my body, Jennifer,
Jennifer, as I build your fingers, one by one.
