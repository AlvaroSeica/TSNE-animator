susan's "and the aliens"


"and the aliens, where are they, in our desperation,
looking for large eyes or things which dwell within us or 
within our identities or equivalences, sliding ourselves
into a more dangerous universal womb, but at least the womb
which doesn't show, exfoliate, closed labia just as
they refuse us entrance - that there are none of them,
no scripts, no continuities but our own hysterias seeming
to construct semblance, so that now we substitute the net
or art or just about anything else, else which might nonetheless
turn ashy in a universal conflagration generated by the smallest
flesh or flash, risen from the surface of the sun; so now we wait
on meteors or asteroids, veering from dangerous safety to safe
danger, a distance few or fewer, but then the danger's real,
safety's not, that's the truth of it as it falls disturbed and 
scattered to the floor where one might imagine grounds defined
as metaphysics or whatever until the text chars, explodes,
implodes - "it's as if there's nothing to read, nothing to see,"
say the aliens - now we can move them from say siberia or
area fifty-one all the way to our interior - there are scripts
within scripts, encrypted scripts, lost-treasure-scripts, 
scripts-of-ghosts-and-demons, scripts-of-discontinuities,
kabbalistic numbers prying open numb alien skulls and thought-
forms, "Oh, how she could go on, in the mornings when the sun
was just rising behind the poplars in the garden." 

"The truth is, she did go on, she went on alone and speaking, 
murmuring the pulse of the green-gold world, and there was
nothing else to it, nothing else to any of it, nothing, nothing
at all."
