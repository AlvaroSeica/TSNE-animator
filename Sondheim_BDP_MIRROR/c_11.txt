Oracle, Prophecy, Heterogeneity, Writing





In searching through the two volumes of Pritchard's The Ancient Near East,

An Anthology of Texts and Pictures, for prophetic literature, I stumbled

across the "Akkadian Observations on Life," A Pessimistic Dialogue between

Master and Servant, trans. Pfeiffer, some of which bears quoting, particu-

larly in relation to writing, prophecy, and space: 



`(I) ["Servant,] obey me." Yes, my lord, yes. ["Bring me at once the] 

chariot, hitch it up. I will ride to the palace." [Ride, my lord, ride! 

All your wishes] will be realized for you. The [king] will be gracious to 

you. ["No, servant,] I shall not ride [to] the palace." [Do not ride], my 

lord, do not ride. [To a place...] he will send you. [_In a land which_] 

you know [not] he will let you be captured. [Day and] night he will let 

you see trouble.'



`(V)... "I will not build a house." You will not build it.'



`(VII) "Servant, obey me." Yes, my lord, yes. "I intend to start a 

rebellion." Do (it), my lord, [do (it)]. If you do not start a rebellion 

what becomes of your clay? Who will give you (something) to fill your 

stomach? "No, servant, I shall not do something violent." [Do (it) not, 

my lord, do (it) not.] The man, doing something violent is killed or 

[_ill-treated_], or he is maimed, or captured, or cast into prison.



(VIII) "Servant, obey me." Yes, my lord yes. "A woman will I love." Yes, 

love, my lord, love. The man who loves a woman forgets pain and trouble. 

"No, servant, a woman I shall not love." [Do not love,] my lord, do not 

[love]. Woman is a well, woman is an iron dagger - a sharp one! - which 

cuts a man's neck.



(IX) "Servant, obey me." Yes, my lord, yes. "Bring me at once water for 

my hands, and give it to me; i will offer a sacrifice to my god." Offer, 

my lord, offer. A man offering sacrifice to his god is happy, loan upon 

loan he makes. "No, servant, a sacrifice to my god will I not offer." Do 

not offer (it), my lord, do not offer (it). You may teach a god to trot 

after you like a dog when he requires of you, (saying), "Celebrate) my 

ritual" or "do not inquire (by requesting an oracle)" or anything else.'



`(XI) "Servant, obey me." Yes, my lord, yes. "I will do something helpful

for my country." Do (it), my lord, do (it). The man who does something

helpful for his country, - his helpful deed is placed in the bowl of

Marduk. "No, servant, I will not do something helpful for my country." Do

it not, my lord, do it not. Climb the mounds of ancient ruins and walk

about: look at the skulls of late and early (men); who (among them) is an

evildoer, who a public benefactor? 



(XII) "Servant, obey me." Yes, my lord, yes. "Now, what is good? To break

my neck, your neck, throw (both) into the river - (that) is good." Who is

tall enough to ascend to heaven? Who is broad enough to embrace the

earth?" "No, servant, I shall kill you and send you ahead of me." (Then)

would my lord (wish to) live even three days after me? (Colophon) Written

according to the original and collated.'



(2334-2279 b.c.e.)
