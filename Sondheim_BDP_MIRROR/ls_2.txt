Followup to Mez - 


but really, don't you feel we're clumsy? we're all clumsy, struggling
around, crawling in the muck. we need a century, another century, another
millennium. I'm appalled at our ignorance, all of ours -

and these forms of communication are hopeless, limited bandwidth - the
best flash moves clumsier than the worse movie; we're still working things
out, we may never get there, it may be centuries, five years -

this is the worst time to be alive, just the stuttered beginnings of
things, we'll never see fruition, and no, I don't think it's always been
this way -

just look at the net, at these machines! they're slow, painful, complex,
they can't speak, can't see, can't hear!

WE NEED TIME!
