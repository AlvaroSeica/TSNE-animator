from Lafayette, Indiana, to Omaha, Nebraska


mesmeric
iowa incipient small canyons erosions
through thickened grass illinois then the birds
moving in dark swarms one filled half the sky indiana
with complex topologies rounded formations similar to 
klein bottles and other lassoed phenomena
while small fires by the roadside were dense and clouded
swollen breast-lands beneath emptied wetlands sky such a natural
spread among internal organs knowing that from this
I would never have suspected clouds or any weather only hardness
accompanying what could be done there in the hills while against these
you might once again imagine the memory of flocks of small black birds
forgetting the canyons or the thickened grass nebraska because
those birds spelled "virtual language" the first time
while I imagined swelling breasts forgetting who they belonged to
or me for 'that matter'
