The Ghost





The ghost comes down to haunt the woods by means of a lantern. The 

ghost is always blue against a darker blue or black and the lantern

is a paper lantern held together with thin strips of wood and yellow

casting a darker yellow or black light, these things intermixed in a

manner of which I cannot speak. It's as if the ghost wore itself out

defining its edges, as if the edges caught on brambles and other

plants, stumbling around in the dark. It's as if the ghost puffed 

itself up with pride and desire in the middle of the air, barely

visible, caught literally by the edge of the eye struggling to attain

the self and its perfection during the nights of warmth and fireflies.

Stars which are unaccustomed to speak their place murmur among them-

selves when the ghost appears. 



And when the ghost appears, the brook flows more quietly, this flow

of eternity, of slim silver shapes lost among the pebbles of Hokusai.

For the ghost haunts the bridges in this region, their old wooden

railings a delight for floating in and out amidst the timbers, catch-

ing the solitary monk hurrying his way along in the darkness. The monk

knows the ghost and all the names of the ghosts, but the monk cannot

tell one ghost from another. They are all wraiths, surrounded by a 

yearning, not for life, but for some small semblance of solidity in 

the realm of the lanterns and fireflies. So the monk knows and speaks

as well to all the ghosts, and knows and speaks to none of them, this

monk in his dark robe with his thick belt, carrying a tiny bell.
