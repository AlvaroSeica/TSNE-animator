THE GENERATIONS OF CATS





during my lifetime collapsed into a sea of debris, the cat I accompany

garnered several generations, back into the early 19th century at the

very least, pre-atomic bomb, holocaust, television and radio; she 

appears here, pure organism, unable to cite ancestor, date or place,

carrying the culture of solitude, raised early on in anonymity. the cat

is never a witness, silenced or otherwise; outside the symbolic, within

the indexical, s/he moves from trajectory to trajectory of reconstruc-

tion.



the cat is a confused race, conflating instinct with human transmissions

against the presence of computer, lightbulb, television and telephone.

the rest is typical environment - but illumination, mobility, sourceless

sound, are something else. so the cat has lived for thousands of years

since the employment of fire, a confused creature, whose culture itself

is that of confusion, whose confusion is a becoming of interpretation,

whose interpretation is that of the human itself. from the cat, we learn

the materiality of the human.



the cat and I cannot figure anything out with a dispassionate air. her

relatives are non-existent, in an uncanny space. the opposite of cyber-

mind, she combines the obdurate with communication: meowing, worlds

turn. if we are losers, carrying the weight of the symbolic, the cat

reminds us of the sentient mobility of the real, the margins of taxon-

omy, and the absence, absolute, of history itself.



(the cat, at home, reminds us we never are, at home.)
