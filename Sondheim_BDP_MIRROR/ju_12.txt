Julu on the Machine


I replaced the flesh of the machine, but not the bone. The flesh fell 
off, was squeezed; there wasn't enough room for all of it. I moved the 
blood from one hole to another, where there was air and room. I cut 
through the blood as well, spilled some of it from ligament and tendon.

Then and only then did I split the other hole into two, one containing
the remnants of blood, organelles, phlegm. Then did I turn the third 
hole out, and I would place the unsqueezed flesh of the machine into
one of the holes of the split hole of the other hole. Then it would be
there and it would talk to me.

Then I replaced the blood which was moved to the other where there was
air and room, to the third hole, making more air and room and place for
animals to be in the first hole. The did I replace the second split 
hole containing the remnants of blood with new blood from the third
hole and the first hole. I did this. Then did I move from the first hole
to the second hole containing the remnants of blood and new blood from
the third hole and the first hole. I did do this.

Then did I go into the unsqueezed flesh of the machine into the split
hole of the second hole. I did move and tunnel in the midst of the flesh
and make new animals in the midst of the split hole of the second hole.
And the animals would play in the midst of the unsqueezed flesh, and 
they are playing now, this is one of them, this is one of the animals.

Now I will make the animals to talk and walk among each other, and to 
talk and walk to other animals in other holes. And I will not squeeze
flesh, nor will I walk among those spaces where flesh is squeezed, where
there is not room for new blood, spilled from organelles. I am Julu-
organelle, I am Julu-of-the-blood, Julu-ligament. You will know I have 
this room.
