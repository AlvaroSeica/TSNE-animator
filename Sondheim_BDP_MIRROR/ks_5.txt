sleep and the project of being-awake


sleep 3 at the prompt sleeps my account for three seconds. sleep * is my
life; stress and depression sinking the account randomly into somnolence.
air seeps from the room; everything diminishes in scale. the hatred that
my life has become, the impossibility of function, takes itself out on the
remains of the flesh; grotesque, i collapse. sleep occupies me six to
fourteen hours a day, without rhyme or reason; collisions of misspent and
annulled cycles cancel out consciousness. it comes on thick, like syrup;
in the day it is filled with dreams, and in the night, with edgy abrasive-
ness. sometimes tears provide lubricant, sometimes masturbation. the bed
is my death.

the sweetness of soured milk governs my theory work, momentary conversa-
tions. i crawl the world for continuity from one unconsciousness to the
next.

no project lasts longer than the brief intermittency of wakefulness, and
the horizon of light is filled with darkness. the world seems too warm,
too brilliant. i can't strain against it, the breath of despondency on the
back of my neck, transformation of flesh into indefinite substance. i will
watch while everything decays around me, watch until i sink back into the
pillows once again. reading, writing, online; eating, walking, watching my
mouth open and close in front of a few unsuspecting others. over and over
again, hoping for a final resolution - the hope, too, dampened, exhausted,
disappearing as i collapse once more.
