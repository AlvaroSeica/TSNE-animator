Core Cored

The thick core is cored, tangled strands appear and disappear,
generally I avoid the blurred chaos at work here; here, they're
celebrated, embraced; the notes are there; in 1, the long-
necked saz door is shut; in 2, the door is open, the bass moves
forward; in both the weaving of a rope useful for a suspension
or bridge; as if the core were cored, swallowed; music goes
down into spatial striations, thick time; Surge sound, model of
future life; an engine; engine without substance; imaginary
engine of the future perfect; the core cored; the Down.



Surge

"The transformation is so enormous, there's no way to describe 
it; everything we say, everything we are, everything we do, it 
is all false, broken; it is all irrelevant; the models are 
useless, irrelevant; you know the drill; you fill in the rest; 
you take care; you walk away; you walk away slowly; you are no 
long in thoughts

transvaluation of all values, annihilation of transvaluation =
tattered disappearances = timed-out

Transvaluation of all values, thonged, timed-out. Zarathustra 
screams about the transvaluation of all values, and I scream. 
The first to go is the transvaluation of all values. A chucked 
value is valueless even if it is a transvaluation. No, wait! A 
chucked transvaluation is worth a lot of the little ones. My 
values are my clothes! I chuck them and dress in transvalua- 
tions. There are never simultaneous things in my world of 
transvaluations. That's part of my transvaluation which does the 
chucking for me. No value-chucking for my transvaluation! It 
will have to go! Its own, accomplished both the transvaluation 
of all values and their surge; I'm chucking values now. The 
first to go is the transvaluation of transvaluations. Everyone 
knows me here and understands me daily. What's that? Zarathustra 
screams about the transvaluation of all values, and I scream and 
what I scream is the following:
