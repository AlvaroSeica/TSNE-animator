(Why you haven't heard from Travis in a while.)


Travis had made a nice world. There were animals and plants and ground-
things. Jennifer smashed it. Tiny gasps of breath could be heard from the
animals. The plants didn't make a sound. Jennifer jumped up and down, her
frock bouncing in the air. Her frock had oxygen under it.

Later that evening, Travis took the vows. Everywhere he saw tiny legs qui-
vering in the air. The plants had developed brown patches. Jennifer was
not sorry to see him go. The big black carriage weaved back and forth as
it was pulled out of the driveway. The sorrels knew something was afoot.
They never returned to Aberdeen.

Jennifer wondered if "cleaning up after herself" meant at all or nearly
the same thing as "cleaning up before herself." She stared down at her lap
for a while, leaped up and ran the house. She'll be back later, Tiffany.
You can wait in the living room if you want.
