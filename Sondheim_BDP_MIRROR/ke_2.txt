I'm calling you a fraud -


This is pathetic. All you do now is change text around, insert and delete,
make hobgoblins where there weren't any, drag your fetish-ghosts across
the screen, pretending they're real. What can I say, how sick you are. You
go in on IRC and pretend to be Alan_S or Nikuko or some such and flood the
place or act the innocent or offer pussy, as if you even knew what that
was. You're a fraud; you use cleverness in lieu of thinking, and you take
care to cover up your traces, not develop them. Even this note is a sub-
terfuge, on the level of sophomoric writing, do you understand? There's
nothing to it. You're covering again. For all I know, you'll sign this
"Jennifer" as if that made a difference. You haven't read half the things
you claim to have read. You quote because you just can't think. If you
could think you'd stand on your own. You borrow from everyone else. I'd
hate you but then everyone would think it's self-hatred; I'd love you, but
then everyone would think it's love...

Jennifer
