Ritual


Over a hundred times I've had to follow the paths below, adding new files
to the Internet Text as they _accumulate,_ transform into theoretical sub-
stance. Last night, file ff was added to the rest, and the net index was
updated. The files are easily retrievable; the whole morass is around
four megabytes of solid bristly ascii. 

I travel from panix.com to the site at jefferson.village.virginia.edu, and
then: 

341	cd ftp.archives/cybermind-digest.archive/internet
342	ftp panix3.panix.com	[getting file]
343	wc ff				
344	ls -l ee		[checking permissions]
345	chmod 664 ff		
346	ls -l ff		[changing, checking permissions]
347	cd
348	cd public_html
349	pico internet_txt.html	[adding access on home-page for filename]
350	ftp panix3.panix.com	[preparing home-page for download]
351	exit
352	cd ftp.archives/cybermind-digest.archive/internet
353	ls -l netindex.txt
354	rm netindex.txt		[removing old index for Internet Text]
355	ftp panix3.panix.com	[adding new index]
356	chmod 664 netindex.txt
357	ls -l netindex.txt	[checking permissions]

I exit, enter internet_txt.html from panix.com, make sure everything is
running properly. I have had to change the netindex.txt first, by down-
loading ff, and toggling between it and online. The index has grown to
390 entries, something for everybody. It's spidery, out of control; it 
has bones in it. The sequence above, server-side, is the bi-weekly stir-
ring of the soup.
