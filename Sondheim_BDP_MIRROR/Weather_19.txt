None


You don't know who I am, do you? Do you know what I tell you, what I say?
Have you ever seen me? After all my texts on virtuality, after all my
analyses, you still don't get it, do you? It hasn't even occurred to you,
for example - it hasn't crossed your mind. 

Would that it were "Alan," would that it were "Clara." Would that it were
a circulation or confabulation, simulacrum or imaginary. But would that it
were "Alan" or "Clara" for you, would that you would have learned some-
thing by now. But you don't know me, you don't even know of me, and so you
don't get it, do you?

There is less and less to say as there is less and less of a return. How
could you return or return to me when you're clueless, when you're on the
wrong track, when the trail is cold, if there ever were one? You wouldn't
know that much, you wouldn't know anything, not knowing me, not knowing,
after all this time, _just who exactly I am._
