"Starlight asked Non-entity, saying, 'Master, do you exist? Or do you not
exist? He got no answer to his question, however, and looked stedfastly to
the appearance of the other, which was that of a deep void. All day long
he looked to it, but could see nothing; he listened for it, but could hear
nothing; he clutched at it, but got hold of nothing. Starlight then said,
'Perfect! Who can attain to this? I can (conceive the ideas of) existence
and non-existence, but I cannot (conceive the ideas of) non-existing non-
existence, and still there be a non-existing existence. How is it possible
to reach to this?'" (Chuang Tzu, Legge)
