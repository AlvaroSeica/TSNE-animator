	Pre-MOO 1990

	the stream spoke.
	what did it say, what did it say?
	Margaret has come to play.
	trees bent blood back down to root.
	dawn came and went. then night
	cried out the blind black dust of sight.
	void filled. branches overturned
	branches stuttered dead and echoed forth.
	sound came from the north
	and hurtled south, along the axis
	of the earth. the flowers thrust, burst
	in thought, then language first
	retrieved your name. I ran towards you.
	in rhyme the sky turned blue.
