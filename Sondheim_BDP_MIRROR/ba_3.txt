aenunciation

each movement carries
sensors to awaken the movement
with decrees and inscriptions
portending annunciation
in the order in which
each movement is given 
to the others among the others
carrying with it such moments
as the sensors recorded
in the history of such moments
entering the portal called "the next"

through the memory of portal
through the memory of movement
and sensors with no memory 
of sensors and their murmuring
and ordering which is sign
of every annunciation
 
annunciation of every sign
