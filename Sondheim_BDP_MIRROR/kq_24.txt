Last Letter from Gol.Com


I'm out of gol.com, my Japanese account. I closed it down a week early.
Although they have touted themselves as far ahead of panix in my corres-
pondence with them, they have repeatedly damaged their own shell accounts.
They switched machines without telling anyone at times - rendering void
email lists which rely on correct addressing. They got rid of emacs quite
a while ago, allow no traceroute, ping, netstat, or any sort of perl and
other programming - as far as I could tell, only simple shell programs
would run. They change things without advance notice - including time-
consuming machine repairs that they knew of in advance. I'd dial in and
find the account inaccessible. At one point, they removed Pine - I had to
switch to elm; they removed elm - I had to switch to mail. All this with-
out notice. Of course they removed /usr/games etc. Finally, they kept
reconfiguring Pine, the mailer - at this point, I couldn't even change my
name. They set more and more of the so-called user options. And again, all
of this without advance warning.

Thank god for panix.com - I'd recommend it anywhere. The following indi-
cates my account after I took out all files, incriminating or otherwise!
It was down to 110 k.

I'm writing this last letter from gol.com. I've closed the account down. I
have nothing more open here. They are furious trolls here at gol.com. They
have rendered shell accounts useless. They are evil people. They should be
turned inside out.
