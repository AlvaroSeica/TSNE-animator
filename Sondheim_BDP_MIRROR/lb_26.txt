The Three Most Important Sentences, Why the Third is the Most Important


Karl Kraus, Nachts, Wien-Leipzig, Verlag Die Fackel, 1924, p 43:

     "Das alte Wort gehoert allen. Keiner kann es nehmen.
                               *
      Am Ursprung gibts kein Plagiat."

and it is the resonance of this third sentence, at the origin there is no
plagiarism, in combination with the first and second

just as the first and second may produce the third

that I misinterpreted through (in relation to) a glowering deconstruction:

     "Am Ursprung gibts Plagiat."

plagiarism there from the beginning, always already, the potential for
equivalence gnawing away at identity, the slipping of the signifier,
slipping of one text into another, always already the duplication, the
digital exchange, frisson-jouissance, almost at the lip, the edge

that I have placed at the core of my writing, that has therefore disassem-
bled the core, always already trembling

so that Karl has the A of Schelling's identity, here I am, misread such as
equivalence - there's no type, no standard,

general principal of _typification,_ that is methodological processes,
protocols - 

Karl has standards, that's why I like him

( I _admire_ him, imitate-duplicate, Am Ursprung gibts Plagiat; which is
the general principle of the _avatar_ )
