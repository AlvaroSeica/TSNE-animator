PALMTOP NESTLED IN THE COMFORT OF MY HAND



1.

Maybe theory often proves its way.

With hard science, I shall improve my cause.

Casuistry still rules by light of day,

But night shall warrant truth within its claws.

The reason?

That the symbol knows no season.

The symbol brings the world within dark clasp;

Black sign against black time is all we grasp.

The `lineaments of gratified desire'

Play to a cold, invisible black fire.

No letters white are seen

Against the dark machine

That loses, forms symbolic forms for hire.

2. 

That about does it. Even the economy of the sign appears in the last

line. Symbols dark against dark? Certainly: eliminate the body of the

sign. Letters white? The legend of the Torah plays a role here.

3. 

I keep looking for _that_ book, _that_ symbol that constructs suture.

On _that,_ worlds run and worlds collapse. The wound remains.

_Internal vs. Projected Space:_

[

The _other_ location is the domain of the body itself, its extensions,

what exists within its field of grasp. The _palmtop_ is a step towards

the introjection and darkening of the symbolic.

What _penetrates_ the domain of the body caresses and attacks; body

responds through defensive/reaction mechanisms.

I devour you when you come to me.

_Negation_ is at the heart of communication. You come to me: I defend,

penetrate, am penetrated. The body _physically_ couples within reach.

[

Cyberspace is always already other, incapable of physical negation;

what occurs is always images burned within the eyelids. Everything and

nothing invades. _Palmtop_ curls the body around the symbolic. Typing

at the desk, symbolic leers: I look ahead, slightly up, towards the 

screen, the horizon of projected space.
