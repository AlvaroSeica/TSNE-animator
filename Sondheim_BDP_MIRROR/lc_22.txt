I have a technical question, Clar says. The older technology, no longer
working , leads me to wonder about the newer, what might be the case with
Mp3 as an example of my speech to you , not wanting to download this
speech, wanting its presence on the Webpage, so that my voice comes forth
from the screen , where nothing is, nothing was, nothing will be, these
blank spaces , these moments, but no matter, given the streaming nature of
the Thing, it seems an impossibility, nothing appears but loss , so that
the words aren't heard, the playback applications don't open, new and old
Clar are silent as always this is the wonder, these shorn dipoles, these
misalignments of the iron*, derailing subtlely beneath the surface, first
and last gasp of Clar**, wanting you to hear my voice*** Sat Sep 11 01:49-
:33 EDT 1999****

*, useless bits and bytes dissolved or returned to magnetic chaos, 
**first and last moment when the eyes briefly are held in your
imagination, this gift from me , wanting to speak to you

****Perhaps the words came from the "other" who speaks through new and old
Clar? Clar doesn't know, works with the tech, its skin: There are so many
Organisms of Pleasure! Clar wants to organize the Iron (magnetic domains)
in some Fashion or Fastening of Speech, since Fashion is a Fastening. 

"Then listening to Clar, you'll too, be listening two Clar, old and new."
