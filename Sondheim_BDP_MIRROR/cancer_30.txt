dear whom,

+++ what is it you wish to know. last night there were burrowings,
them I hope you understand. the great sky were an enormous jelly
of one piece. so distinct i hear A great soul has come through
this sky. +++ i did not see through there, i did not further went. 
what would be this that the very walls shudder, i did not have 
premonitions. in the morning i listen to a star i cannot see in
our bright day. +++ i did see nothing. +++ 'i am a radio waiting
for a station' my father did say. the sun was very bright day and
perhaps that were a reason. i do not know. i hear A great music in
my soul. i will study god. we +++
