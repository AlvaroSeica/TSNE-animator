Third Sex 4  (Nursery Rhyme for Clara Hielo on Unix/talk)





If you give me your name, 

I can't write the same;

No one is to blame, 

If you give me your name.



I write from the air,

I place my words there

Above the fine line;

I can't help but stare.



I would make you mine,

Your body is bare

Below the fine line

I know what you wear.



I know what you say,

What you tell me is true;

This isn't a play -

I know about you.



My name is your own,

Your flesh is mine;

My flesh to the bone

Is cast as your own.



My legs are splayed wide,

I moan and I whine;

Upon me you ride, 

Come in me inside.



Your legs are splayed wide,

You moan and you whine;

Upon you I ride,

Come in you inside.



If I give you my name,

You'll have me forever.

But marrow from bones

Almost never will sever.



If you give me your name,

I'll always be true

Through flood and through flame,

The flesh runs to you.



Our blood is the same,

Your flesh runs to me.

If you give me your name,

I'm burned with the same.



_If you give me your name,

I'm burned with your name._
