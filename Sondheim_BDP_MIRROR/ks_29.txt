fragment of continuing thinking.

we are you through any identity, any equivalence. we will say our iden-
tity through you and we will tighten our group and move our horses in 
through the sacrificial circle. there will be kings and queens. there
will be avatars and fires. we will move in and towards a point or mom-
ent of condensation, we will call this the eye and give it our name
king or whomsoever would have a queen to lead this eye further and nor-
mal i. i would always remember us but we would no longer be able to 
speak we or i, we would no longer be able to speak. this is the orig-
inary sin among some others, and incarnations among others. the horse
before it is cut down has lain with the queen, you may read it in our
records. we are a very ancient people. we have descended from the 
mountains to the valley, condensation towards our i. one with the eye
and two with the eye. there will be more to see and remember whom we
will see and remember. we are among ourselves. we who are writing this
will be forgotten, replaced with that i. you will always find it where
writing is transmission, where the horse is no longer of the telling,
but of the naming. still, we will borrow identities back beyond where
you are you, and we will be there, placing ourselves within so many 
clothes.
