*A branching direction takes us to top-fuel nitro dragsters at 306 mph,
engine burning for a lifespan of six minutes total, already innumerable
races, tests, as the quartermile's around five seconds. Hill and Bern-
stein are still my favorites on the circuit - finesse. I'd grant them a
Pentium any day, but they're probably running 886s before Intel's got
them made made made.
