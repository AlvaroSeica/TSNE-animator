Theoretical Work in the Internet Text (Locations)


Everthing I write must be read with this doubled meaning:
0. Clara Hielo Internet.
avatar of the uncanny scattered throughout her text
1. Concepts of address, protocol, recognition: the tuning of subjectivity,
instrumental reason.
from the very beginnings of the Internet Text, these terms focused upon
the entrancing and frameworks of cyberspace, first files
2. Rewrite and the opening of the space of the I: inscription and fissure.
nearly the very beginnings, inscribing which continues and thins throughout
the other texts, the alphabetic as well
3. Emission, spew, and sourceless/targetless communications.
focused upon well early enough, presencing of speaking without author or
text through until and beyond the end
4. Hysterical embodiment and the variants of reading the other.
third sexualities located from the middle of the Net files on, centered in
the alphabetic texts
5. Synesthesia and the transformations of senses across the Net.
substratum everywhere in the Net and alphabetic texts, discomforts of the
body against the particulation of the symbolic, stuttering of packets
6. Defuge, burnouts and anomies on the Net.
recently, and harbored primarily within the alphabetic, wandering against
theory which refuses the function of the suture or I.
7. Third sex and the ascii unconscious.
beginning early on, circulations, and stuttering, Tiffay, Travis, others,
narratologies as well, recent focus within the alphabetic texts.
8. The uncanny/imaginary, fantasms, and the reading/jectivity of the other.
increasingly relying on borderline states, what could only be imagined in
the Net files, descending into the substance of the imaginary in the more
recent work.
9. Communities and communalities on the Net.
mid-sections coming together with false promises, premises, delusions, the
largest middle-third of the work harboring occasional files.
10. Disruptions of community and self, web inversion and power.
conflagrations and violent outbreaks, deaths and dissolutions, from the
mid-early Net texts on to the present.
11. Liquidities of identity, identity shifting, shape-riding.
Travis and others occupying the final science fiction stories going nowhere.
12. Appearances of cybermind elsewhere in literary/philosophical texts.
intensity of recent investigations in which the textual body and the body 
of texts simultaneously presence the curlicue on the margins, almost
afterthoughts.
13. The phenomenology of the architecture of the Net TCP/IP itself.
running through the fourth and fifth sevenths of the total work, concerns
about Net sentience and the clean and proper bodies of the datagrams.
14. The chora/maternal: towards the symbolic, murmur/stutter of the world.
more recently, emerging with emergence, the convolutions of a text breaking
in upon itself, the splintering and stuttering of the teeth and tongue.
15. The presymbolic as an interpretation or regression from the symbolic.
everywhere in the more recent work, where text devolves into non-text,
where politics begin with the word and endlessly end off-screen.
16. Addictions, censorships, obscenities, and other topical issues.
addictions always already from the endings of the first few files, but the
obscene a continuous return, aware of the politics "beginning with the 
word."
17. Death on and off the Net, the physical body as obdurate and/or residue.
from several files in, real and imaginary deaths, the deaths of texts and
spaces later and later on.
18. Virtual or veiled subjectivity, phenomenology and psychoanalytics.
all the way through the Net files and alphabetic texts, the subject 
approached and withdrawn, introjections and projections merging into the
wares of the terminally-screened.
19. Detemporalizations and the problematic of time in the virtual subject.
recent thinkings towards the center of the alphabetic texts, the last few,
destabilizations, the beyond of the earlier Net files, groping towards a
theoretical resolution.
20. Generalized mesaure geometries and dissipative communications.
the computer-program texts in the Net files, concentrating in particular on
the series fgfffgfgfgfffgfffgfffgfgfgfffgfg... and its relation to the lost
almost-symmetries of Net exchanges.
21. Phenomenology of emotional states, behaviors, and discourses on the Net.
everywhere beneath and upon the surface of the files.
23. Source and phenomenologies of the voice, mouth, organs.
everywhere beneath and upon the surface of the files, breaking-out in the
midst of the other, narratological descents.
24. Phenomenology of cyberspace, of its "inhabiting."
everywhere again within and without the totality of texts and files.
25. Looping, blackholes, the blind password, the 'great beyond.'
in the earlier works, and in the middle seventh, reoccurring losses in the
occasion of the framework itself and those farsighted enough to delimit
the absent boundaries of these multiply-closed multiple topologies.
26. Events in cyberspace: wars, peace, origins, dissolutions.
irruptions when they occur; they manifest themselves as tears in the fabric
of the hole, which is sutured upon them; a certain hollowness pervades.
27. Part-objects, entities, proper-names, and totalizations in cyberspace.
the fourth and fifth seventh moving through the name in relation to the
earliest accounts in the Net files of the same.
28. The granularity of the real.
the first three-sevenths of the Net text and alphabetic files, carrying the
memory of its beginning, the initial post, the surrounding terminal screen,
the dawn of the night and dusk of the relative day.
29. Relationships of the above to everyday life, philosophy and sociology.
drawn forth in a process of withdrawing, throughout the textual domain.
