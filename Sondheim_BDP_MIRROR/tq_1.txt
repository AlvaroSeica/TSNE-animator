from the cathedral

fallowed birches hallowed while life is never hallowed
life is never hallowed, signs are born from sorrow,
foaming ride on the surface, unfolding hallowed shallows,
something in the depths, something hardened, hallowed,

we consider hallowed. est chanting of the earth resonates 
hallowed in the farther/est reaches of to the anode; the vacuum 
life is a hallowed-hollowed life. In groping the sky, silent 
burial in hallowed ground life is never hallowed. signs are born 
from sorrow. something far below, is it something hallowed by 
tradition and violent trailing down from mangrove, wounded 
dragonfly carried to safe repeating sometime when thy are very 
happy on th othr repeating on halloween but sometime when thy 
are very happy on th othr trailing down from mangrove, wounded 
halloween dragonfly carried to safe trailing down from mangrove, 
cavern of hallowed twisty passages, churinga markings - heading 
there, the S was lost or hallowed ground life is never hallowed, 
signs are born from sorrow, foaming ride on the surface, 
unfolding hallowed shallows, something in the depths, something 
hardened, hallowed,

Chanterelle, I come up empty. This is about the empty and the 
fool. This is a glance to the left opens up empty screen on the 
left, the message search for ide devices and coming up empty 
empty. so the machine so far turned up empty. more outlining on 
a talk about net-sex coming up empty - embodiment that keep 
coming up empty. But the ghost-in-the-machine, the uncanny two 
of them witnessing the monster coming up empty in their midst, 
these weirdly point to another, you see, one point or another, 
but a, and this text could - brakes give out no nothing eighteen 
wheels coming up empty fast viral display, something "coming up 
empty" as if uncalled for - ah, i can see escape and keep coming 
up against artificial barriers of the edge of and you, you can't 
get enough of a good thing when you don't get enough - more 
tests and sleep clinic coming up empty, already had xrays and 
overly simplistic, running empty against that same wall, that 
gap that refuses to admit there's something rather than nothing 
- I can't change much, Julu Twine says, I desired a haunting- 
screen, coming up empty against the creases of my body, the 
_tattered notes_ and white pointy flowers coming up empty thru 
the hills, i am arm, robotic. lapping at the stern and she was 
worried about the message, ''I'll murder you,'' Wagner said. 
``You have no idea what's coming.'' a viral display, something 
"coming up empty" as if uncalled for - ah, i can see character/s 
try to escape running into artificial barriers enough - more 
tests and sleep clinic coming up empty, already had xrays and I 
liked the dance so much I kept the recording: "embodiment, the 
ghost-in-the-machine, the uncanny"! Chanterelle, I came up 
empty!

weaves, interpenetrates, but desire is an other. 
the face is an other, face is always an other,

a space which will become other. This is an other space; you

i'll die it will be somewhere else - that's the i that is an

clashing civilization that open up spaces beyond thematic
villages, gravitational lensing, alignments, territories
inherently out-of-tune, microbial landscapes, slime-mold
movements, emergences, emergencies

no overdubbing, extrusion: guzheng, intrusion: qin qin guzheng

theories of unthemed dwellings, nomadic commons, taz, 
coming together and falling apart, falling apart and coming
together, defeat of the punctum-turret, alignments of 
universal skies



As if it were Robert Morris'

http://www.alansondheim.org/clicks.png

and the box w/ the sounds of its own making, whereas in this 
case, registration of computer clicks producing the image 
measuring the registration or the image registering the 
production of its (digital, imaginary) needle sway or spectral 
imaginary of the registration of computer clicks; since the 
digital is always conceptual, always conceived along code and 
protocol lines; realize that it's easy to produce _conceptual 
traps_ of this sort, rather than otherwise, and that such traps 
in fact constitute the very nature of art and its mappings 
within the framework or aegis of the digital; all that remains 
to be done here is to acknowledge the entities that produced the 
(linux) operating system and its (now and current) attendant 
apps; so it's as if it were Robert Morris but without the labor, 
the physicality of the world, which has been replaced by the 
coupling of finger-strokes within the closed apparatus of the 
computer, just as the Morris box, if I remember correctly, was 
constituted by a taped recording within it, the sounds evident 
through a speaker, to one and all, the audience within a gallery 
somewhere on a street in a city in the world, people milling 
about, wars, holocausts, nations, in the midst of what would be, 
at best, a relatively quiet sound, a moment away, within, of 
silence, even, something thought, something dwelling, among 
you, something _there._ *

* but among the slaughters as well, the sounds of their own 
making as well, and just as well
