F. Avatar dispersions as social media.
Mocap Transformations

1. DISPERSED BODY: Sensors are dispersed among 2-3 people, who move 
slowly apart / perform, as much as possible.*

Inversions: 
Graceful avatar for live choreography
Live choreography for coagulated avatar.

1a. Movements are 'linear' - performers slowly moving apart or 
together (occluding).
1b. Movements are 'tensor' - performers bend slowly, creating internal 
body 'twists' (center external to skeleton).
1c. Movements are 'contractive' or 'expansive' - performers open up or
contract in relation to each other.
1d. Movements are 'rotational' - performers slowly rotate / twist 
(center internal to skeleton).

2. SINGULAR BODY: Sensors on one performer.*

2a. Body curls in on itself as much as possible.
2b. Body twists as much as possible.

3. MAPPING: Sensors are 'mapped' according to various transformations
on the body.*

3a. Sensors are positioned 'inwardly' or 'outwardly' on the body.
3b. The body is twisted so that the sensor positions appear normal;
the body is then untwisted.

4. ENTWINED BODIES: Similar to 1, but with bodies entwined during

initial mapping.*
5. FLIGHT SENSING: Any and all of the above, mapping - if possible -
in flight. (This would allow, for example, for a 'normal' mapping 
with a horizontal or upside-down body.)*

*All of these would be performed as 'near' as possible to the 
breaking-point, where the sensor reading breaks down.

Movement:

Movement _for the most part_ would be reasonably graceful, and
relatively slow. The dance/performance will appear to occur _within_
the body as much as possible - the body turning into otherwise
inconceivable positions.

I would also like to try out ideas related to the 'tumbling' body 
(random positioning) with the flight harness, as well as the 'avatar'
body; I can demo these on video.
