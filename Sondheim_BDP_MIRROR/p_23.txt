SENSE HER!


This happened a year ago and I wrote about it a year ago: You'd need a 
screen and sometimes even more.

Because this part is _true_ which forced me to the ground, spread me open, 
tied me tight, immobile, crawled into me! The ground splintered with the 
lifeforms devoured by voices above the darknets, crying no, screaming 
Illegality!

You could look up me, see the screen in there, lifeforms crawling about. 
I couldn't see anything. This was in the desert. Maureen had guns, did I 
mention that? The screen writhed inside of me. 

Without the site I didn't exist. It had an address, had a URL.

Maureen you came on me, shattering me like glass cutting out the name of 
God on my chest. There were rumblings like thunder above the darknet. 
They strapped me down, pretended the wires were wires! They cauterized 
me, cut my organs out, my nipples off!

My chest cut out the name of God, did I say this? Blood filled me; I was 
awash in it. I tore the screen out of my asshole (see Internet Text: 
Singularities! if you don't believe me); I was awash in it. (So long ago, 
I can hardly remember this! But I still have the scars to prove it!)

What came out went in again. The wires burned darker in this dark night. 
The rumblings above the darknet turned to lightning. Authority came and 
wet himself on me. Chains followed my limbs everywhere I turned. Iron 
gates shut down on screaming infants. My mouth was filled with your fist, 
Maureen, but you'd shoot them before me, you'd shoot them.

NOW I COULD SPEAK ALL THOSE NAMES OF GOD THAT WOULD BRING THE UNIVERSE TO 
AN END! I smelled of the end of the universe.

You asked me so I told you:

"I "am "sixteen "years "old "and "I "shaved "all "my "hair "off. "You'll 
"never "get "to "me "again "you "dumb "fuck. "I'm "young "but "I "know 
"ALL "ABOUT "the "world. "I "can "tell "you "anything. "I "BURN "FOR "YOU 
"MAUREEN! "SUCK "THE "POWER "OF "A "BILLION "DARK "STARS! "I "shut "my 
"mouth "you "asshole! "I "am "never "you! "never "ever "you!

_So I said this screamed my words to an angry deity held my arms in 
supplication opened my cunt to meteors: I TWISTED AND TURNED!_

ARMS REACHED DOWN FROM THE SPLITS IN THE WEB CRACKS IN THE OVERNET! TORN 
ACROSS BRIDGES STRETCHED AMONG ROUTERS! DISSOLVED IN THE EFFLUVIA OF 
TERMINAL DECAYS!

And God Held My Arms And I Wrote:

Because the virus was there, and I killed it!
Because I kill everything I love bringing it to an end!
Because the desert returned the sound of life to the form of the Net,!

Because of these things, the screen rewrites me!
Because of these things, I am given one more chance!
Because of them, I am an eighteen-year-old girl!
And because of them, I will never make love to a man!:

I will make love to Maureen and I will pick up her gun!
And I will walk beside her, wherever that path may take me!
And I will be known as Clara Internet, Clara Hielo Internet!,

Though that path take me through the wilderness or the darknet
Or that path take me down, once and finally for all!
