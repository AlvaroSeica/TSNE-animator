The longing


"Now I-Phaedra shall rest!"

You ask: Where are we in this distant land?

"You are victims of my words!"

You say: We march against your words, against their meanings, 
responding only to their sounds.

"Surely you would have done the same!"

You say: We would have done whatever you required of us...

"Now I-Phaedra shall rest!"

You ask: Ah, and leave us to our own devices?

"...and its dominions thereof"

You say: As if devices had dominions, as if they moved across 
sequestered fields...

"You can't see me! I'm never around!"

You say: But floating nonetheless there, above the landscape 
ruptured by pain and history.

"Who the men were, how they were armed!"

You say: How they attacked, how they ruined Europe, Asia, 
America, Africa, Australia as well.

"Now I-Phaedra shall rest!"

You exclaim: I-Phaedra sleeps with well-deserved rest 
in the midst of chaos!

"Now I-Phaedra shall rest!"

You exclaim: Sleep then, insistent one!

"I-Phaedra who shall sing to you:"

You say: The lullaby of rest, of armed men gone to battle, 
of sequestered fields and ghosts haunting history...

"Wait! Wait!"

You ask: And for what, while America burns?

"Place your sword by my side and I will sing to you!"

You say: But song is not enough, arms and the woman, 
resistance and the harmony of caverns beneath our feet...

"A sheen over all the world, encompassing"

You exclaim: Gathering us together, returning us to belief 
in past and future times. Alas, how one belies the other!

"Wait, I have more to tell you!"

You say: We await your word and our listening.

"I-Phaedra!"

You exclaim: Ah, Phaedra!

"You are victims of my words!"

You say: Leaving you at last, quitting this bleak dominion, 
history no longer, words blinded by ineffable light...

"Wait! Wait!"

You say: Ah no, leaving you at last...

"You can't see me! I'm never around!"

You say: Ah, I-Phaedra, ah...

(exiting, always exiting...)
