later that night . in the early evening . shortly after the fog settled in
the valley . just before the sun rose burning in the west . in the heat of
the day . such a cool, limpid afternoon, not to mention a tired mid-morn-
ing date . just after going to bed, hypnagogic imagery on the way to
troubled sleep . howling in the wee hours of the morn . at noon, at high
noon . shortly before a late afternoon tea . morning babbling brook . a
bit earlier than she might have thought . if only one could release the
midday tension . that day . that night . just that afternoon . it must
have been sometime in the late evening, right before the rising of the
moon . one of those non-descript anonymous hours . much much later that
night . somewhat before the fog lifted in the valley . somewhat after the
sun set burning in the east .
