Stentar Caeruleus


Breath leaves a carpse, carrying anly
Final banes af wards always, and anly
Skein af blaad and entrails, anly
Wards ance wet with mauth's tangue, anly

Palisades crest apen, merely
Carry crests af signs, sa merely
Spaken by the dead mauths, merely
Mauth wards wet and distraught, merely

Anly carpse blanks death's trap, breath
Anly banes and wards are ever final,
Anly entrails snare life's skein,
Anly tangues mauth dead wet wards,

Merely crassing palisades,
Merely farming crests that carry,
Merely what was never spaken,
Merely tangue sharn fram the mauth,

Merry, lanely, brat's skin af swards
Tarry fusillades, gare braken shauts.
