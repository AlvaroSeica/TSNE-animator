SHAPE-RIDER





Shapelessness frightens us; we assign Form to the world, Landscape from

a point-of-view. Onlooker creates image and world reproduces within the 

elliptical trajectory of oozed language. 



As well, we give Form to Presence, Capitals concluding what had never

begun. Ghosts are drawn out of the oozed uncanny, their absence sublim-

ated by sheets and strange sounds lurking in the souls of things; pol-

tergeists appear through the universal domain of objects and emblems. 

What occurs _within_ circuitry is described as ontologically _bounded_ 

by circuitry - never mind that the sputtering is already a concretion 

of mathematics vectored and recursive. And the _binding_ forms a map; 

there is always a map _at hand,_ at the tip of one's fingers, the phys-

ical tracing and retracing the abstract itself.



The fragment always appears broken, in need of a body. Beings search for

the Matrix. Vision completes contours, constructs the full bandwidth of

color when spectography tells us otherwise. The ear gestures towards the 

singer, toward the bass end of abbreviated bandwidths. Oozing language 

names, renames, occludes itself in the process.



_Shape is our ontology_ as gas contained fulfills the borders, margins, 

of the container. Gas's Other is the no-Man's land, boundary-regions; 

the Other gives Shape to ourselves, which the psychoanalytic Other dis- 

assembles by dissembling. Words stutter, stumble in the throat, the

inchoate flux of oozed language. 



The Capitals hold the oozed World holding Language together.



When the Ghost came, I was asleep. Filigree oozed from her cunt, sur-

rounded the sheets and pillows with darkened reds and blues, almost an

image branded into the Night itself. Her arms were winged, and in her

Breasts I could see all the Forms of the World, flickering, as if upon

a devised Screen that invaded my Heart, beating so loud, so loud. I

oozed forth.
