You can see the lists of words at the beginning - and I can change these 
any time of course - as well as a lot of characters that start with a 
dollar sign such as "$that". These are string variables - they refer back 
to the word lists. There is also a lot of "\n" which simply signals to the 
program that the end of a line is reached, and it's time for a new one.

When the program runs, it asks me to enter lines, gives me material in 
return - and I write in and out of the material it gives; it then 
rearranges the lines according to its own internal logic, and gives me a 
text at the end.

program to develop a theme; as far as I'm concerned, the following is 
also a finished work, a kind of circulation of software and human 
presence:
