Where Julu is, the cube bulges, walls distended, hollowed out, sucked
outward from vacuum, unbreathing, stratopheric. Julu might speak, but
she's boxed in.

Julu wants to speak to Michael Current. Michael refuses, says, I can't
speak. Michael Current can listen, but he can't speak. He's not out there,
and he's out. He can't speak and he thinks, where is our speech here, and
this, then. The Net wavers like an aerial, it's frail, gossamer.

The cube bulges, caught in the vacuum of the Net. In the mourning.
