Bandaged

My mouth is bandaged internally, cloth compressed against the exterior
and interior gums of the upper jaw, upper two quadrants. I speak through
cloth, as if I've ingested Jennifer's panties. Quietly, a way to turn
cotton. It's healing as Jennifer becomes part of me, my mouth her parts.
Outside, snow. My mouth will have none of it. My mouth closes over my
cloth. The voice is slightly flat when opened as resonance, absorbed,
turns back into heat. I yearn that my mouth reach open to you, reach for
you. I yearn my mouth with supplication, that my words are heard and
comprehension. 

In short days, my bandages will fall off or out; the naked skin will con-
tinue healing. There are no sutures, nothing holding tissues in place, but
the strength of tissues. The mouth forms, naturally, its own hole. When I
speak, it is accompanied by the tiniest of cries and offerings. The great
joy that is my mouth remains unacknowledged.
