I remember a conversation that I had in A. thirteen years ago with a young
French pastor. We were asking ourselves quite simply what we wanted to do
with our lives. He said he would like to become a saint (and I think it is
quite likely that he did become one). At the time I was very impressed,
but I disagreed with him, and said, in effect, that I should like to learn
to have faith. For a long time I did not realize the depth of the con-
trast. 

Dietrich Bonhoeffer, 21 July 1944
