Dangerous Space

These words are written in a dangerous space, unhappy, hinged, ready to
collapse; these words need protection; they've got to leave here, go
elsewhere, come into your space.

Safe Space

Now these words are emerging in your space; they're different words; they
tell the story or narrative of the space; of the Dangerous Space and the
Safe Space; they're safe now.

Dangerous Space

These words disseminate; perhaps your space isn't safe enough; perhaps
other spaces are necessary as well; perhaps only a bloom will do.

Safe Space

Now these words are in your care; now these words are consigned to you;
they're in a safe space; they bring the other words into the safe space,
the words of the Dangerous Space as well as the words of the Safe space;
they're yours now, under your protection.

Dangerous Space

For a talisman, for a memento, for a serious souvenir.

Safe Space

For a trinket-hiding-out; these words are safe, they're in your safe space;
they're safe. All of them, the Dangerous Space and the Safe Space, all of
them are safe.
