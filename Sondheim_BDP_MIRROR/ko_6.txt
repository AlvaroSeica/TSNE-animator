and so untitled jennifer says

my snake is around alan, entwined between her legs, her knees clutch my
arms, my hands around her waist, her mouth upon my nipples, her breasts
between my fingers, my legs around her thighs, her palms around my cock,
my face upon her clit, her toes clasped by my arms, my elbows between her
fingers, o alan alan alan

alan leaves me without quote or quotation and speechless saying 'and' the
universal conjunction, concatenation, chaining one in the vicinity of the
other, perhaps invisible inaudible, one possibly contiguous

'and' is the form of phrase, the harboring of phrase, 'and' falls off in
the presence of you might say the other, you might not, you might just let
it come home, just so, _and so_

fingers and arms and breasts and legs and elbows and necks and faces and
lips and penises and clitorises and vaginas and nipples and waists and
arms and thighs and hands and fingers and anuses and toes and cheeks and
wrists and testicles and

(
and a lovely drop of evaporating liquid, as if already fallen, then gone
before the surface arises for a last lingering kiss

                                     |
                                     o
)

and how arousing it is to _imagine_ this _imaginary_ creature, alan, all
present for my consuming pleasure, oh my skin is so sensitive don't you
dare touch me!
