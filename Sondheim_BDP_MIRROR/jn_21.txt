jennifer's hatred of others

i want to steal your girl from you
 she doesn't belong with you
  she belongs with me
   hatred of couples
    i despise your glances smeared across your faces
hatred of useless wealth
 your broaches pins drooling from your fat nipples
  get a life jennifer
   nobody deserves more than me
    money for your work your blackglass limousines
     airline tickets plied with liquor
      strafed artifacts archeologies steamships
just cause i want you doesn't mean i want you    
 you think you're better than me
  i'll bite your head off 
   stop fucking reproducing
    i'll sever your coupled hands the two of you
     i'll pull my frock up and piss on your faces
      you'll love it slobber slobber
i'll make you watch
 i can have anyone i want any sex any time anywhere
  cut your ring fingers off glint glint
   split you in two
    all that useless metal
i'll take your watch
 i've got all the time now tick tick
  i can wait
   your motherboard's dead meat
    your father's lost his name
you know i'm talking to you
 you smell of me
  you always will simper simper
   you're not worth my piss simper simper
jennifer's hungry
 jennifer wants your girl
