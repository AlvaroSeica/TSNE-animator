Nikuko Sells and Jennifer Buys, A True Story


Nikuko sells her panties in Nakasu with a sigh;
Jennifer approaches her; she was just walking by.
"I need some fifty-thousand yen," Nikuko tells a lie.
"I'll pay you more," says Jennifer, and she begins to cry.
"They're highly worn, and partly torn," Nikuko says with sighs.
"I'm getting damp, I'm getting hot," wet Jennifer now buys;
She pays the yen, the panties hers, brown odor on them lies.
Nikuko's first in ecstasy, and comes with great loud cries.
Then Jennifer is home with them, and starting with a sigh,
She slips her clothes from her lean form, is naked by and by.
They're on her face, she will debase, so she begins to lie
Back on the bed, and smiling wan, she too begins to cry.
She's brightly lit, glows in the dark, so virtual and high,
The panties worth a million yen, if she could only die.
