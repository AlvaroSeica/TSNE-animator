741


This afternoon I went next door to see Mark, an artist who also works for
other artists. He was building an electronic circuit that would respond to
audio signals, setting a mechanical mouth into motion. The mouth was dri-
ven by solenoids. Mark was using op amps.

The amp he was using was the old 741, which apparently are still consid-
ered rugged, inexpensive, and enormously flexible, after at least 27
years. I circuited myself with them in the late 60's, building an analog
synthesizer with Greg Johnson. I was amazed then, and still am, over the
beauty of these ICs; feedback/feedforward devices, they can control just
about anything, and are in fact at the heart of voltage-responsive de-
vices. They can be considered analog gates of a sort, a T-structure with
which a _parasite_ or parasitic voltage modifies a reception/transmission
channel; the modification can be tightly controlled, feeding back onto
itself. (See Serres, The Parasite, for some philosophy/theory here.) 

While computers go out of date before they leave the showroom, the 741s
and their relatives continue working in all sorts of places. This fasc-
inates me; on one hand, the fast and out of control feed-forward aspects
of the electronic industry - and, on the other, the strange attractors of
small perfect devices, as operative as neurons, that remain amazingly
constant for decades.

If you've never played with an op amp, you're missing cybernetics in ac-
tion as well as the beauty of process aesthetics... (You can find texts on
these devices in just about any electronics store.)
