"But there is no last phrase."


There is no last phrase. (Lyotard)

There is no end to the series, no beginning. There are gaps, broken
english, bandwidths held firmly in the middle. Signs, reflections.
One face turns towards another. Something sounding like a word.

Cries and gestures, the flutter of a wing.
