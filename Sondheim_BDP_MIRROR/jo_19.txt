Attis for Cybele


Which I began to inscribe, from Catullus, memory, having launched
Himself down on the Phrygian Grove across the wine-dark sea, there
To incise himself, flint-cut the lower edges of the sac, scrotum,
His testicles flayed to the ground, blood circulating as she would
Have appealed to gender-morphology, but this, irreversible, could
No longer sustain the space she found herself in, this Jennifer
Produced from the holy mysteries of the Magna Mater. She pranced,
Declaimed loudly, Cybele screaming in the background, always a threat
Holding onto her virgins, but these balls spattered on the holy earth
Were something else again, while Jennifer sits, inscribes another
Surface, servers crashing around her like waves on wine-dark waters.
Again, again, she begins her description of Attis for Cybele, Attis
Having likewise launched, a router on the Internet, turned towards her
Or others, Aegean, Dea magna, dea Cybebe, dea domina Dindymi,
procul a mea tuus sit furor omnis, era, domo:
alios age incitatos, alios age rabidos, get out of here, furious,
Make them crazy, rabid, swallow balls like seeds furrowed, the Net
Splits, opens wide, Alan's driven mad, Jennifer writes in repetition,
All these skinned wounds, all these Fisher Kings.
