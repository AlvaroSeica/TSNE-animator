What does it mean to spread the following, one machine coupled to
another, you are so breathless, Jennifer, reading across wires thrust
from my throat to yours

What does it mean that I am in the machine? Which machine, location,
spread out across _this_ desktop and _this_ ISP and _your_ location,
fragmented beyond belief I would declare, from the site of the mouth,
from _your_ mouth, from the sight of you, from emissions from _your_
holes splayed out / sprayed out from which machine?

"For I do write from my location, this desk facing this window, the tree
in the distance, storm-clouds overhead, the shuddering atmosphere, radio
going behind me, threatening weather, glimmers of lightning on the horizon

"Your mouth, a conundrum

"The problem of extreme distance, stretch of the cool body, lightning
across beds and atmospheres, walking in the midst of storm-clouds, sites
of infinite mouths

"Philosophies of location, Russell at his writing-desk, Sartre at his
cafe, Schutz by his window
