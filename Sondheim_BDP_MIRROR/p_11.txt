when i move in or towards the desert the dust rose in thickness and whites
are found further apart and huddled or carrying with them, and it's here
that the evil arises, is born of absence, plunder of tiny territories,
broken fences, ocotillo, *marking out what a man wants from his air his
woman,* what a man wants from the world. i do believe there is a differ-
ence. sound scurries on the eardrum of the desert, flutterings, whinings, 
buzzing, it's all down there, the skein at the base of the feet, flip- 
flight of the tarantula wasp, scattered cholla which *are* the scattered 
thoughts of this man or that man. there is no liberalism in the desert. 
the other is the pounding of one's own skin. what is there of the *debt.* 
he'd look at the sky to see your eye, opened like egg-white, creosote 
intensity of the oldest things enduring on the earth. there was always 
the human massacre, male scuttlings around a beaten ranch. he'd run out- 
doors and beat everything in sight. he back was a continuous wound, wire 
rubbed raw in it. 

he had nothing to think about. these were the fields of white light, rad- 
iations slammed into the neck the cheeks the knuckles. he swung the whip, 
there was room for it, round and round, hedging the circle, round and 
round, hedging the circle, hedging the circle round.
