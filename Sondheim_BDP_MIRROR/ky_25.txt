current screens all have sharp edges - not only the ninety degrees at the
corners, but also their very pixel-like thinness - you can easily feel the
cuts by sliding your fingers along the glass or plastic surface - your
hands bleed, drops splatter under the full effect and force of gravitation
- they're dangerous - the windows - that way. glowing phosphors, liquid
crystals, other substances - chemical, poisonous to your body. more dang-
erous moves: the mouse sliding a window from one to another position - now
everything is lost if you let go far too early - my fingertips are torn to
shreds, ribbons of flesh hang down blocking the taskbar already reddened
by bleeding skin -
