Community - RFC


..."to function successfully, the virtual community demands that a real 
one lie behind it. The propensity for trying to make virtual communities 
is comment enough on the debility of real ones, but also on the need for 
them. If virtual communities flourish now, this is due to the relatively 
closed nature of the Net, which means that it is hardly the identity-free 
utopia that some claim. People are defined at least by the fact they are 
there." (Julian Stallanbrass, Gargantua, manufactured mass culture.)

And what can be done to stop virtual communities from becoming a source 
of debility as well? In a real life community, once out of the feudal, 
there is little necessity for totality except that which may be generated 
from within according to custom, or without, according to nation, etc. (I 
realize I am simplifying.) On the Net, the territory is constructed and 
maintained, and would not exist otherwise; there are always shadow insti- 
tutions, ownerships, and capital at work. 

Should there be a community RFC (request for comments) dealing with these 
issues? Is there anything to be learned from experience? Is net community 
always destined to remain chaotic, ad hoc, hacked, overwrought, over-de- 
termined? Is there a way around all of this?

Perhaps the Perth cybermind conference can deal with some of these issues;
perhaps they should be considered on the lists as well.
