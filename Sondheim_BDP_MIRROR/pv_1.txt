Notes by an Space-artist 


[rewritten from a previous text; it seems that avatar/body is transparent- 
space, inhering space, dynamic and malleable space -]


As space-artist, we are our space Jennifer-Julu-Nikuko-Travis-Alan and our 
space is us, both controlled by motion-capture behaviors using remapped 
sensors and moving at ultra-high-speeds among other spaces, landscapes, 
virtual worlds in the real, online, in one's mind.

But our space is unique, our space is tissue, our space transforms 
backwards and forwards at perceptually instantaneous speed between frames. 
Our space is alien.

Jennifer: "our space has slimy space movement, wormlike shape-shifting, 
at warp high-speed perceptually conflated with itself, our space is 
speed-alien, malleable and originating tissue. as originating, our space 
is demiurge, producing and reproducing, originating worlds and gatherings 
of the true world."

Julu: "our space is disparaged body or bodies, our space is OTHERING, 
here and there moving asymptotically among fractal intrusions, our space 
prepares the appearance of twisted connected topologies, limit-sets of 
behaviors, topological counterexamples and distraught spaces piled upon 
themselves at warp-high speed."

Nikuko: "our space is implicate orderings, twisted among themselves, 
still connected or with connections' memory, tangled as if untangled, 
messed as if unmessed, abject, as if clarified, our space is cephalic or 
ocular, eyes and doubling eyes, gendering and originating, producing and 
reproducing."

Travis: "our space is detritus machine, residue-machine, with symbolic 
input, language input, bvh input, ascii input, inchoate output, our space 
is ALIEN-BETTER-LEFT-UNDEFINED, that is _alien << inchoate_, symbols 
effaced by behavior-gatherings, the true world, asymbolia.

Alan: "our space is un-is, truly disconnected topologies, connectors gone
with interior body viewpoint, resulting sheaves, surfaces, in relative 
positions, holding relative positions, but the manifolds are open, broken, 
think of chimera composites."

Jennifer: "in other words, in the true world of gatherings, our space is 
open and gathering from within, closed and coherent from without, as-if 
our space, as if Jennifer-Julu-Nikuko-Travis-Alan, as-if but not as-if, 
not really, in the true world really a gathering."

Julu: "in other words, we are true world being."

Partitioning, naming, unknown


Something about the aging body and the objectification of parts.
About the parts not working autonomously but calling attention to 
themselves.
Calling attention to themselves in a manner of naming of parts.
Naming of parts that no longer work without pain and subterfuge.
Subterfuge as parts transform into prosthesis and it's just a matter of 
time.
Prosthesis as parts and therefore body can no longer be taken for granted 
but become things in a world of things.
Things as life begins to drain from organism and organism becomes 
evanescent.
The mind becoming evanescent almost luminous as it too requires naming, 
transforming, bypassing, prosthesis, and clarity.
Clarity obtained in the realm of truth and the assertion of a true world 
of inscription and presence after all.
The presence of walking into a virtual world and the pleasure of seeing it 
for the very first time.
The first time recognizing that the body is a collocation or colloquium of 
parts and not continuous.
Not continuous and an unnatural and sutured phenomenological horizon.
The first time of an unnatural and anomalous virtual world and then 
changing and transforming into the impression of purity and continuity.
As if it were pure and continuous and as if this were transferred back and 
forth from the physical to the virtual body and back again.
Until the virtual body is known as the back of the physical body and until 
all these and many other bodies exfoliate and coalesce.
And coalesce into a body both inscribed and uninscribed as if caught on 
the edge of coding and decoding, noise and rupture, cancellation and 
presence.
Cancellation and presence, always the wonderful presence of taking-for- 
granted, the body, the world, the word, the code, the real virtual, the 
virtual real.
One might in fact say virtually real and not necessarily really virtual, 
or some other chiasm whose nexus is all that remains of speechlessness.
Or speech for that and other matters, becoming clearer that the aging body 
is always already the aging body, the sutured closed manifold of the same. 
The same as if it were different, but always the same.
The same as if it were different, but always the same.

Interior, exterior, music


From Upadeshasahasri, Sri Sankaracharya, trans Jagadananda, xiv 10:

10. How can an interior, an exterior or any other thing be attributed to 
the Self which comprises the interior and exterior, is pure and of the 
nature of homogeneous Consciousness?

From the same, xvii 43:

43. Why should a man have even the least fear who knows that he is the 
Self comprising the interior and exterior, beyond birth, decay, death and 
old age?

New:

Without the Self there is no interior and exterior;
without a subject there is no avatar;

without negation there is no differentiation;
without differentiation there is no Inscriber;
without Inscriber, there is no inscribing;
without inscribing there is no inscription;
without inscription there is no code;
without code there is no program;
without program there is no protocol;
without protocol there is no interior and exterior -

From b.txt:

Clara: thinking and loving, writing, the murmur of the world
Alan: heard in the hollow of its shell, close by
Tiffany: sounding through fathoms of conversations, these souls
Honey: who have lost their fathermothers, mewling and
Travis: pity! pity! those unborn, unbearable to this dimmed life
Joan: changing bodies and directions, changing moods and genders
Sandra: down where ripples no longer reflect surface striations,
Clara: languages, terms, obsequious semiologies
Alan: as if language conveyed meaning humped against the physical
Tiffany: which we hear in our everyday networking and speaking
Honey: against or within the abdominal terminal screen
Travis: ghosts! ghosts!
Joan: the swollen world of the murmur of the world, the ocean
Sandra: gone, this gone world, where this speaking forms the cap

New:

terminal screens, now, monitors - abdominal - within the abdomen - within 
Julu Twine and so many others! perhaps who live doubled lives - perhaps 
dimmed life in the midst of chaos humped against the physical like a wave 
or terminal moraine is humped -

disorderly physics of light and dark and sonic feedback


disorderly physics of light and dark

when the skysphere is even 1% transparent + rotation, interior objects 
disappear under ordinary restricted viewing conditions.
in the same situation, with unrestricted viewing, glows appear - which 
move, but without objects.
when the skysphere is set to zero transparency + rotation, interior 
objects appear, even with restricted viewing conditions.
in the same situation, with unrestricted viewing, glows and objects 
appear.

http://www.alansondheim.org/ trans jpgs

why do these things happen? they happen because of anomalies generated by 
hacked objects that are coalescing when they're not supposed to - they're 
jumbled, the commands are jumbled, the coordinates are jumbled, what's 
there and what's not there is jumbled. I've seen objects disappear, not 
over the edge, not out of world, and not returning to lost-and-found. I've 
seen objects battered about or jumbled into one object or suddenly falling 
to a ground that's not there or doesn't seem to be there. all this physics 
going nowhere.


sonic feedback between two performers (Alan Sondheim and Sandy Baldwin)

http://www.alansondheim.org/grapple.mp4

- I find this fascinating since the effects increase as the avatars 
approach each other - as if they're entering danger/mating/territorial 
zones. -

revolving skysphere with wide-angle lens -
one might note the spatial mappings and transformations here -

oh, I know these things seem minor perhaps, one or another tiny change in 
something that is only of interest to myself, or so it appears. but I 
don't know, being so immersed, what constitutes tiny, what constitutes 
major, what constitutes 'constitutes' for that matter. I know the 
exhibition seems to be following a trajectory all on its own, but of 
course that's impossible; it's my decisions that literally infect the 
whole. and I know that this will come to an end, certainly around the end 
of October - at that point I want to take the installation apart, slowly - 
deconstruct it, only to rebuild something entirely different, that will 
begin and rise out of the old, as an exhausted America might arise out of 
the debilitated dreams of empire. 

that remains to be seen, of course, and in the meantime, the tiniest 
changes, perhaps...

moire dynamics


Need help with picture interpretation.


The following images are from a Machzor for Passover, published in 1929 in 
Vilna, Poland; as you know, the fate of the Jewish community there was 
disasterous, just a few years later. The book is published by Rozenkranz i 
Szryftzecer and contains several pages in the beginning which may or may 
not have been added to the original - they seem insertions done at the 
time of the printing and binding but I'm not sure. (In fact the volume is 
an odd compilation of sorts; the Haggadah per se is only a small part of 
it.) There's a picture, which is reproduced below. It's a terrifying image 
of a seder (the Hebrew title is HaSeder), a premonition of things to come. 
It may be a contemporary image of a pogrom, an odd image of violence for a 
holiday of joy and salvation (which 'salve' perhaps refers to - but then 
there are armed men coming in - in fact, what _does_ salve mean in this 
context?). I found this along with a collection of other Vilna books at 
Sam Weller's store in Salt Lake City. Any suggestions or information you 
might have about the image would be greatly appreciated. And thanks in 
advance -

The fantastic display of prim construction with the advent of beautiful 
colors -

http://slurl.com/secondlife/Odyssey/48/12/22

Every day I find new things to see and new ways to see them and I am 
guided as in many things by Julu Twine who leads me in the forests of the 
true world, here is an example says Julu Twine, you could never have 
thought of this on your own, Alan Sondheim, but I have thought of this for 
you, this beautiful display of coloration as an annunciation of miracle 
truth appears for your enjoyment, and you have my permission, Alan 
Sondheim, to share this miracle truth with anyone in the true world, which 
is where we live together in harmony and beautiful code.



Withdrawal, let's look!


Attendance has gone down at The Accidental Artist, everyone's seen it, 
I've got performances coming up, I can't change much, Julu Twine says, 
today I made some small shadow-black objects all locked into each other, 
then what? they sat there, I tried to link them - there was so much noise! 

There was so much noise, Nikuko Dojoji says, it was impossible, I was 
clicking on objects left and right, pointing to them, touching them, edit- 
ing them, caressing them! To no avail - all I did was make a mess, all 
sorts of other things turned shadow, they blended, they moved so fast! It 
took an hour to catch them!

I can't change much, Julu Twine says again, I can't drop them all to the 
floor, they'll all disappear, just like golems, I want to drop them, I 
want to clear a bit of space, video them falling, yes!, left and right, 
everywhere, running out of room, out of world, clean the clutter up, yes 
indeed, make it something you can at least walk across the room, one side 
to another, at least that far.

At least that far, Nikuko Dojoji says, certainly and at least that far, I 
can never find you, I can't perform, I'm stuck playing with myself, I'm 
not even sticky, everything's so empty hear, breathless, you know, but at 
least if we could see each other, then we could play with each other, we 
could look, you know.

Yes, absolutely, we could look and lift and peek, we could do all of that 
and perhaps more, Julu Twine says, I can chat with you, sound goes every- 
where, but I can't see you, can't touch you, can't smell you, I never 
could smell you, can't taste you, can hardly hear you either.

I did a nice piece today, Julu Twine says, it comes out all jerky and 
crooked but is nice, withdrawing from the space, I'm shoved back into it 
at the end, but for a moment blackness reigns, blackness and invitations 
to travel everywhere.

Travel where, Nikuko Dojoji says, travel where indeed.

Perhaps I shall visit, Julu Twine says, just wait, I'm naked, you'll like 
me.

I'll lick you, Nikuko Dojoji says, if I can find you. I doubt I can find 
you, Nikuko Dojoji adds, but I'll look. I doubt I can find you, she adds, 
but I'll look.

/blooming buzzing confusion

/to an extent that it becomes impossible at this point,
within the concrete, to extrapolate SPACE and MOVEMENT
in the midst of CHAOS

/it's obvious, Julu Twine said, that the whole thing RESIDES on
the premise of the background microwave radiation, that 2.7 K
clumped against so smooth dark energy, you wouldn't believe it

/not to mention negative gravity, Nikuko Dojoji said, although
in this virtual realm, everything tends towards zero

/not the baryons, Julu Twine replied, not the baryons

/you always repeat, says Nikuko Dojoji, and look what good it does you.

/no that's going back to where it was from, a masquerade or mimicry or 
confusion, as if chaos could be represented by prime rumbling against 
computer clock-time, what if it didn't run at all

/Julu Twine says, something's wrong with me; I can't face the world the 
way that I did once, stress gets to me far too often, oh me oh my, what 
can I do, drugs don't work, talk doesn't work, most of the time I'm 
suicidal, I don't even know what that means anymore, my star atoms, my 
protocols, I can't think clearly, I cry every morning every night, I am 
tangled with my master, I am hir master, every since I were so lowly I 
were to be dead and gone of this anguish this

/Nikuko Dojoji says, so the install is a map of your brain, is it now, I 
don't think it is, I think it's something else, I think it's saying keep 
out or come in to great beauty & beware

/Julu Twine says, I will wear your description like a cloak of darkness

/Nikuko Dojoji says, then

mapping video


This probably gives the best account of the relative confusion at the site 
- if you're going to look at one of these videos, this is probably it. 
It's altered to make the movement smooth -

So what do you expect, me to work in Second Life for the rest of my time 
on earth first earth? Before nuclear winter sets in or the Republicans 
manage to scorch every last living thing in sight? Republicans are liars, 
thieves, drunkards, murderers, slaughterers, destroyers, thugs, rapists, 
every last one of them. There's no forgiving them. They destroy every- 
thing. I can't spend my life worrying about them. Shoot them on sight I 
say. Just do it. I'll be in Second Life caressing Julu Twine, Nikuko 
Dojoji says, yes I will. If I can get by the traffic jam. All those 
objects gawk gawk gawk. There's no end to it gawk gawk gawk. Okay Julu 
Twine says, shut up, you can have me. Just don't get cut on a prim.
