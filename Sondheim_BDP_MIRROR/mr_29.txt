women and women
confluence of hands and motions of hands in dark sleeves
opening and closing of garments and background noise and chatter

ellen's hands leslie's hands azure's hands
hands on the victorian dress and skirt black bows and tan
patched and hand-stitched and hand pleating and ribboning
perhaps used for horse-back
perhaps but sitting side-saddle
she was dreaming of hands there was something about the hands
ectoplasm of the luminous skirt
