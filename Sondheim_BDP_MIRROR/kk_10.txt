**************************************************************************
*
* We regret that WWW.NJIT.EDU no longer supports telnetd services.
*
* This decision was made in December 1996 in response to increasing 
* misuse of our site.  Any documents directing you to this site for 
* anonymous services are quite out of date.
* 
* NJIT had been happy to provide anonymous WWW access since 1992.  This 
* was intended to assist persons without better means of access during 
* the infancy of the WWW.  Now that commercial and academic ISP facilities 
* are commonplace, and with misuse of our system, we have withdrawn the 
* offering.

* Please direct comments regarding this change to "helpme@www.njit.edu",
