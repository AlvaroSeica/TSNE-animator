Strange


I float in pure light and today Charles Schulz writes his last strip and
today I receive my unix fortune, "I know the answer! The answer lies
within the heart of all mankind! The answer is twelve? I think I'm in the
wrong building." -- Charles Schulz --

Today again I do not sleep this 5:27 in the early morning, Azure in bed
behind me. The room is dark; I read and write by the light of the computer
screen. This window is yellow type against black, tan frame set against
blue-black background, window title orange to orange-yellow. This active
window floats in pure self-illuminated space; the monitor is invisible, I
watch the glow of keystroke packets against the modem in the distance.
There is a face on the screen, white, red, and black against black, stare
with dead eyes, a mask, all this covered by the window. She is behind me. 
And that my language always be misplaced in purity, that all buildings are
wrong, that I am that active window, that this text is the occasion of a
singular breath, this text behind me, floating.
