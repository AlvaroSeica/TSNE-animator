Subject: the subject of what might be effaced in relation to protocols or 
    a dense alterity given its due - this happens when handshaking             
    gets taken for granted, when exhaustion takes over,              when
    existence itself appears to tremble,              outside of any
    subjectivity ...

Subject: In this empty space, this space of announcement,   not enunciation, 
  or catastrophic loss of _the body of the text,_   I would approach you,
  murmuring   against all asides   what is broken by you as _this_ is broken
  by you,   what you bring together as _this_ is sutured against the will,
  the cut, the wound, the miracle of flesh   bound by forgotten space   which
  tells you nothing more   than this is _it_ (fwd)

breasts./
