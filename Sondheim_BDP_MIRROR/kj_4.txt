dead white alan lies in a bunch of clutter,
jennifer's broken smothered in dead white alan,
julu's sintered broken in dead white alan,
in dead white alan, look for nikuko, you'll find her.
he's been strung up, the cops have got him,
inside-out for jennifer's not quite there, who knows her age.
they rip his arms off so he can't type, tear out his tongue,
there's no program for him, disabled ugly alan.
something's got to give with julu, cops don't know just what,
but she's suspicious, maybe not even white or dead or alan,
just fucked and troubles brewing. then there's that nikuko,
alan's raped nippon, the second or third time over,
it's time to rip out throat and muscle, he screams jennifer,
julu, nikuko, nothing comes but foam and tendon.
