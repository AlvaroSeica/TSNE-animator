Steering Mechanism

as if the internet text could be salvaged
http://www.anu.edu.au/english/internet_txt swollen, tumescent,
there might be a cancer in the making -
L saw it as autobio - I find pushing myself into virtual life,
swollen, tumescent, evil membrane tissues suppurated 
on the other side -
there are always splits in the real - death, taxes, love -
garnered across continents or oceans - cells fall through, out -
you can't make a message with steerage -
you can't steer the way texts veer with their theory carried, wounded -
operations bring the body home, suturing each and every -
I've Jennifer, Julu, Alan, Nikuko in my stomach -
they're crawling, clawing - they're retching into skins of vomit -
they stick their fingers into me - fingers into fingers -
maybe they're typing this - salvage the fury, savage the writing -
their mouths go out my holes - muffled - looking for the sign -
the steering mechanism for each and every letter, word, phrase,
sentence, paragraph, text toppling over text -
blood count healthy - cholesterol healthy - EKG healthy -
no hepatitis b or c - no AIDS - temperature normal -

underdeterminations of explanations - leaking autobio -
theory at the fringe - diffraction-theory - it's a written future - 
can't give you numbers, tell you the truth - the salvage-work -
future's always underdetermined - even when it's here
