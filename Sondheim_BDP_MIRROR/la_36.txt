Findling


"'Findling' in German has two distinct meanings: (1) as a variant of 'Fin-
delkind' it means a foundling (child); (2) as a geological term it trans-
lates as 'glacial erratic' and refers (according to my dictionary) to 'a
large piece of rock or boulder, that has been carried by ice for some dis-
tance and has then come to rest where the ice has melted.'" (Note 19, in
Breathturn, Paul Celan, translated and notated by Pierre Joris.)

Child: Here I am left on your threshold of stone (pain)
Boulder: I am a stone or thrust of ice surrounding a stone
Child: I will break you in two with my little hammer.
Boulder: I will crush you, ice willing.
Child and Boulder: Ice, Come to my side, Come to my side!
Ice: I will melt and turn into nothing at all.
Child and Boulder: Such is anaphora!
Ice: Aufhebung!
Child and Boulder muse quietly, top that.
Ice: Aufhebung!
Child: I am crushed by the language of ice.
Boulder: I am shatter-proof.
Child: I am dying.
Child dies.
Boulder: I am shattered.
Boulder shatters.
Ice melts, releasing everything.
Ice: Goodbye, das Man.
Exit all.
