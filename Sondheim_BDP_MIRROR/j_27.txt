This is terrible, terribly written, I couldn't see what I was doing, I
come across as an idiot, illiterate, hardly able to speak or write, forget
it, I didn't mean any of it, even the screen disappeared, I used the word
"there" far too often, the philosophical underpinnings are ridiculous, if
this is the best I can do, I should go back to gradeschool, I apologize to
everyone for my musings, this insane need to write, ground myself in this 
space which, if anything, slips out from under me, everything is water, 
and with migraine flashes looks like water for that matter -
