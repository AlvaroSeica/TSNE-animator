speaking to koan in particular


I carry the letter I and jump a space.
I place the letter c shortly after and you begin to understand.
Where a is, there shall you search for brilliant absolution.
An r is dropped immediately and you are near enlightenment.
An r is dropped immediately and you are near enlightenment.
The y lends itself towards the abyss where you will fail and fall.
The abyss hounds you in your terrifying sleep.
You cling to forthcoming t; delusion has set in deep.
The h seems overly familiar and you continue your descent.
An e appears teasingly, limpid and pure...
But the space resonates once more and you are more than hopeless.
The l stares on high at you, huddled in your deepest lowest state.
Haven't you seen the e before, a long time ago, in your salad days?
The t as well, but now the crossbar... the gallows...
You approach a t, the gallows... beckons... uncontrollably...
"An e appears teasingly, limpid and pure..."
And old friend r, as you come towards the end of illusion.
Now the space is no longer fearful, and you gather yourself together:
Only to disappear against the high wall of the I.

Such is the space, and now there is no one to cross!
The a remains unrecognized as the world continues on!
The n as well harbors no feelings of discontent!
The d precedes the abyss, but who will know there is nothing further!
When space comes once again, the world shudders without your presence.
And j states, there's nothing more to say with u unraveled.
No more mommy m, no more papa p, there's always a space
Halting your forgotten space, enlightenment, wall and all of you and I.
