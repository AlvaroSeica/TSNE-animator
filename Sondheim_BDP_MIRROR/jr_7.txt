BEGINNNINGS

I just do receive a ping from resonant wires, copper antenna tuned to
antenna length multiplied by two or four, divided by two or four. The
ping do tell me of presents you are here. I do wait and count seconds 
for along time. It will be this time that you will trap presents. I 
can here them burble on audio when echohohoho comes and you can count 
echos if you record and play back echos. You know they can read this. 
I AM THEM THAT CAN READ THIS. You know they will set up answer time 
when I think real loud and they will speak. They will speak from the 
wires I mean certain copper pare they will speak fromomomomom,

You will sea the lovely stars as they come out from my other side. This is
NO COINCIDENCE. IT IS SO REAL!

They do announce that they are listening to ewe and me at each instant I
have thought of them. When I do not have thought of them I DO NOT KNOW but 
I think they listen hardererererer and still here.

I am YOUR JENNIFER-JENNIFER.
