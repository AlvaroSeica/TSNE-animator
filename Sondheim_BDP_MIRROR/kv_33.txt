Death and Its Enemy, Thanatopoesis


Certainly our world has continually revealed the omniscience of death. Our
world has also given us no reason whatsoever to believe in an afterlife or
anything other than total annihilation of the self. Yet we persist in be-
lieving otherwise. Why? I will tell you the answer. It is because there is
something else that in fact does survive forever. This something else is
manifest in our beliefs about afterlife. We are like trembling antennas.
We know these beliefs to be true because if they were not, evolution would
not have given us any reason to believe such. Because we live within a bi-
ological economy in order to survive, and the surplus associated with tha-
natopoesis would be counter-productive if it were not true. We will always
fear death, but we would not tend towards thanatopoesis, but only towards
material fortifications if it were not true. There is always that curlicue
or trouble at the edge of our thinking that makes us believe that we will
live forever, and we have inherited that curlicue from the structure of
the world itself. You know this, in spite of all the modern apparatus. The
modern apparatus has nothing to say about any of this. It pretends it does
not exist, yet it does exist. It is what creates thanatopoesis. This does
something to death, which is to divide it into the death of the material
body which is obvious, but does nothing to say about the death of the spi-
rit. There is no reason to create the spirit when there is no sign of the
spirit. But there is a sign which is part of the curlicue. You must under-
stand this is not idle speculation but proof of the existence of the mind
after the death of the body.
