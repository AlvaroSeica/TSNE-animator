Jennifer-Julu Interference


tab-wise to the static - word! -
nothing:jjjj:yejjjjs:Julu:jjjj:external :jjjj:external jjjj
jjjj nice internal is in my loose internal
jjjj passion seeps into my internal - turning me jjjj-Jennifer
terrific:jjjj:oh yes!:Clara:jjjj:tourmaline:jjjj:amethystjjjj
Would Clara mind you partying, terrific, with us?
jjjj black amethyst is in my wayward quartz
Ah, jjjj masquerade eaten by jjjj-of-the-open-arms and jjjj-depressed

jjjj-ruptured internal replaces _your_ and other _julu,_ static-domin-
ation as police rocket by, remarket configurations; the nub of altered-
program blanket-x protocols - you can almost hear the gears turning, belts
moving - you can almost feel the cams and armatures/linkages at work,
jjjj-purr of electric motors, water-power, windmills and grindstones -
as if there were a signal or resonance among the _contraptions_ - julu-
jennifer wants you to think _mechanism,_ far away and among us, there
might be? possibility-protocol of _a slight shift to the face_ or _asym-
metrical_ smile - wires are never exposed, fibre conduits - it's all in
the blood - jjjj-purring platelets - 

you may not get the _details_ but you get the _drift_ -
