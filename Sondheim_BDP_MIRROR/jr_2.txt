Playing with the elaboration inherent in the baroque elements of rococo
Netscape Communicator all evening, this critic observes the beginning of
email-rubble, in the littoral sense of stumbling across font and color,
link and extension, sound and sight. Email transforms into transitive
term, translucent, flailing across Websites; email loses internal flow as
transitivity constantly jumps the tracks. As we play, push further
borders, phenomenological 'world of the text' ruptures, opening jewelry
and seduction. What I would give to see you naked cum in my inbox! The
inner speech or vocality of language is lost; the (digital) world
intrudes in the sense of the ikonic (every digital image is ikonic). Play
skitters formations across the surface surfeit.

Yet can you imagine the _event_ of swollen.jpg, not yet included,
Jennifer, flush with the screen, rupturing the text with the potential
for _her_ visible body, not yet produced, reproduced in _this_ space, but
already a deterioration of text, the world shattered by swollen.pink.jpg
as you would no longer say, breathless, lured or seduced into the
product-production of Jennifer-capital-<B>Alan.</B></P>
