Jami

Section from Salaman and Absal, Nur-Addin 'Abd-Alrahman Jami, 
translated Edward FitzGerald -

"Lust that makes blind the reason; lust that makes
A devil's self seem angel to our eyes;
A cataract that, carrying havoc with it,
Confounds the prosperous house; a road of mire
Where whoso falls he rises not again;
A wine of which whoever tasters shall see
Redemption's face no more -- one little sip
Of that delicious and unlawful drink,
Making crave much, and hanging round the palate
Till it become a ring to lead thee by
(Putting the rope in a vain woman's hand),
Till thou thyself go down the Way of Nothing."

And One may well find a Woman's masquerade
Returning truth to truth; it is that Way
Of Nothing that deletes the taste of wine,
The Cup which carries worlds within the glass;
So drugged, sloth's truth emerges in Her folds
Where Men are Lost, consumed beneath the grasp;
It is the Losing that returns the Thread
And drives the Garment back upon the Form
Wherein all Forms are read; let us drink again
Beyond division of all girls and boys.

And what the drink, and what the masquerade,
And what the truth, of Nothing and the Way?
And what the Cup and glass, the folds of boys,
And girls so drugged, and what of Thread and Form?
The formal Garment falls and fails them both;
This is the lesson of the truth of sloth.
