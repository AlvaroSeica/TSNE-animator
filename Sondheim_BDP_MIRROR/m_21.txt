What is wrong with us that we thirst for this space?
Why are we broken, are we broken, what desires are unleashed in the 
night?
Why if we are lonely, are we not conjoined?
Why is speaking so important, power so assumed, here?
Why are the extremities of the physical body so curtailed, minuscule?
Why do you speak in a whisper to me?
How do we dream each other in the night, 'it was the machine in them
that was dreaming.'
Why do we press tightly against the screen, as hackers engorged by code, 
ourselves aligned with the precise edges of each other's bodies?
Why do our surfaces seem deep as well?
Are our presences consensual hallucinations, do we accomplish anything, 
do we bring ourselves to each other, to others, is there an elsewhere?
Do we wear our language, full of misrecognitions, do we displace our- 
selves onto one another?
In the night, when I think of you, tell me, tell me, say to me, who do I 
think, who am I thinking of, say to me, tell me, I will listen in these 
spaces.
