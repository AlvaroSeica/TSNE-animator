Origins of Anti-Semitism


Obviously this has been on my mind; it was on Lenny Bruce's. I can't buy 
any longer into the relationship of A-S, my initials, to the Crucifixion 
which never led to the disparagement of the Italians - far from it, the 
Vatican the locus of that ecstatic intensity which I believe calls for 
the examination of the other end of the body, its origin, feet, or birth. 
For it is the grounding of Christ in Judaism, the infant problematic, 
that constructs a legacy of hatred, the Jews representing the _stain_ of 
the birth in the body (and the crooked hook-nosed Jew leaves the legacy 
of the crooked hook-nosed Christ, who threw out the money-lenders but not 
the religion). I am sure of this, the birth uncovering the birth, anti- 
semitism recovering the birth which becomes simultaneously present and 
effaced. What about this body, this somaticism of Kristeva's which still 
requires Freud, of course, but even there an origin castrated from its 
sources? 

Christ increasingly becomes the subject-object, the _jectivity,_ of
ecstatic passion, the enfolding across, crossing, the Virgin Mary who is
reduced all the way back from the inheritance of the father. The Josephs,
Arimathea included, disappear, Mary Magdalene recuperates without loss
(except in the gnostic Philip, another but central story), the apostles
are graduate students, Christ becomes the focal-point of medieval anorexic
sainthood - and what would the Jew be, but a reminder, much as the parents
of a rock star occupy an interstitial position always already apologetic,
forgotten except to autobiographers. 

With Christ the need arose early for the simultaneous presentification 
and effacement of the origin, an impossibility - which then becomes the 
impossibility of the Jew - which the _signifier_ of the Jew _is._

The Marys get lost in the process, recuperated themselves for the simul-
taneous effacement of sexuality (Mary's a virgin, Mary's no longer a 
whore) and its presence in the ecstatic union with Christ, burrowing out 
through the feet of one body, up through the marrow, brains, and halo of 
the Other...
