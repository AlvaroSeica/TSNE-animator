	do you write to strangers
	do you write do you write
[4m
	trusting in the sound of your words i reach out and touch
	the sound of your words
[5m
	mystery posts, calls, cries in the night
[0m
crying, the voice situated in the upper registers, slow descent, 
are you there
[7m [5m
	do you, do you, write to strangers
[4m    i will return i will return to you 
[0m
	i will traverse your space of webs and filigree, there is the 
black-velvet darkness, there is the felt-darkness and black-leather
darkness
[5m    do not abandon me to my selves, to presence you would you would
	never understand.
[7m [5m
	the darkness surrounds you, surrounds the two of us. 
[0m
	if we could only touch through the darkness of the wires, always
this darkness, always the voice emerging, always the stuttering, 
the throat, or the calmness
[4m [7m [5m
	i imagine you lying back, languor, supine, dark maroons, 
	dark organ music, long o so low tones from darkened caverns
[0m    who are you, who are you out there
[5m [1m [4m
	do you, do you
	write to strangers

naming the moon, naming the air of the moon

we're casting adrift, tethered by air, there is little room
in the glare of the sun as we walk north or west, naming the moon
or finding our way near mare crisium, the sea of crisis of speech 
and of storm, the pass through the north-west of tisserand b, 
into the mare yet unnamed down near the gallery of tisserand d,
towards the walls of tisserand's chora near macrobius, heading
the gallery, heading us off, macrobiu and macrobius t, we pass
near the floor of the circular crater, of tralles a on the way
down near macrobius v, once past newcomb g to the south now of
newcomb j, wandering the valley to macrobius' northwest, past
the triple galaxy of macrobius x, y, and z, no one lives here
down near the basin wandering the floor near macrobius l, a,
or b, and always a chance to approach near the south of the wall
casting a shadow on language or proper name, thrusting a pall
paling on impact on language's noun; we're wandering down, around
south of macrobius, there are unmarked ridges and rills, canyons
and wadis emptied from the beginning of spills of rocks near 
emergence of time: there's proclus j, x, y, z, four craters, 
in the highlands, badlands west of crisis, there are still words
to encounter, proclus somewhat smaller than smaller, proclus t,
not at all, yerkes nearer to the crisis, its eastern wall
bordering, from which picard appears, burrowing in the desert
barrows of the crisis. wandering through the firmament, names 
have, do they not, addresses tethered, lost forever in the moon's
hot weather. what jumps, jumps out at the nomad whose names mean,
and here no meaning names, no wandering ensues at least as yet
to catch the final denouement of words tumbling down into mare,
mare crisium, ready to seize them until tongues, mouth, and teeth
appear, until the empty air.
