The Missing


Boo hoo, it falls apart, it's broken, the limbs come off, the strings
ripped through, there's a hole where the neck was, the image is broken,
representation is always broken, parergon, always framed, false accusa-
tions, only a doll!

The gif or jpeg doesn't fall apart, _it's corrupted,_ speaks inexactly,
muffled - you can hardly hear it! At the top, the real as always, down
beneath, not even the remnants of structure, but isolated bits, enlarged,
distended pixels, tumescent pixels spilling inordinate color. Oh, a mixup! 

_Analog_ imaginary, so pure, always appears through the noise, seduction!

_Digital_ portends annihilation within the frame, rearrangement, death-
wish, all those things we live for. If the packets don't arrive, the body 
doesn't come up!

In text, the body always comes up, always comes, jouissance! Parergon! 
But within the jpeg or gif, the framework's there at the top; corruption
is down below, now you get the idea! Effluvia! What's missing is pure
absence, what's missing is irretrievable - signal processing won't help at
all. The blocked spaces contain the missing links, the public and private
keys, code books of all sorts, encyclopedias of forbidden knowledge, the 
quarrel of tiny private deaths, each marked by coordinate position, 
emptied of everything else.

Boo hoo, it falls apart! I wet myself down there!
