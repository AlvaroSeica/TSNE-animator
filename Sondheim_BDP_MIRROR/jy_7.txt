The second world, of bones, a space of labor, fetishization, conjure, on
Kyoto-MOO, designed by Kayo Matsushita and myself. Rarely visited, running
on a corner of a Parsons Design School machine, Julu has flown briefly
here; I have lived among _these_ bones, churned in the files themselves.


Welcome to Kyoto-MOO!

A moment of stillness just before the invention of radio. you are
entering a world of speaking bodies; everyone is close at hand. If
you reach out, you touch us with your bright thinking. Welcome to
Kyoto!

Yurt
hovel where Wizards hang, bones in front, skins behind
You see basin, human, lump, and stuff here.
