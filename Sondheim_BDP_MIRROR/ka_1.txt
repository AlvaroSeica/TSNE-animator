JENNIFER LAY BACK BORN ON BIER  JULU AND HAIR BORN BROWN BORN BLACK

FUKUOKA IS A LOVELY CITY WITH WITH MANY SANDY BEACHES
CHILDREN ALL DAY PLAY IN SURF AND FROLIC
WHILE SMILING ADULTS WATCH FROM STRIPED CABANAS

JENNIFER SHORN LOCKS LOOKED  JULU-LORE LOVE AND LANGUOR LOST

IK GEHORTA [TH]AT SEGGEN

I WILL COME AND PLAY IN FUKUOKA WITH ITS SANDY BEACHES
I WILL SING THE SONG OF THE CHILDREN RUNNING IN THE SURF
I WILL DRINK MEAD WITH MEN AND WOMEN IN FIERCE AND DARK CABANAS

JENNIFER DARK BURNING ASH-BORN  JULU-RISEN SKY-BORN JENNIFER
THUNDER A PALE PEAKED DAWN      DUSK DRAINED OF DREAR DOWN DEATH

IK GEHORTA [TH]AT SEGGEN

DRUNK WITH SORROWS I EXPLODE   UPON THE BEACHES OF FUKUOKA
DRUNK WITH LOVE I BURN WHITE   UPON THE FUKUOKA SURF
I WILL DRINK AND DRAIN MEAD    I WILL BEAR THE DARK CABANAS

[TH]AES OFEREODE;              [TH]ISSES SWA MAEG
UPON THE BIER OF JENNIFER      UPON THE JULU-BIER
