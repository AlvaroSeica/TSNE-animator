Taxonomy of Performativity of Cyberspace Messages (Email, Lists, Usenet):



1. description of external actions or states in the message
    [someone describes hirself as underage: is s/he really?]
    [someone threatens suicide: does s/he really?]
    [someone claims to be a male: is s/he really?]
     truth or falsity of the message
      [means of ascertaining information in cyberspace:
       intimations of uncertainty
       [clues as to differing identities, instabilities: reading
        for subtexts, deconstruction]
       intimations of certainty
       [header-checking, familiarity in real-life with the poster
        on-line familiarity with the poster]
         what would constitute certainty beyond a reasonable doubt?
         [community or individual consensus, the need for belief in
          most circumstances, disbelief in others]]
     legal responsibility of the receiver
      [current state of Internet or general CMC law: forwarned is or
       is not sufficient? who owns copyright, who owns words? the role
       of the _censor_ as proprietary - recent Prodigy case]
        what constitutes prior knowledge?
         [issues of intimations above. must posts _necessarily_ be
          believed?]
        what constitutes fair warning?
         [is prior _knowledge_ necessary for fair warning?]
2. performative utterance in the messages 
    [promises of the heart, business contracts, and so forth] 
     legal entailment of such utterances
      [traced-by-tracerouted utterances]
      [untraced utterances]
     taxonomy of such utterances
      [those which imply a _future action_: I will marry you.]
      [those that imply _current action_ or strickt performativity: by this 
       post I am marrying you.] 
3. escape codes or other activations within the message
     codes as content
      [ornamental codes: blinking, upper ascii, color transforms, etc.]
      [elsewhere-activating codes: bell ringing, etc.]
      [post-transforming codes: EOF destructions, viruses]
4. header codes or other framing activations across the message
     codes as content
      [telnet 25, changes across Columbia mail, telnet sites which strip
       traceroute information]
      [use of Bcc:]
      [hacking codes]
     the minimal necessary code for transmission
5. performative statements/operations _upon_ the message:
    outgoing: 
     [sending (to, from, cc:, bcc:, alias)]
     [forwarding (")]
     [replying (")]
     [duplicating/spamming (")]
     [deleting]
    incoming:
     [saving (to folder, in inbox, etc.)]
     [deleting]
      [message by message]
      [filtering (kill-file, folder structure, etc.)
       [passive filtering, automated from header labels]
       [active filtering, weighing headers/contents]]
