The Avatars


All avatars act as ascii aligned
Before broken banners bitter, barren, bound, blind.
Cold characters caught, crawled, cold, cracked, calcified;
Drawn dependents, dragged down, devolved, drowned, died.
Early earth emerged, escaped, erased
Full fury fallen, failed, fought for fear, felled, faced
Gore, grief, gravel grown gaunt, grown gruesomely grey.
Harrowed hell hastened homeward, hoarsely hollered hooray.
Ice interned I, immediate, involuted, in
Jostled jingles, jealous, jammed joined judging jinn,
Kissed knave, killed kine, kindled, kissed kindly knight
Like lost loves left leering, like loose lasses' light.
Many might mean much, measured manifolds mean more:
Nothing numerous, nought, never neither none, nor
One. Ontogenetically, organs, ooze, often obscure
Prepared proud phalluses, pricked, placed, proffered pure -
Quite quickly questioned, quizzed, quote  "quagmired,"
Representing "right reason," resonant. Retired
Systems sizzle, suppurating, say, structured slime
Toppling to thoughts teetering towards tendered time.
Unfortunately, unclassified under ultimate unction,
Violence, vexed victims, vent violent version.
We watched while wounds wrought weakened warriors
X-ing x-chromosomes, x-rated xenophobias.
Young yesterdays yawned yore. Yes, you
Zap zealously, zygotic zone's zoo.
