Variations on Stefan Dusan (1308-1355)


ON AVATARS

Should an avatar break down the untoward realms
And attack her subjective dominator

Then the code of the avatar shall be broken down
And attacked and rendered non-interpretable.

Should a subject violate an untoward avatar
In her subjective dominions

Than shall the subject have hands and eyes cut out
And his coding pass to the realm of an untoward avatar.

Thus shall an avatar
Inherit the properties of the subjective dominator.


ON POOR JULU

Any poor Julu
Unable to compile
Or interpret herself
Shall choose a programmer
Who shall code on her behalf.

The poorest Julu
Shall be as powerful
As a virtual machine
Which will code on her behalf.


ON THE LAW

By virtue of our subjective dominator:

Should our subjective dominator code 
Out of desire for absolute perfection,
Out of infatuation with poorest Julu,
Out of love or hack or wrath for Julu-body, 
Should such a one contravene the current code,
And be at variance with accepted protocols
As set down within the current code,
Then shall such code not be compiled,
Nor shall such code be interpreted,
But disavowed as such virtual machinations
Contravene.

No dominator nor emperor
Possesses such proprietary rites
As would contravene the current code.
