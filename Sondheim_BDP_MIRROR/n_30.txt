Subject: James Ellroy, as if he were in cyberspace

(from the ending of Brown's Requiem):


  So I go on, heeding Jane's advice. I have not performed violence on a
human being since hurtin gthe two boys in Bayreuth. I try to appreciate
beauty. Most of the time I'm equal to the task, but sometimes my head
turns to wild flights of fantasy, envisioning other electric calms and
moral stands that might bring me permanent salvation. When I think of
these things, my reason and love of beauty desert me and I hang suspended
like a bizarre hovercraft in a holding pattern over Los Angeles. But I
hold. 
  I listen to a lot of music.
