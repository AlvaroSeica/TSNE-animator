{k:40}: You're going to be late! says the 'leave' program I wait for you
You're going to be late! says the 'leave' program and I wait for you
You're going to be late! says the 'leave' program and still I wait 
You're going to be late! says the 'leave' program and I'm still here
You're going to be late! says the 'leave' program come for Jennifer 
That was the last time I'll tell you. Bye. and I take off and I come for
and I come for Jennifer and I'm purged, she's purged me, and I'm gone,
dismembered, the story can be told, how I was caught and cut into pieces,
how I was burned into my own nightmare, how I stalked night after night,
how there was nothing left to me, how Jennifer was all that remained, how
Jennifer kept speaking, through and into me, how Jennifer wrote all this,
- wrote Jennifer

- Jennifer
