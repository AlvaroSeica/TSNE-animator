The Nikuko

Starrring Azure Carter, Foofwa d'Imobilite, Alan Sondheim

0:00 Color Bars, a good beginning!
0:27 Nikuko pirouettes with three cameras and there are sfx and a text
 introducing Nikuko and Doctor Leopold Konninger
5:15 Nude Nikuko sitting on nude Doctor Leopold Konninger with sfx and
 a made-up text in a broken voice
7:15 Quickcam segments with Nikuko's voice describing her sexual exhi-
 bitionism with the obsessive Doctor Leopold Konninger, central images
 surrounded by text
15:19 Nikuko pirouettes in a transparent skirt for Doctor Leopold Kon-
 ninger, in front of electronic equipment; she is visible from the 
 waist down
16:13 Nikuko and Doctor Leopold Konninger, both fully dressed, dance
 majestically through Quickcam before the studio equipment, and Nikuko
 takes a bow, twice
18:06 Silly sfx and wipes with text beneath draining the image and 
 speaking about the obsessive sexuality of the work so far
19:28 Nikuko in open kimono mouthing AAAAH like a shinto guardian, her
 voice joined by other spirits
23:12 The Male Ballet Dancer moves neurotically through the space, half
 dressed, while Nikuko watches in pink tutu and Doctor Leopold Konning-
 er speaks into a microphone, shuttling everything between three cameras
33:17 Three still dance shots bring this dance to a halt
33:35 Nikuko in tutu and the Male Ballet Dancer perform a Musical Number
 outdoors, superimposed on the Male Ballet Dancer performing on a wall
41:51 Very short section of Nikuko putting on kabuki makeup while a 
 superimposed noh ghost watches and imitates; Nikuko is dressed in a Ko-
 rean wedding dress
42:25 A woman's Face appears superimposed on a train, her Face filled
 with naked limbs, cutting to Nikuko half-naked staring at the camera,
 cutting to Nikuko and Doctor Leopold Konninger naked and staring, cut-
 ting to Nikuko touching herself in open kimono, opened further by naked
 Doctor Leopold Konninger, cutting to an explanation of confusion and
 Trying
51:48 A Doodah song accompanying a half-naked Nikuko and a fully naked
 Doctor Leopold Konninger exchanges places while words roll by at the
 bottom of the screen
54:40 Nikuko dances strangely by herself on the right-hand side of the
 screen while the Male Ballet Dancer in an odd outfit dances before the
 camera, and Doctor Leopold Konninger plays equally odd and fast music
 on the left-hand side of the screen
1:03:44 Nikuko lies exhausted on a blanket wearing a pink tutu
1:04:00 The tape cuts to black
