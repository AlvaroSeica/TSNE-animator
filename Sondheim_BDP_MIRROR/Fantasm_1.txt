	BUCHANAN LITTLE FASCIST SONNET 

	THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO DISMISS AS
	SOMETHING REEKING OF MOLESTATION
	AN ANOMALY DRIVING IN THAT GREY CAR
	ON THAT GREY GREY ROAD, WHAT'S CAUGHT IS LIT
	FOR AN INSTANT, STUNNED IN MOMENTARY DARKNESS, I
	AM AFRAID OF DISAPPEARANCE, OF UNNAMING
	OR POLITICS OF VIOLENT HATE REPRISAL, I WHO
	HAVE DONE NOTHING IN MY LIFE TO THOSE
	IN POWER; STAY OUT OF THOSE HALLWAYS,
	DOORS WITH BRASS NAMEPLATES, OH THEY'VE
	BEEN THERE A LONG TIME AND FEAR CLOTHES ME
	LIKE A SKIRT OF MUSK WHILE TIME GIVES STILL DELIGHT
	LIKE THAT WHEN SOMEONE WAKES AND CALLS MY NAME
