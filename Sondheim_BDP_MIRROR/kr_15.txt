The Tail


Mordor hath a King and Queen, Emperor and Empress, Marquis and Marquette,
Dukes and Duchesses, Princesses but no Princes, Earls and Knights. Porno-
graphic Netherworld hath Vicounts and Vicountesses, Barons and Baronesses
and Baronettes, Priestes and Nunnes. For there is no Fantasy without King
and Princess, no Pornography without Sir and Baroness. Now be advised that
such is a Duchess, that She bridges the two Realms, her Head in one, her
Cunt in the Other. Thus a Duchess is also a Suspension. Rumor hath masses,
soldiers and knaves, clerkes and clerks, franklins and monks and alewives.
A Viscount of a Vicount visits Rumor from Mordor, thus Bridging the two
Realms, his Mouth in one, Prick in the Other. Thus a Viscount is Suspen-
ded. Revolution hath a King and Queen, masses and knaves, clergy and mer-
chants. A mass seeps through Pornography from Revolution, its Holes in one
and Sticks in the Other. Thus a mass is a Blanket of Fervent Desire poked
through with Liquids and Knives.
