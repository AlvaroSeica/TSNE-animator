CALVIN KLEIN - Eternity ad -

SHE SAYS: I look at you and I see myself.
HE SAYS: I look at you and I see my world.

The ocean goes on and the ocean goes out.
They look. They see each other. They're ghosts.

But she sees herself, it's the mirror stage all over again. That's why
the ocean goes backwards, because it's the mirror stage, reversed.
But he sees the world, he's already got the ego separated. So he can sail
it, he can sail the world.

They're locked into images and time sucks itself in and out like breath.
They're locked into each other's air, breathing, and time becomes an image.

The surf looks like the Net.

(She becomes an object for herself. He becomes the world. He sails across
the world which is her. Columbus saw the earth in the shape of a breast.)
