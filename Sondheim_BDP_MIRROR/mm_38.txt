Self-Ex





A loudmouth and depressive to boot. A programming and hacking fraud

knowing less than a ten year old. Absolutely no reason to believe that

things are getting better. Always afraid of losing my friends. As if

quantity established meaning in the world. At the age of 59, I can't get a

decent university job. Avatars save nothing and hardly speak to me. Azure

brings light and a small comfort into my life. Azure has been so good for

me. Azure was enfolded in my arms. Believe I am a genius yet I don't know

what that means. Can't imagine what she finds in me. Carry books as a

security blanket. Constantly afraid of starving to death, being unable to

work. Constantly feel I let her down. Couldn't stop thinking about them.

Disordered of everything these memories. Don't deserve so much beauty.

Don't know how they can stand me. Don't want to have anything attributed

to the wrong person. Dreaming of iceflows, Inuit dreams. Ended up in the

hospital with a panic attack in Miami. Every day I face my own failure,

economically, artistically. Everything is flows and chance, randomness.

Everywhere I live seems like a holocaust that I bring with me. Fading and

evanescent avatars. Hard to accept that Azure loves me. Hold onto my work

as a drowning man. Hold onto small hopes of employment like someone

terminally ill. I'm writing this and sorting this to defend myself. If it

reaches a point when I can no longer function, I wish to be put to death.

It doesn't matter that I'm an excellent and inspiring teacher.  It's as if

my name meant something somewhere. Jealous of people who can take the day

off happily. Jealous of the money people have when I can't afford clothes.

Looking around the corner, Nikuko watching. Migraines are increasing. My

relations with other women have been terrible. My relatives tolerate me at

best. My sister is my father's favorite; my brother was my mother's. My

work will last millennia. My worry is that I produce quantity, not

quality. Nothing in my life beyond Azure, my friends, my daughter. Nothing

is attributed. Police circling the neighborhood again in the middle of the

night. Preparing to grade GREs and frightened out of my mind I won't pass.

She has to be faced with my failures, my depressions. She tolerates me and

loves me and I have no idea why. Since my mother died, my family relations

have been harsher. Sleeping is a horror show. Sociable, which is the final

grace. States of mind in deliberate dissolution. Stress is killing me.

Stupidly add up my search engine hits day after day. Terrified of losing

myself as hunger and homelessness seeps in. The other day I had to

suddenly stop typing and lie down. There's never enough in my world.

There's no end to it.  They protect me against the rest of the world. They

see no point in the work I do. They were dying. This is a sign of

depression as the world melds away into horror. Today I saw tiny turtles

for sale in the hot Chinatown sun. Too much television and not enough

instrument practice. Took Celexa and Valium, hoping for the sleep of the

dead. Turn the video camera and audio on us, stripping us naked. Violence

sits on one shoulder, pain on the other. Warning lights reflected on the

ceiling. Was very close to passing out. When I'm not writing, I'm ripping

myself apart. Worried about driving her away. Would die for her and am

trying to live for her. Writing every day is obsessive-compulsive, and

guarantees nothing. Writing now after trying once again to sleep.

You don't exist. You're not there. You never have been there. People can't

see you. People can't hear you. I can't hear you. I can't see you. I can't

smell you. I can't touch you in the slightest. You're not there at all.  

You have never existed. You never will exist. You're not even nothing.

People can't touch you. People can't smell you. You're not even something.

You haven't disappeared. You're not annihilated. You have no presence. You

aren't anywhere. You're not disappearing. You aren't anywhen. You haven't

been here and you haven't been gone. You're not even absent. You don't

exist in the slightest. You're not here in the slightest. You haven't ever

been around. You're not around in the slightest. You won't ever be around.  

You don't have substance. You don't even have the absence of substance.

You don't have the slightest substance. You're not even a figment of

imagination. You're not even a dream. You're not even a thought. You're

not even an image. You're not even a ghost. There's no possibility of your

existence. You don't even exist. You're not here at all. You've never been

here at all. You never will be here in the slightest. You're not behind

anything. You're not in another part of the world. You're not underground.

You're not in the sky. You're not behind me in the slightest. You're not

in the universe in the slightest. You're nowhere in any other universe in

the slightest. You don't exist in any way, shape, or form. You're never

anywhere either.

you. Your writing has nothing to do with it. Sickness has nothing to do

with it. Of illness, let it be said: it sickens you, Alan. You don't want

illness to exist. You don't want existence. This is your sickness. This is

your illness. You are sick of existence. You don't want to be annihilated.

You don't want existence. You want nothing to do with existence. Perhaps,

Alan, you exist. It sickens you.

(i recently purchased an AST Ascentia P laptop, 1 gig hard drive, 40 megs

ram, 135 mhz, batteries and accessories, for $10 at a stoop sale. the

operating system is Redhat linux 6.2. with the Internet Text on disk, i

carry out global operations, searching through the cerebellum of a

decade's worth of work.)



mining my texts, shape-riding through them, panopticon of searching, the 

analytical examination of the swollen tumescent sphere of 10,000 pages, 

drawn forth - drawn out, removed surgically:



    4  grep spherical * > /root/zz

    9  grep -h spherical * > /root/zz

   13  grep -h tumescent >> /root/zz

   14  grep -h tumescent * >> /root/zz

   18  h >> zz



the spherical shape that is reminiscent of the _eye_ - it's also the un-

spherical geometries, mouths opening to the world's waste, bodies turned

beneath us, indeed, were stromatolites, ranging from separate semi-spher-

ical captures of the spherical glare. we have image on a spherical

projection. i mapped the image to a cubic projection <tumescent> within

the sphere >> spherical normal. the object as well - so that we're

speaking here of a spherical project - contains a _cylinder_ with a

spherical /transmission and /location. your skins expand into spherical

orbit.



tenuous connections, these ligaments of cyberspace, almost a tumescent

waiting for your clotted tongue, so tumescent bodies fill all space all

corners of tumescent eyes ,, body read, produced, tumescent and

pronounced.



_tumescent_ - the street's flooded - where are the _signs_ as well (we're

hypertext on one hand, it is a swollen tumescent world, bursting at the

swollen, tumescent, pubescent, distended, gaping maw's software-hardware).

tumescent computer becomes breast, nipple, vagina, penis, frozen, melted

roots thirst, tumescent beneath the violent temperatures of the solar cunt

piss morph cum ytalk recycler detumescent hir cyberspace lockdown. the

wisdom in this, and somehow this wisdom filled her with gestures

impotently at this lurker nude and detumescent as male after transfer

jennifer into jenital, tumescent breast; still, she wouldn't come. i

transfer maya into jenital, tumescent breast; still, she won't come. the

footstep, shoulders' shrug, lips' smile, tumescent tissue and distended

pixels, tumescent pixels spilling inordinate color. Oh, a mixup!



where i've given up on real life, where I pull out tumescent life, where

i've given up on real life, where I pull on tumescent life, glow for you,

comes the tumescent vocal cords which, separated, exhale or inhale a

flaccid cock, tumescent, just running type across the surface. inside you,

tumescent, your chest swells with the hardness of my tits distended,

tumescent screened on two eyes backed into tortured skin. jennifer swells,

swollen distended belly tumescent with trashed bone and expulsion. saying

is detumescent, insipid; it decathects, mobile vectors, flaccid

inscriptions, detumescent marks and universes, inviting.



i can cry and see so very hard. My body is not tumescent. i do not.

lockdown toes moved slowly into spaces among cheeks and teeth, tongue

tumescent, covered with vaginas, mm swollen labia, tumescent you and

everywhere corners of tumescent eyes ,,



so that, turning towards the computer, half-aroused, tumescent, most of

13 naked, slightly tumescent, nearing orgasm, poets seeking in their heart

with wisdom found they are swollen, tumescent bodies everywhere for the

taking. code articulates the falsity in her, picks her up, strained,

tumescent towards the lens, my illuminated hand, these words written far

apart in time. capital flourishing from the beautiful energies,

tumescent, through the writing or against fingers hovering above the

tumescent keyboard, sense of iridescent _frisson,_ <tumescent> within

sphere >> spherical normal, above
