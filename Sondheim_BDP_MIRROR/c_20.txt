existential anxiety of being in love in cybermind





the anxiety of _being_ simultaneously _being otherwise_ as in _being-in-

love,_ always this dread appears, a reversed emission from the rimless 

hole: this is what appears out of cyberspace, the challenge of loving 

against an absence of barriers, each and every barrier



sick of the spirit, sick of the heart, heart-sickness, twisted by the 

non-being, the absence of sound for most of us in this realm of twisted 

text: this is what is forthcoming, illuminating the body of the other 

only through sight, intention, perspective, the deciphering of alphabet 

upon the screen into language, into the presence and grain of the voice, 

flesh, taste, touch, smell



the sickness unto death, cauterized self against an unhappy horizon

granted as death itself is granted, what is touched is never ever other: 

this is the pull of the syrupy abyss, the dulled coating of the wooden 

tongue clattering its name into the void



the gilded headdress, suffocating, immobilized, suspending the head in 

the midst of chaos, the torn creature of the neck: this is the sugar of

language, photograph, lock of hair, brush of the cheek against a page

emptied of all other, this is the missive and its invisible arrival



the anxiety of _being_ the anxiety of the mater/matrix, the framework 

of the legitimizing other, just as it is the _other_ who tickles, 

massages, caresses, envelops, binds, decathects: this is cohesion of 

imminence recuperating text as cries and whispers, the murmuring of the 

fullness of the world



murmuring of the sound of the fullness of the world



romance in cyberspace producing the perforated body, awash in the sym-

bolic: this is the projective surface of fantasies, imaginary dreaming,

uncanny tears coating the lavender of the suspended neck, the swift 

sureness of the sugary abyss



the miniscule body suspended seen out-of-body, viewpoint somewhere near 

the ceiling or corner of the room, the whirl of symbols like jeweled bees 

surrounding the night-time illuminated face with wide-open eyes: this is 

the reward of love, longing and waiting for the first and always already 

final meeting



always already meeting, the reward of love
