The sexual work we are engaged in.


I can't believe that any of us who are normal would do this kind of work.
Sexuality at the rim is composed of incidents that occurred very early in 
one's life, or a continuous battering or restructuring later on. We have 
only our bodies to offer. We have their uses. They come from elsewhere and 
impose themselves upon us. We stare at foreign landscapes branded with our 
names. We paint them, upon them, shed our skins for you; you take them, 
place them upon you. You wear our abnormalcy; you become the monsters we 
have always been. Soon there is no difference, and we can pass for anyone.
