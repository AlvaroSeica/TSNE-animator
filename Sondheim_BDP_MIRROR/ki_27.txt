Nikuko draws a thread around her arm, just below 
The elbow, it's thin, red, it's a division, it's a line.
The leg is marked as well, left arm and leg right,
Staggered dashes that would be parallel and posed.
They are slightly taut, so that the skin swells, lunar,
Around the moon of her taut body, and if kimono
Were wrapped and opened like silk and doubled boxes,
Near sleeves of flowers, like her arm or body.
Between the the threads, a golden twine connects
Clearly to an Alan placed in front of her.
There are flowers, pistils, stamens, across him.
There are stems, thorns, roots and leaves, across him.
The twine is there on or in the Alan.
A breeze strokes the tsuchi sign for earth,
A whisper moves the kire sign for cloth,
Speech appears, the sign of fire, threads its golden
Way across both bone and skin, the sky on fire,
Kimono shuttled on the earth, the cloth on fire,
Threaded Nikuko has closed her eyes, her neck exposed.
