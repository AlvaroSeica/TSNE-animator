Here's Some Really Great Stuff!!!!!!





Aphorisms from Friedrich Schlegel, translated by Ernst Behler and Roman 

Struc (in Dialogue on Poetry and Literary Aphorisms) \my commentary 

corraled\



(From the Lyceum 1797)



54. There are writers in Germany who drink the Absolute like water, and

there are books in which even the dogs make references to the Infinite.

\The absolute as signifier, token, absorption, nothing more! incredible

that GOD becomes a word! Wow!\



(From the Athenaeum 1798)



24. Many works of the ancients have become fragments. Many works of the 

moderns are fragments at the time of their origin.

\Merlin constructs the fragment within the whole; Schlegel constructs the 

whole within the fragment! German Romanticism begins the fragment under- 

mining Hegel before _its_ time!!\



42. Good drama must be drastic.

\Yes, Heiner Muller, John Young, Karen Finley, what the times call for!! 

This is so exciting!!!!\



77. A dialogue is a chain or a wreath of aphorisms. A correspondence is a

dialogue on an enlarged scale, and memorabilia are a system of aphorisms.

As yet there is nothing which is aphoristic in matter and form, altogeth-

er subjective and individual, simultaneously completely objective, and a

necessary part in the system of all sciences. 

\Unless you can combine the protocol with the post, the machinic with the

reception, feeling the wires with the wires themselves!! How I love the 

wires warped around my naked supine body! Wrapped in chains, a wreath 

crowning each and every limb!!! You gotta love it!\



(From Ideas, 1799-1800)



20. An artist is he for whom the goal and center of life is to form his

mind.

\O how I struggle over this one! Forgive the "he/his" for era, but O how

otherwise true! Alas, my Mind grows to fill the Fragmentary Real, coming

like Drastic Debris towards you as Imminent and Immanent! I am left

speechless, O alas!\
