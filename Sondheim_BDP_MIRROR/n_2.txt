To everyone,

Last night I was talking to someone on the Net at around 3-4 in the morn-
ing and I began getting chills and was shaking and thought nothing of it
and got off-line and took my temperature and it was 101 F which was very
disconcerting; I struggled to bed, slightly nauseous and awoke feverless
but extremely weak; I've been faint all day; it may be the result of
stress or it may be the result of pushing my addiction, if it is such, to
a limit that my body can't take; or it may be Christine's letter to me
that I always live emotionally on the edge; or that I pour myself useless-
ly into this space returning through a Kierkegaardian either/or; or that I
flee from myself and everyone else; whatever the case it is like the de-
piction of cumming in net sex, the outpouring of flooded language beyond
what the body can take; so I will try and cut back, speak clearly, reform
myself, hold back all my secrets, learn to live alone and independent,
face death like the man I was borne to be on the shoulders of others, be- 
come a disciple of innovative neo-pragmatisms, work hard, expect nothing; 
you must give me time, you must be kind to me: I am undone...
