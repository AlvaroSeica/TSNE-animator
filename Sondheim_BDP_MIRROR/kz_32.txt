"so often does the hinge and Azure here"


so often the hinge between one and another reality
breaks as the pins come loose like a caboose
shunted off onto another line, this is that line,
says Azure to me in this space; while, in this space,
Nikuko speaking, says, there are always lights
on the train, there are tables with cool temperature
down at the other end, conductors to tell you 
all about epistemology and the difficulty of veers.
Azure doesn't hear this; Azure doesn't hear Nikuko
come to the grave, dressed in black; Azure's steps
make slight sounds across the floor still under
construction beneath skies inert and out of reach.
Nikuko can morph into anything, Nikuko says, except
Azure, who has moved into the kitchen back from a
city in the West. Nikuko doesn't know that; she works
with @-commands and other tools in comfortable
environments; did I say that Azure cannot hear her?
Azure is inert; it takes her time to move from
one space to another, and even an hour to move an 
hour. Nikuko? She sends her trends, disappears for
unknown times and spaces, shows up for checkpoints
of the database, and knows nothing as her world
just comes to stop elsewhen, within the world of
Azure, who is reading at the moment in what she might
call somewhere else, were she so inclined.
