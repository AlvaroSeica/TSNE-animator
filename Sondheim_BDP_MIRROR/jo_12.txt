Red Mercury


This is a serious request. I want to know about red mercury. I want to
know about spiking mercury with plutonium, reducing the size of the
nuclear device - small or smaller than a baseball. I want to know how
available this material is, how difficult to construct. 

I want to know how dangerous this is, how many countries - Brazil? -
already have it. I want to know about delivery systems. I want to know if
red mercury is _definitive,_ the end of the planet. I'm not kidding.

I want to know about those orbiting defense systems. I want to know about
the resonance signatures of ICBMs. I want to know a lot of things.

I want to know that you know, and that we know. Do not backchannel me or
send personal email. Expose yourself.

Tell us how close to death we are.
