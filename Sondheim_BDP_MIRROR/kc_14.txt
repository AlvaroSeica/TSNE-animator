Nikuko: Classroom Writing Exercises


"Hating Japanese"

Nikuko: "Hating Japanese faced Korea, got rid of the Choson dynasty,
and stuck the whole thing in a goddamned manga you can buy at 7-11."

"Pusan Electric Burn"

Beams holding up the perfect subway temple with circular praying-
humans inside. Or I'd think North Korea just got rid of the humans.
They circle so that eyes face everywhere. I wonder if they are out-
side themselves. But then they're not any more, are they, Nikuko?

"Waters"

Animals, Nikuko - a term from turbulence dynamics for liquid stases -
you might find Deleuze-Guattari considering such as momentary encamp-
ments in flows otherwise associated with libidinal capital - such is
the temporary foundation of this sentence in the midst of discourse
otherwise. I'm so smart, otherwise.

"Buddha Boo-Boo"

Buddha boo-boo canvas suture-bandage, You still think the killer was
one of the people at our seminar, get that phrase out of here, Nikuko,
before it leaves a scar.

"Please"

Please forgive me, I am very sorry, said Nikuko. I am so very sorry,
said Nikuko, I really am.
