night after night i burn in this place.
i sit at the keyboard and try to tear the world apart.
i look for wounds and spread them.
thinned cuts turn into holes, i can't stop myself.
on and on, i'm thinking to myself, there is no tomorrow.
i was supposed to die at twenty-five; i tried earlier.
my flesh chars at the edges of the wound.
it curls outward grasping at any oxygen.
completion is delusion in the midst of obsessive chain.
write me out of this existence; i can't.

i can't; i burn in this place.
night after night, delusion in the midst of clamor.
my flesh chars as the world is torn apart.
at the age of twenty-five i couldn't stop myself.
i tried; on and on spreading words and wounds.
night after night, grasping at any oxygen.
write me out of this existence; i can't stop myself.
