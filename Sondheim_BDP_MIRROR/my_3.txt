I am sorry for this Translation from the Hittite, yet it must be done:

Death and Mr. Griffith

Death, the consequence of Adam's sin, universal, characterized, inflicted
as a punishment, vanquished by Christ, prayers and exhortations
concerning, excluded from heaven, persons exempted from, spiritual,
deliverance from by Christ, eternal, the second death, salvation from by
Christ, of Christ foretold, voluntary, its object, of saints, of Abraham,
of the wicked, of Korah, of Hophni and Phinehas, of Absalom, of Jezebel,
of Haman, LEST I SLEEP THE SLEEP OF DEATH, PLANTED IN LIKENESS OF HIS
DEATH, O! Adam, why hast thou done this to me, O! Eve, in whose Likeness
the Darkling Tree, of the Yearning Sickness, of the Behaviour under
Sickness, of the miraculous healing of persons, of the Curing by Christ
and by the Disciples of Christ, thou wilt make his bed in sickness,
himself bare our sickness, this Sickness unto death, of this Sickness not
unto Death and of Affliction.
