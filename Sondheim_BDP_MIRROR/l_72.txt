(from what's being said - piercing, the cloths)

I think if you pierced me, it would be not the same as for you pierced 
because it would be my only time, because it would be you marking me, 
because it would be a bond, because I would have your ring in me, I would 
love a ring from your cunt, pressing against me, keeping me aroused, 
breaking through my body, making me yours...

And I would love the cloths so I can absorb your fluids, exchange them, 
cover myself in you, so I could take them with me, one after another 

and I can imagine a theater as well from this, taking a piss cloth, a 
blood cloth, a shit cloth, matching or contradicting the day, bending my 
body around the reside of yours, dreaming, conjuring the flesh always 
present before me, inhaling you, inhabiting you

this is a theater of the flesh, my tongue coated with you, you course 
through my veins, our marrows intertwined ...
