Wu for Wikileaks (solo pipa)

The wu style uses a number of techniques, such as string-crossing,
rattling against the nails of the left-hand, playing off the frets,
harmonics, varying tremolos, chording. I use what I can here to
capture the violence of diplomacy which grounds itself in musical
performance.

Generator and Well

(very slightly) (almost) philosophically oriented images from 
children's applications (graphing and turtle) transformed into
problematic statements of inordinate surface passing for depth.
the well uses x,y parameterization with the usual suspects of
sin and tangent; the second is a polar-filter modified graph
of circular almost-but-not-quite-there meandering.

Avatar Wikileaks Server Crash Frenzy for Patrick Lichty

Active Avatar frenzy while OS parcel crashes.
We have been given to understand that Wikileaks runs on the same servers.
Alan Dojoji and Julu Twine respond to server crashes in an undeniable
frenzy as they participate in global geopolitics.
We have hammered home the video of empty space.

Dear Alan,

I love you very much and want you to know you shouldn't be discouraged by 
all those people out there who are against your thinking-type and even 
your working-type, I do not know why, but we are with you, and it is sad 
to see how things are not always a perfect world for you, but I want to 
assure you the next world will be perfect for you for always and every- 
where you want it to be when you are traveling.

love Alan (our names the same, we're not to blame!)

Bad Image Tattoo Pulled from Julu Twine's Default Body (OpenSim)

bad surrealism: glued together
the sphere is the most useless of objects
the breasts of Magritte and open source
the weather of Magritte and gimp filtration
dreamscapes emptied of just about everything
death of fantasy and imagination

no default no tattoo no nothing
