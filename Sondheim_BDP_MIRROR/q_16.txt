Alien Traps and Welcome Signs


I have strong reason to believe there are aliens, from elsewhere, on 
these lists - aliens from other planets in fact. There are too many 
unknown addresses, participants automatically removed by the machinery - 
too many strange voices, difficulties phraseologies as well always 
employed as if to scatter the remains of other tongues across other 
sites, across others. The Net is perfect for alien infiltration, since as 
Camus would point out, we are all in a sense aliens/strangers here, no 
matter how much the protocols tend otherwise. Given this most harsh of 
all environments, then, environments in which neither aliens nor humans 
may survive, this also becomes a meeting-place thereby. So I would urge 
all aliens to finally, once and for all, come out of the cold, out of one 
no-human's land into another; meld with us, make this your own. Together 
we shall continue to communicate, but on a far deeper level than before, 
submerged identities slowly rising to the surface...
