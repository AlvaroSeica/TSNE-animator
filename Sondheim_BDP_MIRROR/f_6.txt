The Songs of 2010





Flake _Down-Generation_





Reading writerly Ovid always from the Augustan period couplets now into 

contemporary English always transfixed from what the Romans said and did 

around the beginning of the millennia holding forth into the positive 

integers - so of course writers always build on other writers - there's 

no death of the author, nothing but the concretion, stratification, of 

writers, writers upon writers, interpretations and reinterpretations, 

writer-cement - there's no death as I said of the author but in fact the 

birth of too many authors, indistinguishable, but there, present, fixed, 

fetishized, held in no or vast regard.



Take translation each from its own period or socius, in and out of dif-

ferent languagings, even the original embedded in the fractal associations

of inconceivably complex social landscapes - doesn't each audience find 

its translation, _its_ translation, up-to-date, all this writing and re- 

writing, scribbling in the ether, scribbling on every buried and dead bit 

of matter dug up no matter where, scribbling on burials upon burials... 



And doesn't each audience find _its_ translation the currency of good

design, well-met - the species exhausts itself with symbolic construction,

continuous modification, a tattered pipeline filtering a tattered pipe- 

line, self-same or similar, a spew so far endless, origins non-existent, 

uncanny, violating in their absence -



O the songs still resonate Ovidian whatever that means, from the 1960s

from the 1980s from the 2000s, just as they resonate now in their fullness

in their currency, in 2010, we're engorged with them, eyes blasted from 

the third millennium already, void tottering on abyss leaning into chaos, 

shore it up, shore it all up, virtual reality against annihilation, we 

bring our toys together, hounded by disease - aids seems naive in lieu of 

the current conflagration - there's nothing to learn -



The _down-generation_ in revolt, gen-Xers never even understood that at 

the center of their name was the same old crossroads, a continuous run 

dividing and dividing, continuous run to nowhere at all -
