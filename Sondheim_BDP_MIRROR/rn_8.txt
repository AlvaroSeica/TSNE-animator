bow, as well as guzheng, bansari, and odd end-blown flute, for qin

need more room, need quietude and place. The qin has some rough
spots, was recorded with a Zoom h2 from below beneath the zhao kuo
soundhole; studio reverb was added to enhance the dry depth of the 
instrument. I'm very happy with this, and the escape from the weak 
interaction bosons, in favor of lunar solar flares haunting the

Particle Jet of damn good music

A jet is a narrow cone of hadrons and other particles produced by the 
hadronization of a quark or gluon in a particle physics or heavy ion 
experiment. Because of QCD confinement, particles carrying a color charge, 
such as quarks, cannot exist in free form. Therefore they fragment into 
hadrons before they can be directly detected, becoming jets. These jets 
must be measured in a particle detector and studied in order to determine 
the properties of the original quark. (Wikipedia)

Carrie Ahern's Borrowed Prey

Carrie Ahern is a dancer and performer I met at Mount Tremper
a few years ago. She has recently completed and performed, at
Dickson's Farmstand Meats, Borrowed Prey, one of the most
interesting, and, I think, 'important,' works I've seen. The
piece, roughly an hour long, is concerned , among other
things, with animals, meat and the meat industry, and human
empathy or lack of it. I want to share the link with you and
hope you'll watch it. I wrote her an extended and favorable
reply, which I may send out in a while, but I feel you should
see this in its entirety on Vimeo without my interference.
In any case, please go to

Carrie Ahern   https://vimeo.com/42007072

and her website is http://www.carrieahern.com .

Thanks, Alan

Text to Carrie -

Hi Carrie, watching this now, slowly, and wanted to say a few things, that 
you're incredibly brave with this piece, which I'm not saying lightly. And 
it's both brilliant and harrowing, and for me, traumatic; Azure and I are 
vegan / vegetarian at this point, and your piece resonates that way. I'm 
not sure you're aware of recent research that shows that herd cows have 
complex social relationships, and friendships; they know when their 
friends are taken away and it puts them under considerable stress. There's 
indications that they know they're going to die. I know from ornithology 
that birds also have this sort of awareness. As far as chickens or other 
confined farm animals go, their lives are so determined by farmyards or 
feedlots of one sort or another, that their behavior is conditioned that 
way - if you look at wild and domestic turkeys for example, the former 
have a great deal of intelligence which the confined animals don't (this 
study was also performed on kittens, in one of the meanest 'experiments' 
around) - for myself, as feel as much empathy with a bird as I do with a 
mammal (you talk about this). Knowing the conditions of farm animals - 
very different from the "Old McDonald had a farm" fairy-tales when I grew 
up, and the pain/suffering they go through, I can't justify to myself 
eating them. You mention the research of Temple Brandin - she talks 
herself about being autistic and non-empathetic, and her description of 
animals follows suit - not their Weltanschauung, but their sensory 
modalities and what calms them. But what goes on otherwise, 
psychologically and culturally, is of a different order, and subtle - the 
research on cattle friendships for example is only recent, and only 
recently as well has it been recognized that birds are cultural (Azure's 
been formally studying ornithology). I'm just trying to explain why your 
piece resonates with me, horrifies me, and draws me in; I think it's one 
of the best performances I've ever seen, because it's life-changing, and I 
just want to end by thanking you for it - - Alan

Hi Carrie, I've finished, I found it harrowing. I'm from north-east 
Pennsylvania, where students got days off from school for the deer season. 
I've come across dead deer just left lying in the woods, all does, and I 
knew that the fawns would also be starving to death. There was also the 
ritual of first blood, but I never saw that personally. Killing was a real 
part of the culture. I couldn't stand it. I couldn't buy into the ideology 
that "hunters control deer" - when for millennia deer were controlled by 
the natural order of things. But the hunters got rid of the wolves and as 
you know there are even bear-hunting permits, even though the bears are 
almost extinct from the woods. All of this came to mind towards the end of 
the video. I think of hunting as slaughter, I can't help it. At one period 
it was necessary for survival, but it's not now, and calling it a sport to 
me is like hammering an infant - the man with the gun has the power and 
the deer has none. I can't even fish. Azure majored in environmental 
education and both she and I subscribe to and occasionally work with 
environmental groups - and all the news world-wide is bad as you know. 
It's reached the point where I forward Peta and other graphic things to 
her because I can't handle them. Some of what you did in the performance 
also related to what I was doing at Eyebeam - I don't think you saw any of 
that. It was based on how to deal with, how to present, pain, wounding, 
and death, in the virtual - both in the 'real virtual' world of social 
media, and virtual worlds like Second Life. I could only work with images, 
photographs, things I constructed; it was ultimately all screen based. But 
sometime you might be interested in seeing that work; it's been 
well-received.

I think this is the best performance I've seen in a long long time (along 
with Foofwa's). It's uncanny, and creates silence in the face of flesh and 
death; thinking falters and becomes a different kind of thinking, or 
growing in the world. And I really, again, have to thank you for this.

Book Review: Getting Started With Dwarf Fortress

One of the most interesting talks given at ELO was on Dwarf Fortress, a 
computer game described as "The Most Complex Video Game Ever Made." I 
review on occasion for O'Reilly, and as a result, I ordered "Getting 
Started With Dwarf Fortress," by Peter Tyson - I want to strongly 
recommend the book here. It has an introduction by Tarn Adams, one of the 
two creators of the game, which is continuously under modification. The 
book convinced me of several things, germane here: First, Dwarf Fortress 
(and other games) may well be the most challenging and absorbing 
electronic literature in existence; second, that it's engendered an entire 
culture around it; and third, it is tremendously demanding on the player. 
I'm not playing it myself; I realize my own limitations. But I'm 
fascinated by the game itself, which is almost "jellyfish" in its 
morphology - on one hand, there's the screen interface, the visual 
gamespace; and on the other, there's the enormous number of processes 
running things clean and quick beneath the surface. Likewise there's the 
game itself, and then there's there's the community beyond the game (which 
isn't networked, as far as I can tell). The book goes deeply into the 
culture of the former, with chapters on things like "Justice, Healthcare, 
and Vampires," and "Dwarf Resource Management" - as well as subheadings on 
things like Metal, Meta, Cloth, Food, etc. - all different industries in 
the Fortress world. The book also describes the Dwarf Fortress Communities 
and Forums.

I really recommend this, even if you're not interested in playing the 
game. I personally feel its addictive draw - only a download away. But I 
learned my lesson with far simpler games like Adventure (which I modded of 
course): knowing myself, I have to stay away. On the other hand, think of 
Getting Started as an introduction to one of the most power genres of 
electronic literature around, and you may find your fascinated - there are 
so many possibilities! - even hacking the game, or thinking through what 
virtual worlds actually mean (this one's more or less ascii-based, and yet 
far richer than much of what I've seen in Second Life). Get the book (has 
a cool cover too, somehow reminding me of Ken Wark).

http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/experiments.mp3

the drone string was exchanged for a thinner steel one, an
octiave higher than the main _sa_ playing string; the result
was difficult bowing; echo and heavy hiss reduction was added.
the result is a speaking from one to another, of images,
uncontrolled and seasonal. _i didn't expect this clarity._


Peregrine Falcon and Dapper Alan

Azure's helping me dress appropriately for my niece's wedding,
I think she managed to do something with me. the pants were
ordered, the ties were from a thrift shop and we luckly 
found the linen jacket on a rail on St. Mark's place! The
shoes are stylish Sketchers. Clearly I would collapse without
Azure and her sartorial knowledge. I might collapse anyway,
but at least I have a running chance!

Please forgive me for this burst of personal ostentation; I
can't imagine it happening again!

Revised Autobiography

http://www.alansondheim.org/biog.txt

For those who are interested, I've revised my 'autobiography,'
which began with a Perl program, and then extended beyond that.
I edited almost all the emotional sections out; what remains
is a fairly accurate and perhaps disturbing account of my past.
Perhaps not. But it's online in any case for your persual.
Thanks, Alan

This instrument has a range of about five octaves - always
amazing to play. Mine is from the mid-19th century, made in
Germany by a company that specialized in violins. In its
original case. One of the fretted strings is missing, but
the sound is beautiful.
