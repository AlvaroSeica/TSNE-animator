KARL KRAUS COMPRESSION MACHINE





"There are writers who can express in as little as twenty pages

what I occasionally need as many as two for." (Karl Kraus)



To force a rhyme which, lying on its back, flounders

All legs, thrusts the loss of hope and energy

Against the sun or moon, as if a tendency

Returns this spatial clot upon its back.



Tendency is towards, and not to mix a metaphor,

Which I won't do, is towards something which

Is not where it could be before the tendency,

Such as fascism, for everything



Flies on the surface of an enormous rope

Pulling its own weight behind its legs, dull gleam

Ahead, as if something were there, which it is not

Or rather, the fleeing tendency of time.



You might have known I write beyond the speech

Of which ridicule has barely parted, continuous work

On subject and its objects, of nothing in that space

Beyond the names. This beyond is my written leg,



Just one, falling everywhere beside the point,

Crippled in every direction, but there at least

A gesture in every direction, which I am not against.

The mechanism on the left contains a _cylinder_ with a spherical 

bearing held in place. An arm extends from the bearing with an

attached secondary arm at right-angles. Even with a limited 

degree of rotational freedom, the secondary arm is capable of 

alignment with any given point in three-space.*



Playing fields are drowned by words or dreams because

They bend, rip, are torn asunder, sodden, dull, because

They are not there but made from sentiment, because

Death works hard on them, returns a loss become a loss because

Victory is a young girl or boy hard upon a playing field because

The field is all their world laid out before the names because

The names don't amount to much at all because

They're not there, and nothing is intended because

The boy and girl are dead and no one plays there because

Playing fields are drowned.**



"How much material I would have if nothing happened!" (Karl Kraus)
