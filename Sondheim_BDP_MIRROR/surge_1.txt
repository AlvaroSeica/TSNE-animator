Surge compendium

"Surge is the overthrowing of all values, ideologies, and 
structures. It is the absolute overthrowing of all histories, 
privacies, persons. It is the total extinction of all species, 
including our own. It is the scorching of the scorching of the 
earth. Let's talk about this. Let's build around the Surge. 
Let's build around the dying and absolute annihilation. Let's do 
it." (ca 2015)

Proceed.
A pixel is a digital object.
Between one pixel and another, there is annihilation.
Annihilation seethes.
There is nothing else but an epistemology of demarcated 
positions and ontology.
Post-digital is digital; post-digital has equivalent 
epistemology.
A digital object is substrate-dependent.
The substrate is an object and from this we adduce strata and 
structures of digital objects.
Proceed.
The Surge is just that, the Surge of digital objects and 
substrates, replacing everything in the world.
Annihilation is the potential for transformation of everything 
in the world.
Annihilation to the limit is extinction.
Abjection and truth are intertwined.
Abjection and truth inhabit the substrate.
The digital object is a mapping of its substrate and its 
substrate is subject to replacement, duplication, reassignment 
and other transformations.
The substrate is a moment of the digital object.
The entanglement of truth and abjection within the substrate is 
within a continuous state of annihilation and potential wells.
The digital object is an object of reading; the substrate is a 
surface of writing. 
The Surge loads substrates with digital objects.
Proceed.
The Surge replaces objects with digital objects.
Aura is always an entangled raster.
The Surge replaces aura with increasingly fine rasters.
Rasters are inscriptions and demarcations.
One might say that rasters are inscriptions within the 
metaphysical, that substrates possess no rasters, that mapping 
is from raster to substrate.
The digital object is a choice.
The digital object may be a choice of a substrate object.
If a substrate object is chosen or not chosen, it will be 
scorched.
If a substrate object is chosen, it may be inscribed.
The inscription of a substrate object is not a substrate object.
The inscription of a body is not a body.
The inscription of a body may inhere within the body, and may be 
entangled within the body.
The substrate of an inhered inscription is within states of 
annihilation and potential wells.
The digital object neither exhausts physical objects nor its 
substrate.
The digital object is an insertion into protocol farms and 
networks, including translations fundamentally based on the 
employment of process and power; to the extent that the digital 
object functions as an insertion, it is subject to movements 
across substrates.
Proceed.
The digital object is en garde. 
The digital object is an instance.
The scorched earth of the scorched earth is annihilation to the 
limit and the elimination of the instance.
Reproduction of digital objects is finite.
A reproduction machine itself may be reproduced.
At the heart of the reproduction machine, at the heart of any 
object, digital or otherwise, is annihilation.
Annihilation inhabits the absolute, and the desire for absolute 
annihilation constructs the scorched earth of the scorched 
earth.
Proceed.
The Surge constructs a new earth, new habitus, new environment.
One cannot turn back, one cannot return, from the Surge.
The fundamental characteristic of the Surge, at this point, is 
the simultaneous recuperation of every history, every culture, 
every text, and the annihilation of every history, every 
culture, every text.
The simulacrum of recuperation is a simulacrum.
Simulacra are simultaneously recuperated and annihilated. 
The Surge proceeds from fundamental annihilation.
The Surge is simultaneously the relativization of the world, and 
its absolute. 
Proceed.
The Surge is violation fabric; on the nub of the Surge, we bear 
witness to annihilation.
Proceed.
It is not even a matter of time.
It is not even a matter of bearing witness.
There are no matters of which 'it is a matter.'
Proceed.
The _mob_ of the Surge.
Proceed.
The _overwhelming_ of the world, of any other world.
Uselessness and annihilation of philosophies.
Proceed.
