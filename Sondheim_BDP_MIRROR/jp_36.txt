-Subject: Re: Frame G

and then I think that everything goes into the novel.
we have never left the novel. 
Once the idea is proposed, one cannot escape it.
Like when someone gets to realize the placement of your
tongue. And how you use it on a minute 
by minute basis. The concept is the action.
A new form of performativity.
	G is a trap. G is always a trap. Because s/he is a
frame and self-recursive. S/he is the frame that goes
around even the computer monitor. Like a new pair of 
glasses you cannot take off.
	Where does a novel end? Where does the reading
experience end or even begin? When you prompt yourself
to begin? Or is it before, when you learn the abilities to 
assimilate the information. (This is not a question.)
