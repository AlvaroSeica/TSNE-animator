Singing





Humo kupliaku natho humo tokiyo /now the eagle is made now it will 

destroy us all/



"These songs were the property of certain mean and were the means by 

which they put forth their psychic power for the healing of the sick. 

Persons of serious mind might join in the songs when a sick person was 

being treated. By this means they added their quota of power to that of 

the doctor. For this service they were rewarded by a share of the feast. 

Thus there were many persons in the tribe who knew the songs that were 

sung by the medicine men but they would not sing these songs except when 

led by the medicine men. If the singers or spectators were disrespectful 

or inattentive they were stricken with the diesase for which the patient 

was being treated." (Densmore, Papago Music, 1929)



Wanitho ci makai coi niathanur vavazaza /I will become like a medicine 

man my feathers are growing longer/



my words lala are like songs lalal they belong to me

you hear my words lala like my songs lalal they belong

my words lala are my own are not Papago lalal

in a book lala they belong to you lalal in a book

in my words lala are my words lalal they belong

when you sing lala them you are sick

when you sing them you are sick lalal



my mail comes into my heart my mail is blood of my breast

my mail goes out of my heart my mail is milk of my breast



lala

lalal

lala
