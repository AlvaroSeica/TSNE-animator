Perhaps she is looking elsewhere and mourning. Perhaps she is carrying the 
globe on her back. 

I insist that, as with all globes, this one is invisible.

Rilke through Gabriel Marcel: "We drift between Christ, the two Maries and 
the Saints. We are lost among forms and voices. We are deceived over and 
over again by this half-familiar element which causes neither surprise nor 
fear and does not tear us from our everyday outlook. We get accustomed to 
this, but there can be no getting accustomed to finding God."

Foucault on Binswanger: "It is important that the image possesses its own 
dynamic powers, that there is a different morphology of space when it is 
free, luminous space and when the space put into play is imprisoning, 
dark, and stifling. The imaginary world has its own laws, its specific 
structures, and the image is somewhat more than the immediate fulfillment 
of meaning. It has its own density, and the laws which govern it are not 
solely significant propositions, just as the laws of the world are not 
simply decress of will, even a divine will. Freud caused the world of the 
imaginary to be inhabited by Desire as classical metaphysics caused the 
world of physics to be inhabited by Divine Will and Understanding: a 
theology of meanings, in which the truth anticipates its own formulations 
and completely constitutes them. The meanings exhaust the reality of the 
world which displays that reality."
