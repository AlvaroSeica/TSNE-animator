Ontological Creation of Lackluster Worlds (LW)

which would replace the enormous, insurmountable abyss of spaces and
times, these maternal atmospherics, differentiated -

lacking the _specific luster,_ _specific gravity_ of the real, molecular
spectra, striations from dying stars,

one after the other, for a penny a pound a disme a shekel, falling into
ordered cornucopia, blue and red billiard ball models lending themselves
to logarithmic spirals, each a fully developed atmospherics, lifeforms,
warm and cool

for next to nothing, for nothing, lived there, ontologies bursting at the
seams, many-ontology model of universal spaces (I live within you live
within me) (give you mine give you yours)

whole universes fall on the Grund, foundations topple on foundations,
panoply of the surfeit of worlds

do they all have the stickiness of gravitational pull, numerical thrusts
of unary additions, subtractions of sad goodbyes

lackluster worlds for lack of goodbyes some without a world spoken o'them

unnamed sad worlds and creatures wide eyed open to every radiations
