the cool world


it's up to us to generate interesting content, lure ourselves into our
domains, existential inhabitants of spaces like monkeys on our back, like
drug monkeys, cool artifacts of our _undoing_

we generate our interesting content for the amusement of others, without
which there would be no domains; we're all existentialists within the
abyss of absent protocols, cool artifacts of our _doing_

manufacturing content such as this, she said, I'm luring you for my amu-
sement, the further seduction of readers and writers, annihilation- jun-
kies riding into oblivion, the last cool leaders of our _done-to_ tribe

you'll leave us, she continued, if we're not smart enough, clever enough,
lured enough, facing the void we pour ourselves into, night-time junkies
of the fiber-optic vectors, we'll tell you how we've come _undone_

she said who's to say I'm not a he, luring you in, you always assume I'm
heterosexed, living the rim, filling the hole; it's queer desire anyway
she said, cool riders into the _done_ dawn beyond life and far-out death

the gone world we're done for, the cool world, we're lost-gen, holy wri-
ters straddling wires for the first millennia, down in drawn dusk and
doom, up in all-night wryter-rider highs riding our own cool minds

drawn _down_ and sunbeam sunbeam sunbeam
