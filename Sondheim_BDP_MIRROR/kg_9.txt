Do I live in Japan? Have I lived anywhere?
Do I wander in a desert? Is this Shumer, Akkadia?
In Akkadia I have seen ghosts; in Japan as well.
I am inundated by ghosts. I am inundated by ghosts.
They do not speak to me; I do not hear voices.
They are invisible to me; I do not see wraiths, 
uncanny shadows, the glimpse of drawn faces,
in the middle of a howling night.
They push and pull at my body. They pull it apart.
They pull at the mind leg arm penis. I do not know
if they have eyes or mouths.

Shall there be more? Their limbs form breasts
on my body. Their lips form cavities against my throat.
They break my back with swollen flesh. My back
has been broken in many places. I am told
my eyes have bright red light, one can see for meters
around my skin. They take my skin. I think they say
"This is JNJ," over and over again, I understand
them. They sway on my knees; my nipples are hard
with inner curves of other fingers.

Their lips
