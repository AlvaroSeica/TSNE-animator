<06:16 Alan>

Alan says: i will start with my name and end without it
i'm ashamed of my name of what i have done here
done here and elsewhere in america in latvia
in germany in virtual city in estonia in arenaland
where i have misbehaved in deep misbehavior
:cries i can never absolve myself i have no freedom
:weeps i can move neither to the left nor right
:whimpers I can ascend the depths descend the heights
cry my beloved homeland, weep lands of mothers and fathers
call me forth and call me back towards the winter walls
towards the wolves and foxes towards the merlin and eagle
for the eagle shall destroy the server and the wolf the client
i weep for nothing has prepared me for this coming forth
this coming towards the horizon of darkness
i carry this within me i break myself against it i log out
my name obscure see that thing there is weeping
those shoulders hunched the head bowed the folded body
bowed the arms and legs bowed the neck the torso crushed
it lies there it is a stain it folds up it disappears
the stars go on it isn't for them
it isn't for the sun or moon either it isn't for the air
it has wound itself tight it has spiraled into control
spiraled: into control
in estonia it is gone from me in germany it is gone in latvia
in arena land in lithuania it is gone from me in america
it has never been in america in virtual city
it has never been anywhere and will never be anywhere
it is gone weeping just as one might say
"He is gone from the city and maybe has left the country"
"And quit, I think he's quit now, I'm almost certain."

desperate cluster f**cked

http://lounge.espdisk.com/archives/1122 (best)
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/ext.mp3 
 - solo long-necked saz -

because at the core of it all i recognize i don't know what
i'm doing, well then, the best way to proceed is to create
clusters which serve as homes in the midst of the nomad; 
they can be accessed and surrounded and that's what happens
here, so many half-tone approaches to and from those strange
attractors of stability that leave one breathless and scared
of the movement one to another, it's almost as if one can
miss and slide forward or backward, frightening! so screwed
with the scales, so many scales, short-termination memory 
holding the last sequences in abeyance. and then there's 
always the question of technique, hands need prior knowledge,
fingers follow as if in (natural) kinds. a stretch may 
collapse or a fret rattle, and sometimes a leap to another
field is the only way out. i work towards long forms, this 
way everything gets a chance to settle down, eventually some
good might come out of it, perhaps saving a life or two ...


Baritone Horn with Delay!

http://lounge.espdisk.com/archives/1124 (best)
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/band1.mp3

Not only a way to cover up errors (snuff them
out like a candle wick!), but to create a kind
of musical beauty I wouldn't otherwise have
access to, I imagine streams and clarion calls,
and tall mountain peaks, cataracts...



How they Sound and What I Said

What I Said

Testing sentimental Denist with 13 they are like impending down 
the hogs mending molding souls or other car that runs on the spot 
where voting for boating five Boateng Katsuren no things are to my 
loss in more than lasting like Mels cello arrives John feared 
around you and bells and all-around underhanded that I am staring 
at me Jamie when I'm here where Lester Lester Lexi are sailing 
meetings reading George something since Agraria that long are you 
really come running when I meet Lance are praying when I am out on

flying a reckoning of the times are leaning aerospace I'm calling 
all to find a log recommending Sauls L'ennemi's Allegra because I 
won't stop laugh too hot decoding this and because it was 
something about find a page to Brooklyn and resting the Beelz 
Festin's achievements in route reveling in Monday 13 there are 
like that are all planes faster inside the rattling the Miedza 13 
there are lakes and all aregs. 

Testing Sansar Revill Dimis with 13 there are like they're playing 
down to the hogs mending molding souls or other kinds of rings 
won't out to f*ck we're voting foreboding five Boateng Kazura no 
things heard on my lost symbol rate on the last King like Mels 
cello arrives John feared around here and bells and all-around 
underhanded what I am shaping are maintained when I am here we are 
Lester Lester lurks birds calling meetings hurrying George 
something Seseragi long are you really comprehending what I maple 
leaves are praying when I am out all the last thing I want to do 
the last thing I want to do a lease Mirch Sirk flying or reckoning 
of the lines which are leaning aerospace and calling all to find a 
log recommending soles of any Mies Alegr because I well laugh too 
hot decoding this and because or something or my find a page to 
percolate on resting the Beelz Festin Cecy rattling Amandla 13 
there are like that are all playings. 

Festering signs are rattling the minds with 13 there are lakes and 
all are playing down to the hogs mending moles or souls or other 
kinds that rings won't Cal to flock we've boding foreboding five 
boating and cause there are no things heard that on my laws to 
bowl raid on the last King like Mels Celo are rhymes which aren't 
feared around here and calls that all around under handing what I 
am shaping or maintained when I am here we are a luster Lester 
lurks Burks calling meetings hurrying cured Somethings are seared 
in long are you really comprehending what I Maple leaves or 
praying when I am hell the last thing I want to do the last thing 
I want to do only smirks are flying or reckoning of the lines 
which are leaning there is steaks and all are calling down to find 
the log recommending souls or any minds that linger because I will 
laugh too hot decoding this and because there is something heard I 
might find a page to percolate on resting the bells

L'orchestre mind or happening the finds which are leaning there 
are rakes and all are all laying down to the blogs recommending 
moles or any other kinds that fingers won't Cal to rock we coding 
this and pause there is no thing birds that I might L'ange to 
alert Kool-Aid on last thing the hell so are times which aren't 
leered around here and dawns do you all surround under handing 
what I am capable of making when I am there we are just Lester 
lurks calling rings marrying beard

Because there is a bird that I might state trying to concentrate 
on testing the wells where the water flows although there naked 
and when my call at finding God beginning with any other kinds of 
experiences but there really isn't anything because I tend to 
paint and seal fast trying to make birds which are feared around 
here and strong do you all are understanding what I am capable of 
saying when I am well best thing this only works are jerks who are 
seconds of the times which means there is naked are all falling 
down to find the clog commenced roll any kinds of things.

hyrm

http://www.alansondheim.org/hyrm.mp4
(wait until it loads, it's worth it)

modified alan sondheim oud chris diasparra tenor
second and third lives blessings
hymn to hyr

where they break apart and come together with finesse
the filagree develops and entails the synthesis
beyond that the sounds meld into coherency just before
 the dark
 the dark and the boundary is a membrane
"in my world," all surfaces are boundaries
"in my world," all boundaries are membranes
and the dark, the dark never comes, the dark always
 waits
the world is a hyrm and hymn to the dark

"preposterous," you say, "bonehead"

[ I write this. I invent nothing. I am known for 
nothing. I have no cleverness. Those sayings aren't
 mine. I have no product. I have no product plan. 
I am not an entrepreneur. I have no marketing
affinity. I cannot replace all you know about 
something with something else revolutionary. I am
tossed. Today I noted my neural twitches come more
often. Today I noted whether something revolves
clockwise or anti-clockwise depends on the 
location of the observer. I am too late for 
personal genetic engineering. I shall die sooner
than most of my age group. The very stress that
threatens to bind me to the world will kill me.
I worry constantly about my partner. I cry over

My Estonia

Taking a picture in Estonia

http://www.alansondheim.org/taking.png

The haven of Estonia 

- A beautiful osprey nest on the border of Estonia and Latvia - 
And so I wanted to honor Estonia and Latvia, and you cannot read 
these animals, black storks in Estonia, only one I found, in 
Estonia. I wrote the sysadmin and he gave me a name which was a 
remnant of Estonians who had been in the talker before. So they 
were ghosts. I didn't understand their dialog - it was in Estonian 
processed from an abandoned Estonian talker, names changed, 
eliminated the last comments of the Estonians who used it years 
only one I found, in Estonia. I wrote the sysadmin and he gave me
