A 1987 Sony Watchman tuned to the cosmos, signal processed. 
Analog tuning, either UHF or VHF band and bandwidth. It's easy 
to breathe the air of the cosmos, skein of cosmic networking, 
mirrored by fungi down here where we live and die. It's easy not 
to die, become forever space and time dependent on universal 
destiny of our universe. I name our universe among multiverses 
Our Neighborhood = ON, and within 6000 languages here and 
billions elsewhere, the translation of ON or ON within a 
parenthetical, the performative of nomenclature, {}ON{} to be 
dissipated and interpreted or discard as unfit or fit. I pray 
and {s}pray particles and configurations that this might be the 
case. I {s}pray that this might be the case.

Birthberth Our Neighborhood, continue the Young Explorers


http://www.alansondheim.org/birthberth17.png
http://www.alansondheim.org/birthberth18.png
http://www.alansondheim.org/birthberth19.png

The first raindrops that fall in a storm are called Young 
Explorers.

But where does the storm begin and end? ask the Young Explorers.

And has it been before, is it reborn anew, is it ab nihilo from 
primordial chaos, from nothing, from virtual vacuums? continue 
the Young Explorers.

And who is to say what is first, if the mountain is higher than 
the valley, if the valley is lower than the mountain, if the 
plain is wider than the sea, if the sea is bounded by the plain? 
continue the Young Explorers.

And who has been here before us, what other drops might exist in 
other plains, on other mountains, on other seas, and how would 
we know or not know? ask the Young Explorers.

And who might be after after us or long after us, and would they 
be the first, and would they think of themselves as the first of 
the Young Explorers? continue the Young Explorers.

The first raindrops that fall in a storm are called Young 
Explorers.

NON

{N}O{N} -| Not Our Neighborhood

http://www.alansondheim.org/NON.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/NON.mp4 *

Interpretation of sentience, signal and communality, cat and 
human mutually orienting communicative domains. NON video traces 
interpretations of sentient movement among abstracted objects: 
one knows something is lurking, organic-machinic life, by virtue 
of the trace. This is elsewhere, elsewhen, elsewise; this 
motions, catalyses and cheers time forward, forwarding time, 
license of calatysis and cheers.

The cat recuperates this within ON, our neighborhood, and the 
immediacy, imminence, of our habitus, our lived environment.

This feline recuperation is exemplary of Freud's uncanny, slips 
of consciousness, deja vu, slippage of consciousness, and the 
knowledge (of the ontology and epistemology) of _otherwise._

" I name our universe among multiverses Our Neighborhood = ON, 
and within 6000 languages here and billions elsewhere, the 
translation of ON or ON within a parenthetical, the performative 
of nomenclature, {}ON{} to be dissipated and interpreted or 
discard as unfit or fit. I pray and {s}pray particles and 
configurations that this might be the case. I {s}pray that this 
might be the case. "

ON = our neighborhood universe, by projection, on top of, on the 
bottom of, our universe.

NON = not our universe; therefore either 

N = nowhere if no multiverse or

NON = elsewhere, within one or more universe in a populated 
multiverse

ANON = elsewhere, within a designated but unknown universe in a 
populated multiverse, ANON as in "a not our neighborhood 
universe"

V{ANON,ON} = the set of characteristics of all multiverse 
universes including our own, which may be written V{(AN,1)ON} 
which neatly simultaneously emphasizes our home base ("1") as 
well as V, "all" and note that

V and ANON are slippages which may be restrained by relays 
within AN

This is at best a game which depends on the useless 
clarification of language: nothing lost, and nothing gained. It 
is a sloppy game: N = "not" but also "neighborhood" and A = 
"all" but also resonates with the poetics of anonymity which 
excludes ON, but recuperates it, to the extent that our universe 
- "The Local" - itself is perhaps minimally accessible and 
infinitely unaccessible. Rather than continuums (Peirce or 
other) we might refer to _percolations_ of accessibilities and 
inaccessibilities. In the meantime, there is _no way whatsoever_ 
to grasp the immensity (ON) and immensities (ANON) at stake, 
except by virtue of a poetics of extrapolation and 
inaccessibility, as if the granularity of percolation were 
fundamentally irreducible. We are swallowed whole by these 
considerations, and the languaging, which may appear to possess 
sense of one or another form, turns out to be nothing more than 
a _cipher_ that is discernible only by name (ANON, etc.), and 
not at all, whatsoever, by content or reference. All of this 
might be rewritten

^ = {[0-9, A-Z]} =

in some regular expression, the bracketed terms replaceable by 
anything whatsoever, and the equivalence or substitution in the 
third position, emptied of all content.
