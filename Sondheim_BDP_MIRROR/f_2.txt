(Life and Nearly Decomposable Hierarchies, follow-up post)





Was it Simon who years ago wrote about nearly decomposable hierarchies -

that for example, Aristotelian logic (including laws of distribution,

etc.) could hold on a macro-level almost and in spite of its failure

within the quantum domain? One of the stranger characteristics of our

universe is the ability of levels, spaces, and times, to nearly foreclose

upon each other, seamlessly, much as the ego appears to do the same (and

yet is more of a coagulating/inscribing flow). In which case, life itself

exists as foreclosure, which is why I think we can talk about computer

life _and_ ignore the matrix which provides its energy. Clifford pointed

out that entities within a closed universe could still determine its local

topology and curvature (this before Einstein); whether computer life could

see "elsewhere" remains open to question. Anyone who believes in spirit or

other manifestations of apparent nearly autonomous (although perhaps

interpenetrating) realms would assume, I assume, that life is inductive in

such a fashion that its very gestural qualities take it beyond or beside

itself. But one in return could conceive of spirit _within_ artificial

life, in which case perhaps the questions continue to be asked. As in at

least some models of inflationary universes, there may be realms that we

literally have no access whatsoever to. We seem to have our energy problem

settled within the local universe; I am picturing artificial life that 

doesn't. And such life, in fact, may not recognize energy as a category 

at all, except for local conservations. I think this would vastly change 

the appearance of entropy, and hence, information, by the way - does any- 

one who knows these mathematical formulations (better than I certainly), 

have any ideas on this?
