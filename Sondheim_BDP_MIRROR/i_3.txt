The _That_ (a poor text but one that leads to something finer)





The machine as painting: There is always the need to rely on the contin-

gent: in painting, it's the plane of the canvas itself, including the 

material support; in music, it is in general the twelve tones of the 

octave. Not that these are inviolate; as the century winds down, they 

have been abandoned as absolute stands. But they remain (just as the

vessel remains for the ceramicist) as a given, tying the body in parti-

cular ways to the medium which harbors history as ultimate restraint.



Tied to the computer, to the qwerty keyboard, to the necessity of using

_this_ particular language and alphabet, I wind my way through the city

flaneur-style, but with always already additional requirements - now

here in Dean and Deluca's, where many famous meetings have occurred, held

taut by the computer battery, itself winding its way to exhaustion. Is 

this the beginning of a primitive conjuncture of language/body and flesh

held taut within its presence? My claws press keys, press surfaces from

which the savannah is gone forever; this is a symbolic life-form, exist-

ing on another plane altogether.



There is always a form of restraint in communication - it's the restraint

which clears the noise from the message, redirects code into redundency.

The machine is a painting because the machine is tied to a vocabulary of

representation, always already; one works with the _that_ which parallels

science and technology as a _that_ in relation to the real. But then I

believe not so much in anarchy/conventionalism, but instead in a core-

theoretical approach - that the real has gristle, and a fairly specific

one at that - the gristle articulating the movement of the bones which

constitutes code...
