Test Text for Lao Ascii Editor Cu-Writer 1.5


If I begin to write in such a manner
In older version of Thailand's early editor
What first becomes of lines' strange starting symbols
Occluding lower ascii with untoward strange symbols
Harboring the need for replace, keep writing onward
Beyond the start of things in those long awful nights
When language spills across the dawning internet
Where you are from where I am but now in black and white
I struggle through these older versions on the way to color
Or the way to broad daylight when leaves are black and red
Sky green against a blue and setting sun
With keywords fluttered in the air like musk
For each and every saying where worlds are born anew;
Thus if I begin to write in such a manner
It is for test of lines' strange starting symbols
Bringing the poem to test, delete, replace and early roost
Where there's no dawns, no worlds, no meaning, nothing.
