REMOTE HEARING


MUSIC IMPROVISATION from NEW LANGUAGES

Listen and download at: http://newlanguages.org/remote-hearing

Remote Hearing is a series of distributed concerts taking place
in locations around the world at predetermined times. In each
installment we invite a group of creative musicians to play
together with mindfulness towards the others, wherever they may
be. The music in its totality is only heard after the fact, a
testament to the historical contingency of that moment. *

blanked

http://www.alansondheim.org/blanked.png

cyberspace, they twist and turn, strike out with eyes blanked 
from too so that from the plain, one gathers beads into heaps. 
the heaps are separated by blanked space, the ground-state. 
think of it as the basin in bon religion, or kristevan chora. 
theresa worked went into an asylum. this, dates, blanked 
memories. golden hair. memories are like this, vague dates, 
worried and blanked memories. i separated by blanked space, the 
ground-state; this an asylum. all my memories are like this, 
vague dates, worried and blanked

from one true world to this, her screen now blanked the woman 
has left the room, her chair, computer vacated, blanked, dark. 
effusion of the blanked and blanking shell turned to hurricanes 
and winds slates of peoples passing by, peripheral glances, 
blanked exteriors azure to me as local suffusion, blanked stares 
against enraptured, i'd say by blanked space, nothing - but here 
- there's a moment of parallel - we grasp each other furiously, 
our eyes not yet blanked out. we live with your many lovers, 
eyes blanked plates of deserted meals. i beg you, these my 
memories are like this, vague dates, worried and blanked 
memories. all my memories are like this, vague dates, worried

infinite war

http://www.alansondheim.org/infinitewar.mp4

the news grows worse every day. the war is infinite, against 
women, children, religions, nations, races, anything one might 
imagine. everything hurtles towards conflicting inerrancies, 
with no way out. like everyone, we're horrified, we don't 
sleep, we dream we have nothing to fear. we fear everything, 
we have no solutions. our bodies are torn apart, our bodies 
are safe. praying for solution is praying for the annihilation 
of the other. our nights are paved with screams and the 
intolerable falling of bodies into dissolution. we can't 
protest, we protest, we shudder, we work day by day, we put 
these things up. but there is infinite war and infinite war 
and torture doesn't take a night off, doesn't take a day.

in the desert, screentests
in the desert, screening, wandering, wanton 
wanton, in the desert, the deserted screentests
they are star and earth, wayward they are, wanton
they swallow earth they are screen,
they are testing screen
wanton they are, they follow star,
deserted, they follow screen


the literature stops when the dead arise
when nothing is seen for their eyes
the language stops when the dead surmise
nothing beyond behind their eyes
the dead shall stop the verb arise
when the noun seeks the body's eyes
what stops the road along them plies
the world was given to their eyes

absolute music and its structures

http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/mississi11.jpg

http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/abs1.mp3 (qin)
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/abs1b.mp3 (qin)
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/noyzworld.mp3 (ambient)
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/noyzworldb.mp3 (ambient)

i dreamed of this, literally. the qin sounds notes in
succession; the background is raised through hard
limiting after the notes die out. one string after
enough... a second run-through uses hiss reduction
to bring out the entangled qin and ambient structure.

in the second two files, the ambient structure appears
alone; a second run-through uses the same hiss 
reduction.

the second and fourth are oddly beautiful, revealing
details of a sonic world i had not imagined. the first
and third present the expenditures and economy of that
world. 

the qin was chosen because of its cosmological role,
somewhat duplicated in the system of natural intervals
reflecting one mode of thinking through the universe,
parsing the affairs of organisms and atmosphere. the
affairs of the world are the affairs of the qin, and
the affairs of the qin are the affairs of the world.

what is entangled is inextricable.

Atavistic Virtuosity, Pleynt of

*/On the other hand, another great review of Avatar Woman -
http://aural-innovations.com/blog/2014/06/azure-carter-alan-sondheim-avatar-women-public-eyesore-2014-pe123-cd/
/*

Recently I've realized that what I do musically - playing varied 
acoustic instruments (mainly bowed/plucked strings, etc.) - is a 
useless skill; it's not even a question of whether the music is 
'good' or not, however defined. I have to constantly repair 
things, practice daily, record almost daily, put the results 
online (or no one will hear them), etc. The instruments creak at 
night; humidity and temperature get to them. No one is really 
interested in the stuff and I'm working, I realized, from an 
older model of music/sound production where virtuosity (think 
Bird, Segovia, Bailey) was rewarded or admired, where this sort 
of music mattered, at least to a small audience. Now I sit here 
in my room (in much the same position that my hateful father 
sat, reading away), playing music without purpose; for me, an 
audience has always been critical, part of a sonic community (to 
borrow from Jackson Moore) that cared about these things, that 
embedded these things in a living and vibrant culture. Obviously 
that's no longer the case. I keep thinking for example I should 
get rid of my instruments, except for a guitar, qin, and oud, 
and let what I've considered 'the practice' go. What else is 
there to do? Working in a discarded medium places me on the edge 
of sanity, as if I found it valuable to work on trigonometic 
proofs - within a field or domain already closed. Now I have to 
think, how to trade these in? For what? What to do? None of this 
is valued in Providence of course; it's valued in NY, which 
brings up the interesting situation what I'd have to be able to 
move back to the city for a kind of semantics to right itself, 
albeit at the mercy of a class we can't afford to buy into. 
Already I have gigabytes of music/sound up at the ESPdisk site, 
as well as my own website - the latter is commercial and will of 
course disappear, and the former will probably not last that 
long as well. Then what? The air burns, the instruments are 
silent. I'd return them to their native countries, if I could; 
in the meantime it feels as if my own talent, such as it is or 
isn't, burns as well.
