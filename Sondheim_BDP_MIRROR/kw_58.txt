it's a dirty hole that the loft has become in my mind, teetering between a
perfect refusal of beauty in escapades to the elements and the detritus of
the decay of teeth and gums rubbed against those elements of the curb
heading towards illness. what a home is, space that is thoughtless and of
perfect transparency, the bone of the body. what is here, the exposure of
the tumor which, for one last fling, that decay within the brick itself,
is a declaration of buildings falling down, a category or synopsis. in
cyberspace one might have erasure, sudden disappearance of a database:
there you go, there's nothing to hold onto. yesterday, they said, don't
bother with the door and hallway, the door won't be there. i said, well,
people might hide in the hallway. they said, don't worry, there won't be 
a hallway either.
