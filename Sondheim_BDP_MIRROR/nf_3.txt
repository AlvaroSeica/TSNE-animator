The Opera series of the movement-moment of the Diva

A series of still images remade on the Zaurus from already issued images 
in the http://www.asondheim.org/portal/.nikuko directory.

These are reformed in the http://www.asondheim.org/portal/ directory as 
Opera png & jpeg, 22 in all, ordered in terms of broadcast and 
disturbance.

What can I say beyond the Victor Frankenstein of my dreams watching his 
creature at the edge of the ice, expiring first, the creature tending 
towards self-immolation, the incandescent symbol reminiscent of Flaubert's 
St-Antoine at the beginning and end of his salvation.

All these males, Elizabeth already on the pyre, everyone ready for a good 
time. At the Zaurus prompt, it's like the Image Magick prompt, it's like 
the stage prompt, the proscenium shuddering furiously in its tendency 
towards distance. People are so small here shuddering.

BOOK REVIEWS


These are books I have been working with recently; I recommend all of 
them.

First TECH:

Amazon Hacks, 100 Industrial-Strength Tips & Tools, Paul Bausch, O'Reilly.
This book follows on Google Hacks - there is now a series of Hacks works in 
progress. Amazon Hacks is useful, not only for buying and selling, but for 
the model of commerce it presents in detail. As a voracious reader, I plan 
to use the book in selling some books - only in order to buy others of 
course. The chapter sections include Browsing and Searching; Controlling 
your Information; Participating in the Amazon Community; Selling Through 
Amazon; Associates Program; and Amazon Web Services. I requested the book 
as a review copy.

Windows XP Unwired, A Guide for the Home, Office, and the Road, Wei-Ming 
Lee, O'Reilly. This book fills a large gap in my library; I don't 
understand WiFi that well, and this is enormously useful, WinXP or not. 
There are case studies, coverage of infrared and Bluetooth, etc. I've 
needed this work. It accompanies The Wireless Networking Starter Kit, The 
practical guide to Wi-Fi networks for Windows and Macintosh, Adam Engst 
and Glenn Fleishman, Peachpit Press. I'd still like to know why tmobile 
goes out every so often on the Zaurus, the details of Wep (which I can 
find online), but both of these manuals cover the field for someone just 
wanting to get on, wardrive, transfer/transfer/transfer, and so forth.

Two more tech books:

Google Pocket Guide, Tara Calishain, Rael Dornfest, DJ Adams - this is 
fine, not nearly as detailed as Google Hacking, but quite useful for 
someone who isn't that interested in programming with the Web API. (This 
is also a requested book.)

The Official Blender Gamekit, Interactive 3d for Artists, Ton Roosendaal
and Carsten Wartmann, Blender. I just ordered this; it comes with Blender
Creator, and 10 sample games - all of which can be modified. I'm really
excited about playing around with this. The Publisher version is 2.24;  
Blender is moving towards 3.0 and a new gamekit, so this was on sale ($35
US). What can I say? I love Blender, its small footprint, quirkiness,
ability for fast-fast modeling (as long as it isn't human!), and so 
forth. It's one of the few programs that have let me constantly amaze 
myself. You should have some knowledge of Blender itself before using this 
book, but there is an introduction in it, and it does come with the 2.28 
version.

Onto other work:

Hacker Culture, Douglas_Thomas, Minnesota. I love this book; it's the best 
analysis of the title concept I've seen (although Levy's Hackers runs a 
close second, as old as it is). It's not based on tech or exploits, but on 
analysis from within and without - internal phenomenology of hacking and 
hacking communities, and cultural studies analysis of the reception of 
hacking etc. within the social - ranging from film to legislation. The 
sections follow suit: The Evolution of the Hacker; Hacking 
Representation; and Hacking Law. There are sections on Phrack and the 
"Hacker Manifesto" - I couldn't ask for better. The epilogue goes over 
Mitnick/Lamprecht. I recommend this book to everyone interested in 
computer culture.

A Mind So Rare, The Evolution of Human Consciousness, Merlin Donald, 
Norton. I'd read and loved his Origins of the Modern Mind - and mind you, 
I'm very wary of titles like these - but the books are exceptional, and 
offer a foundation for thinking about mind in relation to the external 
world - ranging from hammers to computers, digging to databanks. (I had to 
try at the alliteration.) David Antin mentioned A Mind So Rare to me; I 
hadn't known about it. Antin's recommendation is _always_ worthwhile; I'd 
argue this book is a necessity in thinking through the philosophy of 
information, philosophy of consciousness, cog psy, and so forth.

Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace; and The Future of Ideas, The Fate of 
the Commons in a Connected World, Lawrence Lessig, Basic Books and Random 
House. Both of these books are exciting - they deal with code, 
legislation, community, the "commons," and other issues relevant to the 
present and future of the Net. Now that we have 30 billion spams a day - 
over 60% of all email - the issues he discusses are absolutely crucial.
I would also advise _everyone_ to join the Nettime email list, which 
discusses cultural/political issues; Lessig has been one of a number of 
reference points.

Snap To Grid, A User's Guide to Digital Arts, Media, and Cultures, MIT,
Peter Lunenfeld - one of the most intelligent books I've seen on digital
aesthetics. From Stelarc to jodi to listservs, the work is an immensely
valuable guide and analysis of the digital domain. It's already 2 years
old, but doesn't seem dated - but then perhaps the 'classic' era of
digital art/media is already past.

Collective Intelligence, Mankind's Emerging World in Cyberspace, Plenum. 
Post Deleuze/Guattari/Fuller/perhaps de Chardin visionary - irritating 
like the Krokers can be irritating (well, not _that_ irritating) but 
exciting at the same time; it gives some sort of distant spirituality or 
otherness to what we're doing at the moment. Makes me feel good and the 
analysis is fascinating.

Some other work I'm reading at the moment:

The History of the Calculus and its Conceptual Development, Carl Boyer, 
quite quite old Dover book, but for me really useful in thinking about the 
ontology of infinitesimals and the continuum. It does come before 
Robinson's work on infinitesimals, so its development is classic, but 
extremely detailed.

Opal, A Life of Enchantment, Mystery, and Madness, Katherine Beck, Viking, 
which just came out. If you haven't read the work of Opal Whiteley, you 
should; it's almost unbelievable - I'd recommend Hoff's edition of the 
Mystical Nature Diary. Her work and life have been crucial for my own 
thinking of the natural world and issues of naming - even though the Diary 
was written by and large when Whiteley was 6. (No, I'm not exaggerating.)

Frankenstein, Mary Shelley. I'd never read this before and was astonished 
at the incandescence of the writing and the fulfillment of romantic 
destiny - it is _nothing_ like any of the popularizations I've seen.

Studies in Chinese Folklore and Related Essays, Wolfram Eberhard, Indiana, 
1970. This is wonderful; there are translations of pounding songs, 
children's essays, poems scrawled on walls. I haven't seen any of this 
literature before, and the Eighteen Short Men, Eighteen Red Men, etc. 
pounding songs are amazing. I'm always excited when new domains open up in 
the world and suddenly one is born anew - it's like that.

Saving the Image, Art after Film, Tanya Leighton and Pavel Buchler, 
editors, CCA/MMU, complete with a long essay by Tom Zummer among others 
(Laura Mulvey, Chrissie Myles, John Waters, etc.). I just received this 
(from Tom; I'm mentioned in his essay), but the issue is an important one 
to many of us who have moved from film's physicality through video's 
mechanisms to flash memory, packets, and the electromagnetic spectrum.

The Medieval Castle, Life in a Fortress in Peace and War, Warner, Penguin 
- if you're interested in the theme, and I am.

Montaigne and Melancholy, The Wisdom of the Essays, M.A. Screech. I've 
always liked the Essays; this book transforms them in relation to theory 
of body, ecstasy, self, and melancholy itself. I'm rarely interested in 
litcrit, but this work is rather amazing, opening up new territories of 
the text. Rather old, 1983, republished with new intro by Penguin in 1991.

Of course if you haven't looked at Wolfram's A New Kind of Science (there
was also a great review of this in Dr Dobbs a while ago) - please please
do - the paradigm is easy to understand, the writing lucid, examples
exciting, programming somewhat easy if you want to go that way, and the
weight of the thing will make a great doorstop.

I've also been reading the poetry of Nada Gordon on and off for months 
now, and really love the intensity, interstitial writing, and sheer 
quality of language. Just thought I'd mention it.

Also:

The Selected Prose of Fernando Pessoa; some books on Korean for tourists; 
Sibley's guides to birds and bird behavior; Heisenberg's The Physical 
Principles of the Quantum Theory; the most recent Sara Paretsky novel, 
Blacklist, more of Shelley, Mary Shelley's notebooks...


- I've wanted to cover a lot of this territory, particularly the opening 
technical works, for a long time. Hope this at least interests you.

- Alan

k.mov "silent movie"


http://www.asondheim.org/portal/.nikuko/k.mov == silent movie of grandeur
and civilization, desire and fear. set to repeat/loop. azure carter and
alan sondheim, two rooms on dean street. set to black background.

now with code, architecture against body and its dissolution in time.

there must be a name to k.mov? perhaps "silent movie" - proscenium

under the control

tried to get off welbutrin which i took on my own, lexapro as well, the
other twisted molecule from celexa, the last taken after the debacle in
miami. so i stopped the first and went through a couple of sleepless
nights and shakiness., the days were filled with exhaustion, i couldn't
move, my work was an afterthought which kept pouring itself out in spite
of my mind's uneasy clawings. after that i gave up on the lexapro as well,
cold turkey, and then the shakes began, something that shouldn't have
happened after this drug, which has me in its unholy grasp. i found anger
welling up, rising to the surface, my existence a pure fury against my
situation and all that it entailed. the fury led me to push everyone
around me to the limits, there was no going back, nothing from the path
bringing the wonder of despair home again. i began to get dizzy, and
dizziness took hold of me, i'd stop in the middle of the sidewalk losing
consciousness, holding on to azure as if my life depended on it, which it
did. i couldn't work or worked rather in a trance and the production, more
distant than ever, continued as i found myself more and more sexually
aroused, stripping everything bare between us, my consciousness the first
to go. i was shattered, i'd go to sleep around ten, only to wake for hours
in the middle of the night, as now, when my hormonal rhythms are still
screaming and stressed out muscles tense to the breaking point. i was
never awake and never asleep, i could barely keep myself upright with
these spells or swoons as i began to think of them, a latter-day
neurasthenia haunting me as the world swayed and rippled. azure was going
through other trials and tribulations, i found i couldn't help her, both
of us swimming to the bottom of the airless grotto, gasping for breath,
screamed drowned in the screams of others. down there i meandered, my fury
reaching new heights, terrifying me, an enormous depression past despair
waiting at the suicidal door. for once it wasn't easy to lie within the
old familiar feelings of the down world, new gates and portals were giving
way exposing raw skin, nerves, unknown tissues for unknown purposes, each
of them blistered in the salt, some dull monster emerging. i gave up,
reached for the pill, the ultimate stage of the addict, after four or five
days of this, living off the chemistry once again. one wasn't enough, a
second that night, the promise and premise of a third, a fourth, the 
continuity of a functioning mind not quite my own, the turn towards a 
different kind of somnolence, all questions turned problematic with 
dulled belief in the possibilities of answers, answers linked in ragged 
nets to questions in the salt air above the ocean of truth precisely 
because of its lack of limitations. now i'm a re-covering addict, the 
addiction to lexapro forming the hunger in my mind, the welbutrin long 
lost and unmissed, expose of another chemical landscape. i couldn't manage 
both, i recognize the stress and most likely shortened arc of the madness 
of my life, i continue exhaling the language of description, the paste 
over the substance of the real, the substrate over the substance. a little 
while ago i was sleeping, something uncanny woke me, and i'm again here, 
the dizziness a slight new turn of events, writing this down before it 
gets lost like so many other texts expelled from the surface of my mind. i 
tend myself, i tend myself constantly, words flourish in spite of the 
onslaught of the casualty of the brain. i'm at the tip of the flame, the 
bottom of the chasm, salt burns my wounds, soaks the oils from the skin, 
fills the pen, makes thoughts rise. i'd rather fight the mind than the 
brain, i'd say i'm back, but for how long before some new addiction makes 
itself manifest, something keeping me on track and the track a little 
longer.
