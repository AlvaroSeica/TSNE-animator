Sleeplessness


I.lie.down.barren.for.fifteen.minutes,.it.turns.towards.an.hour.and.a
quarter;.there.is.a.train,.a.suitcase.of.the.Spice.Girls'.clothing.flies
off,.only.to.be.picked.up.by.Mark.who.gives.it.to.me,.what.can.I.do.with
these.dresses.and.sequins?.Sleep.ten.more.minutes,.the.computer.is.off.at
the.far.side.of.a.darkened.enormous.loft;.I.play.the.keys.from.a.distance
and.beauty,.thin.circles.of.light.like.crescent.moons.on.the.dead.screen.

But.I'm.dead.in.the.waters.here,.sleep.so.deep.it.does.violence,.at.least
twelve.to.fourteen.hours.a.day,.depression.sliding.down.the.walls.during.
the.remainder,.the.loft.heated with violent images, wall-oozings, arms and
legs, there are teeth in the corners of the ceilings, there are iron bars
against the flesh where the walls join the ceilings, there are screaming
mouths where the floors join the walls, there are tongues and poisons out-
side the windows, there is skin on the windows, it sends me a message, it
is one skin, all those window-skins, they're "connected," I think this is
a miracle, one-window skin, it's bleeding, then there is ink on the sills
spelling my name Nicky Nicky Nicky.

One skin really is a miracle. (I'm sorry about the quotation marks.)

I have only one name now and it is a very tired name, all worn out, and I
am waking up more and more, shuddering, crying, struggling enough over to
the laptop which is on right next to the television, so I don't have to
concentrate on either, and I am wearing this beautiful dress, I don't know
where it came from.
