sheen (of philosophy)


brick-dust, plaster-dust, you can't mop what turns hard
wetted down becoming what it's supposed to do -
so it's hard, everything is like that, a floor or foundation
for all my precious work. oh hard white surface -
i can't write or do anything upon you, you gum up my works,
collected. see, it's a siege here, walls coming down, 
nothing coming out, right. but it won't burn so when
i fire this place up and down, a thin shell, glue-like
holds my brains in what remains -

there might be a metaphor in this/that of the building's
collapse/rebirth and foundations turned new once again -
taking with the process everything of memory, technology,
dust computers' foes. but just that, it'd
take violent rocks hammered into violent faces, to write
it all down, to the foundations, where writing is, not on 
water, but gummed up, pen stuck up fast in concrete,
takes a queen to pull it out -

but this, philosophy is like an architecture, philosophy's 
like anarchitecture, oh house of many rooms all flooded, 
soaked by plumbing gone awry. or never upper ceilings, 
basements all the way upside-down back into them, 
nothing's ever clean, or usable, "building takes up all 
his time" -
- the cause "she's a builder born"
