GROTTO



[This simple program generates shapes reminiscent of abstract back-

grounds in the Tun-Huang Frescos; for me, it also represents an arche-

typal cyberspace, the first pictures coming through the line, from 

the brain to the mind, from the terminal screen through terminal 

velocity, to the brain. The images never repeat and the random seed

is tied to a seconds-after-midnight function. The program is of some

limited mathematical interest as well, being a continuously nested

recursion which is semi-fractal at best. (This is my favorite image-

generation program, by the way, using a "lean" script.)]



Grotto Program



This is a qbasic program that will run on a 386 or better VHA or SVGA

monitor; you should have at least 25Mhz speed. To run this, save every-

thing below the dotted line as a file in DOS called "GROTTO.BAS" (The

program uses Screen 12 in qbasic.)



To run from qbasic: Type at the Dos prompt: qbasic /run grotto.bas

The program runs until stopped. To stop, enter control-break, which

brings the program up. Then exit the program as you would any DOS file,

by typing Alt-File x (for exit).



You can also create a small batch file with the editor by typing

cd/dos

qbasic /run grotto.bas

into a file called "grotto.bat"

Then at the DOS prompt, anywhere, just type "grotto" and the program 

begins.



The program will generate new forms continually until cancelled. (For 

those who care, sin/cos was used in place of tan because the latter 

generates overflow.)



This program may be distributed as freeware anywhere accompanied by the 

author's name.
