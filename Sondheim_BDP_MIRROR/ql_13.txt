1. presence of flesh. Investing in playing a physical instrument of the 
traditional type involves thinking through the presence of flesh. Playing 
string instruments for example results in constant manicuring: nails, 
skin, and muscle are shaped, exercised, and controlled, as much as 
possible, using operations that seem efficacious. Work-arounds, kludges, 
are also cultivated so that, for example, if a nail splits or muscles 
cramp, other means of continuing play are available. One is never far from 
the flesh, which asserts itself during production. (The production perhaps 
is also the production of flesh, of a certain inscribing of flesh.)
