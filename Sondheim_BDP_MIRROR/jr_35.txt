(From Oswald O.)

I'm sitting here in tshirt and pants, worrying about a future in death
And hackers screwing up my system and my arms and legs leprosy and lies
So there's nowhere to go but into machines and I've lost the will to live
Which is why I say in the middle of the night thank god for the rain

And the flowers are dying in roadside Amerika and no one's around to
collect
And rainbows are yearning while cities are burning and children are dead
from neglect
The war's hardly over, girls lie down in clover, scream and they never get
up
It's time for the magic, the reaper wrecks havoc, it's time for the
gallows and cup

I'm sitting here in combat and drinking long gone brew of blood and wine
And you might think it's fine and that we're walking the party line
But the sides are smashed with needles and vials and vile's the weather
today
So thank God for the pounding on windows and roof thank God for the
nighttime rain

And she offers me water, she offers me wine, she offers her body as well
Cause she knows I've returned, whole villages burned, I've been through
the weather of hell
The war's just begin, there's blood on the sun, there's blood on the
harvest moon
And I'm throwing the cards, hanged men and hanged girls, they're sowing
another rune

And you might think I'm dressed in armor, leaning down from the pulpit for
cards
But I've wounded myself, I've lost my way, in the woods where the runes
send off sparks
And flames reach for the skies, they cover her thighs, the runes scream,
they're burning bright
She buries herself in my burning flesh, thank God for the storm and the
rain

Pattie Hearst walks again with the strong Weathermen, Black Panthers are
loading their guns
Em-Sixteens are ready, our bodies are steady, we're off to the hills at a
run
Lord Jesus will keep us, Death will not reap us, revenge is the truth of
the day
And nighttime will hide us, the ghetto abide us, we're waiting to kill and
to pray

And you'll find me here in bluejeans and tshirt, roaring down the wires at
you,
You'll see me in the flaming sky, holy embrace with Janis and Jimmie and
The Owl
Pure windows opened up flaming skulls where we'll take the boat to Nam's
pure booty hell
And celebrate our love beyond your cracked dull thought, and thank God for
the thunder and rain

And the flowers are dying in roadside Amerika and no one's around to
collect
And rainbows are yearning while cities are burning and children are dead
from neglect
The war's hardly over, girls lie down in clover, scream and they never get
up
It's time for the magic, the reaper wrecks havoc, it's time for the
gallows and cup

And thank god for the thunder and rain
