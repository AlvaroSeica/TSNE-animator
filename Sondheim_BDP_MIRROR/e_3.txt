Errors!


Oh, I have made so many of them! And I've seen them of my ways! Is there 
anything more to say than "I've made mistakes!"?

I've started to realize... I'm so sorry... My apologies... I've started 
to realize...

That the center no longer holds! Guess what! That cyberspace isn't real
after all! Woosh woosh (as my friend Mayakovsky once said to me),
nothing's here! It's just an illusion, like any naive theory - the way
things look makes it seem as if I could reach out and touch you! Hah! 

The truth is, you're reading dead words on a dead screen, and there's 
nothing more to it - it's like any other philosophy. And the truth is: 
I'll never hear from you again!

But there's more to say, you say, wherever you are: Isn't it a question 
of who's saying it? (Not who's saying what, which is another question 
altogether!) And the screen looks like any book (I've made mistakes!), 
blanking us out; no one for a moment would think a book is real! Only 
_you_ can tell me what you're feeling here, and of what philosophical 
import is that? Writing this, I don't hear or see you;  you're nowhere 
around - later, you'll have all the attention in the world! 

Or will you? Like Dostoevsky's hero, I'm a sick man! I've got something 
wrong with my liver! Surely you believe me! I rail against two plus two 
is five! I'm absurd! I'm the last railer!

But I'm _sure_ I've made mistakes and this space is just a place of 
scribbling, nothing much! So I apologize, I'm sorry, I really am! Forgive 
me! I grovel at your feet!
