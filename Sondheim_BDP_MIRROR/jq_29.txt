HTML-BODY: Explanation

<!--Alan writes his desires; Jennifer receives the page--><BR>
<!--Agreeable Alan dreams his way across Jennifer--><BR>
<!--Writing, punctuated by warnings, corrupts his body--><BR>
<!--"You are ALL TEXT," Jennifer says--><BR>
<!--"There's nothing to me," Agreeable Alan--><BR>

Another experiment in wryting the html body, exp.htm uses _alert_ buttons
among the viewer, "Jennifer," and "Alan"; links and targets simply shudder
the page slightly, as if a tremor went through the body. Certain links
leave text altogether, sink to the lower and blank margins of the page, a
non-inscriptive ground, divided by a series of horizontal lines / plateaus
from the body of the text. And the body itself turns on the phrase "you
spread me on your screen," like jelly, like jam, like roadkill or sexual
arousal - a phrase which appears through the majority of alerts. 

The mouse moves across the field, stumbling over the poor simulacrum of
skin, the body with organs (BWO), javascript, html, tcp/ip. One _enters_
the text, alerts protrude, freeze the body until cancelled. And as for the
rest? The surface? Speaking less than the interior, but hardly less intel-
ligent or inscribed; the surface in fact is an intelligent surface, blank
of image, refusing to give way _beneath._

Because of the nature of email lists, these accounts have used at most two
text files; other html-body-works here, it can only be noted, use up to 35
files, border on obscenity, and can't be introduced here. It is not that I
desire blind-html, imageless, text-hysteric; it's that there is an addi-
tional dialog, with email, that reconstructs the possible.
