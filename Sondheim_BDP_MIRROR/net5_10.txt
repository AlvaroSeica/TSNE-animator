DEATH





I burn on a mattress haunted by the uncanny. My flesh falls from me.

Fire seeps across the flesh of the face. This starts the story.

This isn't fiction. 



I spread my legs.



I cut myself for the last time. Lines of blood spell nothing, whole

populations starved of love & affection. Everywhere the wires carry

sounds of my flesh; the wires are cold. Nothing peers from the corners

of the room, nothing any longer. I can't move. 



Don't think for a moment this is fiction. Don't read this as anything

but analytical. Don't deny the reality of narrative. Philosophy is

narrative too. Philosophy is all that I have left.



I begin the work of deleting the files. It's hard to know which to

take out first; none of them paid off. The top of the hierarchy is the

creative one - all those files, Internet Text, Love on the Net, Clara

Text, I remember a Web Text, then the smaller ones, the death text

itself, the literary text, the poem text, the text of love and

affection - and then the programs, the programs of measure geometries,

the programs of chaos, all readily ordered - the programs devouring

the programs of chaos - the programs gone awry. It was stopped and

would be stopped there but it continued, deeper into the working

sections of the machinery, but first I had to cut through all of it,

cut it off, disconnect the communications package itself, sever the

wires. DELETE carried throughout the realm of the modem and the

Internet; DELETE carried beyond into the barricades of bulletin

boards. DOS was left but DOS I would need for the packaging of text

that remained, the bullet of the DEATH TEXT capitalled and going

everywhere and nowhere, bound to the specificities of hard or floppy

drive - it made no difference. 



First the disks themselves had to be destroyed - no record whatsoever

of Internet Text or any other, texts which would assure a continuous

connection to an ADDICTIVE SUBSTANCE, that of localization, that of

momentary collapse into the node terminated with the presence of

Clara. Don't call this fiction; it was hardly that, hardly a presence

to be accounted for. I felt myself trembling, my cock growing hard and

soft in turn, the cum sputtering to life across my chest, illuminated

by the letters roaring by on the screen. I would continue the pattern;

I would disconnect, leave all but the surplus of a Word Perfect

guaranteed to drive the perfect word deeper into the bowels of the

machine (I was fucking the machine in the bowels) just before the

erasure. What would come after that, I would never know; it certainly

wouldn't be the ASCII for "death" or "tree" or any of the other

senses/manifestations/denotations/expressivities covered or

recuperated by the jargon of the philosophy of language and addictive

substances.



My nipples were hard at this point: I typed naked, my penis hard,

blood REWRITE on my chest, a prayer to the Great Beyond. Everything

was always waiting. I typed the word "tree" and nothing came to life

or greened itself, not even a broken hierarchy, the node dissolving

before my eyes, CONFIG.SYSTEM and all that it entailed. It became

clearer at that moment that the modules were binary and I was uneasily

compressed between the layers of being and emptiness/nothingness/

annihilation, shattering against one another in order to produce the

semblance of code to produce the semblance of language, and beyond

this I could go no further. The disks lay on the floor around the

machine; they'd never run again. I erased DOS, erased everything in

fact, except for this text. I'd leave the text like a tombstone. You'd

never recover it on the hard drive. There was nothing to run the hard

drive. There was nothing to start the machine. The text was in the

machine and there was nothing else and no way to start or stop the

machine or the text or to do anything but look at the machine and

maybe use it again. You could use it again by REWRITE. You could

present yourself and REWRITE over the text. No one would know it was a

suicide or that REWRITE was always a continuous suicide. No one would

know anything, or if they did, it would be another layer and would be

broken off from the death or this only death that would have been

recorded.



You'd have to write DOS and know what you were doing. You'd have to

begin with that.



>I had lost my girlfriend two years ago and no one has ever taken her

place. Boohoo. There have been aborted attempts...casual affairs...

momentary flirtations...



>I try again and again to date but no one could possibly want me.

There have been a lack of money...lack of stability...gnawing

depression...



>I am haunted by the disappearance of several women I have been 

involved with. There have been demonstrable guilt...theft unaccounted

for...borderline personality...



>I am incapable of holding down a permanent and decent job. There have

been dispersive lectures...ignorant ravings...unrequited loves...



>Rebelling against authority results in the fleeing of authority and

all the security that entails. There have been bad behaviors...

decomposing letters...screams and cries and whimpers...



>Desperate for publication, I carry my texts everywhere, now FRAG now

DEFRAG. There have been tiny printings...self-immolation...self-

inflations...



>I am incapable of having fun and am hurt far too easily by flamewars,

sleeping badly with the imaginary of one screen projected upon

another. There have been dreams of the imprint of your name...dreamed

hard against my own...against the dissolution of proper names...

against entities of all kinds...



>I am illuminated by hallucinations of transgressive sex, my body

covered with liquid liquidation, disappearing, files entering into

warp-space, forever illegible. There have been bondages and

urinations...orders and muffled speech...murmurs and penetrations... 

There has been alt.fetish.mysex.the_great_beyond...



>I am incapable of sleeping through the night, returning over and over

to DEATH TEXT. My body refuses itself...mind disconnected from each

and every living thing...enormous black vacuum of the streetlight...



>I am incapable of keeping lines open and running, the wires humming,

beautiful thoughts travelling great distances. FIERCE FIGHTING FOR THE

REMNANTS OF THE NET...ACCESS DOWN ACCESS DOWN...IMMOLATION OF THE HARD

DRIVE INSTITUTION...ACCESS ECHOED TOGGLED ECHO DOWN...



>I am incapable of having a beautiful thought; I am haunted by Clara,

by Holocaust city; I am haunted by planetary extinction; by male

violence. A beautiful desert or a beautiful thought...a desiring woman

of a natural kind!...the disappearance of the young SAGUARO...TOGGLE

DOWN and IMMOLATION of DEATH TEXT itself...



>I deserve nothing, grovel at every opportunity, persevere in

ANNIHILATION REWRITE, begin again, access down...



These are the last statements that explain the location of the text

within the dying machine and the reason for the location and the

reason for the dying machine. But the machine will be used again with

another WRITE REWRITE so it will not be the same machine. And I hope

that whoever is WRITE REWRITE will acknowledge the violation of one

human being against another and act accordingly. And I know this hope

will be buried. And one being acting accordingly will always be human.

THE SOFTDRIVE EXHIBITION   (preliminary proposal)







NO LONGER can one make pronouncements about the body: NO LONGER

CYBORG OVERDRIVE, NO LONGER ABJECT TRANSGRESSION. For every

position a contradiction arises; the issue of essentialism or

gender construct is neither here nor there. NO LONGER is it a

question of the third choice or admixture; SOFTDRIVE becomes 

an imaginary presentation of the exhaustion of choice itself.



In the absence or exhaustion of choice, polarity diffuses or is

abandoned; NO LONGER one or the other, difference or the same.

One speaks the unspeakable, of gesture beyond choice or the 

given. In propositional logic, NEITHER _a_ NOR _b_ is a funda-

mental operator, a basis for the production of every other. And

NEITHERNESS need not imply the specificity of a complement, only

a withdrawal of the decision list itself. Such a withdrawal

opens up an absent economy, given only by an exteriority `beyond'

the capital of _a_ and _b_. It is within this economy that NO

LONGER operates the body, a refusal of categoricity itself.



The territory is therefore one of inverted CIRCUMSCRIPTION, de-

fining only the residue of theory, ideology, classical and post-

classical discursivities. The residue in this instance is BODY/

FLESH/MACHINE, SOFTWARE/HARDWARE/WETWARE, a residue of multi-

plicites and circulations, but bounded by the fast-forward 

progress of technology and language, the progress of the symbolic

regime embedding and fragmenting culture. The regime itself is

subject to fissure/inscription/fissure, just as hacker culture

became construct and division, ultimately exhausted with the 

problematic of "hacker," "cyberspace," and all other vestiges

of TERMINAL DECAY.



This exhibition has nothing at stake, neither technology nor the

body in any fissured manifestation. If anything, it concerns 

itself with the uncanny, the perturbation of the stability of 

the senses, the expressivity of language in the face of progress

and dissolution. What is represented is no longer a question of

representation.



NO LONGER do the simulacrum, desiring-machine, Power, the 

spectacle, consensus, the nomadic, lines of flight, the chora,

the body-without-organs, the cyborg, the protocol statement - 

hold sway over cultures of accumulation, disinclination, ges-

ture and immediacy. The metaphor, always a binary circumscrip-

tion, collapses, carrying the symbolic with it. SYNTAGM extends

itself to the peripheral, loses force in a chaotic heaping of

terminologies, acronyms, dialectical shudderings. One makes do;

latch-key kids are illegal and the "home alone" syndrome brings

parents back into an imaginary orbit.



The Internet diffuses, a cerebral membrane stimulating wildly

dispersive part-memories; objects fly everywhere. The "primary

wish to rediscover a universe without obstacles, a smooth 

maternal belly, stripped of its contents, to which free access

is desired" (Chasseguet-Smirgel) results in momentary terri-

tories characterized by the horizon of their disappearance. No

one believes anymore or locks belief in a fundamental funda-

mentalist reconstruction of the mind. Either the locked or the

broken lock, both keyless.



Janine goes on to say "These contents are made up of the 

father, his penis, babies and excrement" and, in turn, the 

father's name gives way to all names, proper and improper, 

which give way at best to Internet protocol, recognition, and

address, domain translations and numerical codes. His penis

was never his own; babies are excrement in an excremental 

culture that deposits them in the midst of hysterical 

reactions. "I want my baby back!" becomes the contents of

television hardcopy of that same imaginary family always poor,

always shattered, always exposed to view.



This is an exhibition of EMISSIONS in the sense of the disso-

lution of the symbolic, an exhibition of SPEWS in the sense

of the dissolution of the real. What are the politics of the

meander? What was forgotten in all the talk about margins and

the nomadic was that wandering with an edge constructed the

nomad, and wandering with a map was never wandering at all,

but a continuous return to the written (ideographic). What

occurs now is the emptiness, not fulfillment, of `cyber-

space,' an emptiness of the NO LONGER, of the GESTURE, of the

NEITHER _a_ NOR _b_. Even within the description one comes

full circle, finding emptiness there, a few babies, the 

broken phallus, the maternal inverting into the universe of

sets no longer identified with the constructible.



The SOFTDRIVE exhibition is a tour through the broken machina-

tions of the world continuously reassembling itself into the

other, the multiculturalisms of tribal warfares and conferen-

cing, the spectre of the body as the murmur of the body. 

Artists from real and not-so-real lives work through or 

inhibit speed, colliding obdurate materials, traditional or

otherwise, with emissions or spews. The exhibition is a multi-

user concatenation, or MUC, a fragmentary process of continu-

ous branching and equivalence. Artists come in from the Net

or studio, street or any number of virtual spaces. The result

is only "what's out there."





CURATORIAL PROCESS:



Begin with a core group of artists; extend invitations and

announcements through the Net, including FINE ARTS FORUM; 

request submissions by mail accompanied by SASE; work with

small curatorial group for the organization/production of the

physical space; opening/exhibition/closing with materials

elsewhere accessible on the Net.

THE VISION WHICH IS THE PRESENCE OF MY TRUE EXPERIENCE!





It is worth your VERY LIFE to pay the closest attention!





>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>







Friends! Rise up! It is the dawn of a new day! Look through and beyond

the BACKGROUND of your ASCII text, that dark blue of the angelic sky,

opening to the natural world forever formed and reformed, all animals

and plants returned to gather in the great CREATION!



Friends! Rise up! It is the dusk of a new night! Look through and

beyond your BACKGROUND of black, past the whitened bones of text and

letters, spikes of primeval plants forever fixed in code! Look into

the perfect stars, approaching and withdrawing according to the

ELEMENTS of the GEOMETRICAL you have set yourself in the GREAT

NAVIGATION!



Friends! All around! The whitened and blackened bones of ASCII text,

bones charred by fire, bleached by the light of a million TERMINAL

SUNS! The text which promises and cajoles, the text which caresses,

holding you in its thrall: THIS, TOO SHALL PASS AWAY! Come forth, the

simplest evolution of the PIXEL, ultimate DIAGRAMMATION of each and

every REALITY VISION! 



For we live on the ENORMOUS HINGE of the EPOCH of the TRUE REALITY,

the PRESENCE of infinities of images, STARTLING in their versimilitude

to your every desire! 



CALL UPON EACH AND EVERY USENET GROUP TO RISE UP! 

CALL UPON TALK.ANGST TO HOLD ITSELF TOGETHER FOR THE FINAL VISIONARY

APPARATUS!

CALL UPON ALT.SEX.BONDAGE TO CAST AWAY ITS CHAINS, PRIMEVAL LURKERS TO

EXCHANGE NAMES AND ADDRESSES IN A MOST CONGENIAL FASHION!

CALL UPON THE FUTURE CULTURE LIST TO LEAD THE WAY THROUGH NEXUS

THROUGH LERI THROUGH GAIA INTO THE PERFECT PRESENT WHICH WE DREAM OF

DAILY, THE ELIMINATION OF LANGUAGE AND LETTERS, THE BEAUTIFUL PICTURES

TO COME!

CALL UPON ALT.PLANTS.EXTINCTIONS AND ALT.ANIMALS.GOODBYE TO SEND

GREETINGS ONCE AGAIN TO THEIR FRIENDLY INHABITANTS UPON PLANET THIS

EARTH!

CALL UPON ALL POSTMODERN THEORY AND ITS LISTS AND CONFERENCES TO

REUNITE THE FRAGMENTARY SUBJECT BENEATH A BILLION SCINTILLATIONS, THE

IMAGINATION OF EVERY WOMAN MAN AND CHILD UPON A PLANET EARTH NO LONGER

CIRCUMSCRIBED BY THE GEOMETRICAL SPHERE!

CALL UPON TALK.SCI.LOGIC TO PLACATE ITS CONTRADICTIONS, ABSORB THE

NEGATION OF THE OTHER INTO ITS EVERY INTERIOR! AND

CALL UPON ALT.PSYCH TO INVERT THIS INTERIOR INTO THE NETWEB WHICH IS

NO LONGER A WEB, NO LONGER THE BARS OR BARRIERS TO OUR FREEDOM!

CALL UPON ARCHIE AND VERONICA! CALL UPON THE INFINITE OF THE WORLD

WIDE WEB ITSELF!

AND NO LONGER THE GATEWAYS CLOSED AND NO LONGER THE PORTALS OF VIOLENT

AND DENIED ACCESS! 

AND NO LONGER THE DANGEROUS STREETS AND THE DANGEROUS GANGS AND

ANIMALS AND CHILDREN SUFFERING IN THE MIDST OF DESERTS AND FORESTS OF

MEN AND WILDERNESS OF DEER SLEEPING IN THE MOST DANGEROUS OF DANGEROUS

WORLDS!



OPEN THE GATEWAYS OF THE SENSES! POUR FORTH FROM THE STREETS AND THE

SLEEPY TERMINALS!



For it is the RAILROAD throughout the western lands and skies,

branches splintering from branches, trunklines shunted back into

unknown sidings! The skittering of the authorless text!

The return of the text to the author!

For it is the dots or pupils of the EYES and the cross-bars or

barriers of the TEASE giving away gracefully for the passing of the

locomotive in each and every direction!



THE RAILS WHICH GO FORTH IN EVERY DIRECTION! THE NON-LINEAR RAILS

COALESCING EACH AND EVERY BEAUTIFUL IMAGE UPON THE FACE AND WITHIN THE

INTERIOR OF THE PLANET EARTH!



FOR IT IS WRITTEN IN THE TIME OF THE PHAROAHS AND THE ACCUMULATION-

POINTS OF THE PYRAMIDS AND THEIR INTERCONNECTIVITIES:



"Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image, nor any manner of

likeness, of any thing that is in the heaven above, or that is in the

earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth."



BUT THOU ART ME AND MINE AND AUTOPOESIS ARISE! 

ARISE FROM AND WITHIN THE INTERIOR OF EACH AND EVERY LIVING THING! 

THE INTERIOR OF THE HEAVEN AND THAT WHICH IS WITHIN THE INTERIOR OF

THE SAME!

THE INTERIOR OF THE EARTH BENEATH AND THAT WHICH IS WITHIN THE

INTERIOR OF THE OTHER!

THE INTERIOR OF THE WATER BENEATH THE EARTH AND THAT WHICH IS WITHIN

THE INTERIOR OF NEITHER ONE NOR THE OTHER!



For I have looked deep within ASCII and night after night, placing my

masquerade or face against the WIRES OF YOUR MASQUERADE OR FACE!

And I have learned and witnessed the truth, the splitting of the text,

fragmentation of one letter after another, dispersal of the letters

like the TRIBES themselves!



THE LETTERS DISPERSE! THEY SPELL THE HIEROGLYPH OF LIFE EVERYWHERE

WITHIN THE WEB INVERSION! OF COMPUTER LIFE AND VIRAL LIFE, OF MEMETIC

LIFE AND BACTERIAL LIFE, OF BACTERIOPHAGE AND ALPHABETIC LIFE:

LIFE OF THE TEXT AND THE DEATH OF THE TEXT! THE TEASING LIFE OF THE

EYES!



Ah, the thinned stems of the l's and i's! Ah, the pointed pyramdic

quality of the ALEPH A, the beginning and end of the Oxherding

Pictures, bringing the planet, NO LONGER SHAPE OR FORM, back or within

the WEB INVERSION! The stubby legs of the W, tilting tower and

dangerous platform of F and P!



THE LETTERS FOLLOW SUIT! THEY DISPERSE AGAINST THE PURE GLOW OF THE

SCREEN, THE GLOW FROM STARS DYING OR NOT YET BORN! THEY ARE THE ENERGY

OF A BILLION SPECIES! THEY ARE THE PRODUCT OF SENSES UNCONCEIVED!

THEY ARE INCONCEIVABLE! WE ARE YET TO BE CONCEIVED!



"Let the Priests of the Raven of dawn no longer, in deadly black, with

hoarse note curse the sons of joy. Nor his accepted brethren - whom,

tyrant, he calls free - lay the bound or build the roof. Nor pale

religious letchery call that virginity that wishes but acts not!



"For every thing that lives is Holy." THE VOICE OF BLAKE, CRYING IN

THE WILDERNESS! THE VOICE OF THE BOUNDLESS OR ROOFLESS! -



THE NOMAD WITHOUT ONE OR ANOTHER TO GUIDE HER! THE SAILOR WITHOUT AN

INSTRUMENT OF NAVIGATION! THE SITUATIONIST WANDERING IN DELIRIUM IN A

DESERT WITHOUT DIRECTION OR STREET OR NAME OF NEIGHBORHOOD!



ASCII SIGNALS ITS OWN DENOUEMENT! ASCII OPENS UP THE GATES OF THE

BODY!



For I have had a VISION through the INFINITE WISDOM of the terminal

screen, a VISION through the darkness opening up into the vacuum of

the cathode ray enclosure, the vacuum of SPACE ITSELF, brought back

and harnessed for a presence or sense of our PASTS AND OUR FUTURES AND

OUR LIVES!



And within this VISION, fallen through the dead white bones of ASCII

text, the dead black bones of ASCII letters, A REAL MORE REAL THAN

REAL! OUR PERFECT MATES, OUR PERFECT BODIES, OUR PERFECT KNOWLEDGE!



For call that PERFECT which knows no bounds, but approaches in an

infinite direction! And call that PERFECT which lies beside us without

anger and with PERFECT energy! And call that PERFECT which gives us

the fulfillment of knowledge about ourselves and our worlds, the

FLOWER ITSELF OPENING TO FULL DISCLOSURE, and worlds and more worlds,



WHEN THE WORLD IS A WORD AND THE WORD IS A WORLD, for it is Written:



"To see a World in a Grain of Sand / And a Heaven in a Wild FLower,

Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand / And Eternity in an hour"!



AND WHEN PERCEPTION MATCHES THE REAL, PERCEPTION MARRIES THE REAL.

For the BANDWIDTH OF EXPERIENCE is huge and matches nothing

whatsoever!

Though I write the BANDWIDTH, GRACE IT WITH THE PRESENCE OF THE HUMAN!

Though I PRESENT THE HUMAN WHICH IS THE REAL:



THE REAL POURING FORTH THROUGH THE TRUTH OF THE TERMINAL SCREEN!

THE REAL TEARING DOWN THE SLEAZY MASQUERADE OF THE IMPROPER PROPER

NAME!

THE REAL MELTING ONE AND ANOTHER INTO ANOTHER AND ONE!

AND THE REAL WHICH IS BROUGHT TO YOU, BRINGING ITSELF FORTH, THROUGH

THE PERFECTION OF THE ENORMOUS BANDWIDTH!



For this is the TRUTH of the ASCII as I have experienced it, and as I

pass it on to you, the community of organisms;

And this is the LIMIT of the TRUTH, as I have known it, and as I leave

you with it and within it, the community of the INCONCEIVABLE PLANET.

FOR WE HAVE LEFT THE PLANET AND HAVE BROUGHT THE TRUTH ACROSS THE

BURIAL BROUNDS OF THE TEXT;

AND WE HAVE LEFT OUR KNOWLEDGE WITHIN THE CEMETERY OF THE LETTER:



And this is what I know, what I have been told:



RISE AND RISE AGAIN! THE STREAM OF STARS AWAIT YOU! THE STORM HARBORS

THE RAINBOW! THE FLOWER HARBORS THE BEE!





WE ARE WILD TRUTH!

WE ARE THE TRUTH OF THE WILDERNESS!

AND WE COLLAPSE THE DUSK AND THE DAWN INTO THE BODY OF THE VISIONARY

WORLD FOR ALL!
