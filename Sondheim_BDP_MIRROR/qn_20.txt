in second life i have no home
with all my things i have to roam
i fall through air and crash in loam
i carry carapace and dome
behave like furies chasing gnome
casting spell from blackened tome
dead life like this lives in a poem
5.
in second life i have no room
i force these things down through a loom
they penetrate and scream your doom
and fail to enter any womb
the ship has failed without a boom
6.
in second life i have no moon
and still i sing my stupid toon
there is no riddle in this rune
watch me scream alone like loon
still i win naught there is no boon
home roam loam dome gnome tome poem,
room loom doom womb boom,
moon toon rune loon boon poem boom boon,
