"The _Jinriki_ chapter states:" At that time the World-Honored One demon-
strated his great mystic powers to the entire assembly, extending his log,
broad tongue till it reached upward to the Brahma Heaven."

I say, what slid off it, writes Nikuko.

Nichirin continues: "All the other Buddhas from the worlds through the ten
directions seated on lion king thrones under jewel trees did the same, ex-
tending their long broad tongues."

A prepuce of flesh, Nikuko thinks, a foreskin of the world. Nichin adds, 
below: "The _Amida_ Sutra states that Buddhas covered a major world system
with their broad, long tongues, but lacks the truth that such a gesture
would substantiate. The _Hannya_ Sutra tells how the Buddha's tongue cov-
ered the major world system and radiated infinite light when he expounded
the _Hannya._ Yet this cannot be a proof [comparable to that of the _Jin-
riki_ chapter]. Since these two sutras are mere provisional teachings,
they obscured the Buddha's enlightenment in the remotest past." (Selected
Writings of Nichirin, ed. Yampolsky.)

Prepuce, foreskin. Foreskin, prepuce.

Nikuko, musing-transforming, clothes bursting from supine body in which
she is speaking in Nichirin's Buddhas' tongues. Nichirin turns, becoming-
tongue, long-thick pink-red flesh reaching across worlds, shadow-casting
upon islands beautiful in dreaming-waters, saliva silver with ten thou-
sand moons:

{
it can't be helped
the letters slip away from me
nikuko covers the buddhas with her tongues
covers the lands with her tongues
which carry world-scrolls of truth
sutras gospels
}

I SAY:
