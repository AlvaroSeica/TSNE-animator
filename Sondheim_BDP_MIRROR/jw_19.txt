EARLY IMPORTANT NET DOCUMENTS (1972)



SCENARIOS for Using the ARPANET at the INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUT-
ER COMMUNICATION (ICCC) from 1972 is the first guide to what later became
the Internet. The front page of this is illustrated in Peter Salus' Casting
the Net. The conference ran from October 24-26 in Washington, D.C. The 62-
page SCENARIOS was published by the ARPA Network Information Center of the
Stanford Research Institute, in Menlo Park, California. 

A copy of the guide is with the BBN Library, and I have been tracking some
of the material down. The ICCC was the first real introduction of the Net
to the (professional) public, and this then becomes the first how-to, with
examples indicating the thinking of the Net community vis-a-vis usage and
implementation. This is the sociology, not the technical history of the
Net, then. At the ICCC, there were a number of terminals; participants
could walk among them, and log in. Each "scenario" connected to a differ-
ent application, located somewhere across the United States.

The following, which I have now in xerox form, are the programs and the
scenarios:

There is a table of contents, which also lists MIT H645 Multics, which
apparently provided mail; mail was also available through BBN Tenex
itself. For those not familiar, BBN is Bolt Beranek and Newman, Inc.,
responsible for the first IMP, basically routers, that were the founda-
tion of the Arpanet. IMP = Interface Message Processor.

SRI-ARC (NIC) was set up at HOST #2 in the room. Control characters were
indicated by an up-arrow sign, which later must have transformed into the
current ^. For example, Control-a allowed backspace with delete; Control-
c returned control to the TENEX EXECUTIVE SYSTEM (which roughly parallels
Control-c for ending execution in Unix, linux, or DOS); and Control-t
"checked to see if the system is still there," similar to the "are you
there" command in some telnet programs.

Other commands included, of course, DEL, CR (carriage return), etc. Com-
mands were preceded by @. 

The SAIL AP Hotline was at HOST #11, "a direct Associated Press news line
carrying national and international news. The AP Hotline has been
interfaced to the SAIL system at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory. Any terminal on the ARPA Network can be turned into an AP news
line by running program 'HOT' at Sail."

The following setup had to be performed first:
echo remote;
insert linefeed after every carriage return
login to SAIL
LOGGER says you're being connected
T R OPEN says you're connected, both transmit and receive.

Then a second login opens the particular program; the word is "hot" with
some other commands:
r hot <CR>
(in other words, type r, space, hot, carriage return).
You then get the linefeed from AP until you type...
Control-c.

Finally, let's look at the UCLA-NMC HELP at HOST #1. The description is
probably that of the first on-line example of hypertext (and very very
early hypertext as well):

"HELP is a subsystem at UCLA-NMC which permits a user to interrogate a
database which is organized in directed graph form. Each vertex of the
graph has a paragraph of information, including some information about
further details which can be obtained from vertices which are reachable
from the current one.

"Thus, the user moves from vertex to vertex, investigating each item as his
interest directs."

The login sequence is six steps. You then login:
LOGIN iccc <CR>
and get a return:
JOB STARTED
Then you type
help <CR>
and get
NNN HELP STARTED
where NNN ps the PID, or process number assigned to HELP.
You next read
DO YOU KNOW HOW TO USE THIS PROGRAM?
no <CR>
and you get a tutorial.
Or you can answer yes, and then read:
ENTER A SERVICE NAME, X, or ?
to get a list of things you can get help about...

Here are the help functions:
HELP - short description
LOGIN - ditto
MSG - "how to use our message processor"
NETWORK - "tutorials on network resources"
SRVYGRAPH
TELNET        -       note this early appearance of TELNET for the public!
SURVEY - "some random comments"
