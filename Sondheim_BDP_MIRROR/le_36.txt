Smart Poem Remains Forever


Here I'm writing a poem.
This line's under the first.
The lines stick on the page.
Nothing seems out of the ordinary.
It's the beginning of graphics.
There's space to the right of the lines.
There's space above and below.
You've got to give space to the poem.
It feels like meat on the bones.
But it doesn't move; it lies here.
It's already a corpse to cry about.
WAAA! WAAA! The corpse of the poem.
It's good to write death about death.
Our lives are from earth to earth.

Here I'm continuing the poem.
This stanza's under the first.
The stanzas stick out on the page.
Nothing seems out of the ordinary.
Look at the shape of the stanzas. 
There's a bit of a shape, not too much.
Byron's Don Juan has shape.
The Ancient Mariner has shape.
Sometimes the poem spreads out.
It thinks the page is a body.
It lies there dead on the page.
Chuff chuff says the poet's breath.
Rereading the line, I keep breathing.

I want a poem that leaps off the 
page and continues when the voice stops.
I think the poem will be a good 
imitator, life won't go on as before.
It will sound and shudder, speak back, 
jump, clawing your neck. It travels 
thousands of miles in broken packets
machinery has to put together in 
order for it to return to the condition
of the poem, and even then something 
else might happen, a letter leaving, 
image heaving.

Where are the broken poems that keep
breaking?

There's a dampness to lines of poetry.
They seethe into the page.
Think of Bishop Gavin's translation.
Something's crying to continue!
Who could be under the stones?
What's the map in the foam of the surf?
It just sits there. Poems are great markers
Of the human condition and the times we are
living in.
Inside the book, they face each other
all the times.
