the enormity of these figures... hard to convey in virtual worlds...
you don't have to take my word for it... check it out, you'll see...
you can sense them looking down at you... guardians... working for
your benefit... whether you like it or not... it doesn't matter...
one at a time and it has to be night... broken into pieces always
reassembling... you can swallow them whole... their mouths big as
the universe... at least this universe... i'll tell you more, i'm 
breathing...

stalled

B train stalled at 4th street station. it approached slowly, 
less than walking speed, then stopped in the tunnel. i couldn't
help it, i thought immediately of terrorism, take-overs, fury,
hostages. we never found out what went on. but the voice was
there, filling the station, and it wasn't comforting. later i
took another B coming in front of it, on another line, sparking
all the while. i got off at Dekalb and waited for an R. two Qs
came and went and i waited. the R never came. i took another B
to Atlantic. what happened.

1980s Egyptian oud

http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/ASC.mp3
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/ASCflesh.mp3

- just received this, shallow bowl, nice rounded sound, lots 
of cracks. think this was originally inexpensive (poorly made
sound hole filigree for example), but the spruce top has aged
beautifully, so the sound is good and the action isn't
terrible. when i listened to the recording, i could hear my 
nails, my breathing (upper and lower chest, wheezing, tense
from allergic reactions), moving the instrument around, etc.
- and thought - this is the sound of the flesh - using hiss
reduction - keeping only the hiss - i _sought_ to bring this
out - this labor - fully - finding the sound fantastically
transformed, something else of the wonder of the world 
seeping through, o courage! to contain this and re-present
this as the Sign -


installzoom

Full bandwidth version of crystal radiodetuning and resonance
in the Eyebeam window gallery installation going down tomorrow -
always fascinated by the sounds; in this case, you're hearing
pretty much what the piece sounded like from the storage room
behind the window. recorded with Zoom H2.

ear smarks

http://www.alansondheim.org/earsmarks.jpg

a 'smark' is a 'smeared mark' generally made by an ear or forehead 
placed against a plate-glass gallery window; it is produced when 
(on the occasion of) a subject attempts to listen or view the 
sounds or sights within. numerous smarks create a _layered smear-_
domain_ which is an apparatus for the transmission of bacterial or 
viral agents between viewers and / or listeners. the result is an 
extremely simple means of epidemic creation, which may be summarized 
as the _lure-share technique._ in other words, come see and hear my
beautiful gift to you - an amazing delight - a delicacy - and catch
the deadly _migraine-flu!_



Pompeii (the proper name, pompeii)

(virtual world work, philosophy, memory, sign)

video / thesis / name of the face

http://www.alansondheim.org/pompeii.mp4
the face/body reconstitutes itself, dragging hermeneutics with it.
nothing remains but the rewryte of memory, continuous.
face/body neither dead nor alive, axed or picked or nubbed.
one hundred meters minimum, holding avatar by choreography,
or the gravitational pull of dance and tensor calculus.
because it generates from nothing, proceeds from annihilation,
unerased from previous aeons, themselves under erasure.
what human can never know, extent of space and time.
all bridges are broken to this image-land land-image, 
which seems to insist on the human in the midst of substance.

image / thesis

http://www.flickr.com/photos/asondheim/sets/72157628368639267/
frozen, released less than desire or interpretation might procure.
something to do with inscription, who or what inscribed.
that is to say, the signifier of something in remembrance,
of the human, or in human memory, or memory of the other.

older space-time genres, they can't fit, they can't make it

painting / thesis

http://www.alansondheim.org/justpaint.mp4
beauty of continuous development of abstraction,
carrying the weight of flesh or bouquet of human energy.

sculpture / thesis

http://www.alansondheim.org/justsculpture.mp4
immobilized development of organisms, what remains, beyond,
or only the static caging of desire, something within these,
untoward, held in abeyance, petrification or circumscription,
boundaries always already out of reach, out of touch.



industrialization and Ossi Oswalda the cat*

http://www.alansondheim.org/ossisnoring.mp3

Ossi is a West Virginia feral cat, who has lived with us for four 
or five years now. Her haunches are odd, and I have the feeling
she was the runt of the litter; she used to be defensive and
fierce, striking out if we got too close. Now she's somewhat more
relaxed. She snores, which I think is a combination of what was
probably a hard life, and the air around us in New York. For we
live next to a 20,000 seat stadium going up, and asthma's on the
increase in the area - I've started using two inhalers myself. We
fought the good fight (platitude) but you can't fight City Hall 
(platitude), and the it won. The stadium's owned largely now by
'a Russian' since the US owners were going broke; we have our
suspicions about this. In any case, the air is foul with dust
and construction noise/vibrations (which helps account for my 
mood, among other things), and Ossi's snoring has gotten louder
and more 'wheezing.' We're inhaling particulate matter day and
night; dust is everywhere and our place can't be kept clean. So
here are the new in-dust-trial sounds of Ossi the cat, who will
probably live forever.

* NOT the silent film actress, for whom Ossi is named **
** Thanks to Rachel and Frank for her of course!

old man mad about painting

http://lounge.espdisk.com/archives/762

i have no idea after the fact, what to make of this.
it's everywhere rough. it tries to bring everything in fast.
it's zen. there's no doubt. it's oud after shakuhachi.
oud chases shakuhachi down. it's ugly. it's empty.
id disappears. it is emptiness of gravitational horizons.
and it is the extension of bandwidths of virtual particles.
it gathers speed and collapses for no reason at all.
it challenges reason and causality and origin.
it is the refuse of a universe paradoxically emptied of time.
we note this from our position before we disappear.
like disappearance we take this sound with us.
this sound is already disappeared before generation tantra.
of completion tantra this sound is oblivious.
of the world there is this sound and there is this old man.
there is this old man mad about painting. i am that man.

stuff with Mark Skwarek (video) and Azure Carter (stills),
we're getting there. I want an electric/electronic in-visible
environment, peripheral, the images are residues files,
they're never concrete, there are small printed 3d plastic
objects that have been spit out, they require no thought.
I want to free myself of misery, I think the best way I can
do this is to turn into air, into pure in-visibility, into
nothing but inscription. That too will dissolve: crash goes
the data-bank, hard-drives, no matter how light and dense,
sink to the bottom of the sea. And there's always sea.

oud, double-course strings played individually: i worked this out
originally for cobza; here it creates bell-like tones resonant 
with the poetics of the origin of the world. i hallucinated korea,
playing the figures of goddesses and dragons from the great tomb.
i hallucinated figures making their way slowly across the stretch
of strings, roads of limited durations. i hallucinated them
literally, my eyes closed, head pressed against the belly of the
instrument, its vibrations my very own, the singular music of
historical memory occasioned by the figures; it was their memory,
not mine, they communicated through the murmur of the wood. for
this is a strange oud, almost drum-like in the warped surface of
the top, which speaks among us, uncontrollable. blind i played,
my hearing opened to the circuitry of particles announcing the 
end of history, but what an end, of the yi dynasty, emerging from
the future anterior of this memory, accountancy. the figures are
there, enmeshed in narrative, but obdurate, hardened beyond all 
belief, among stories and enunciation: in other words, they remain
present, surely watching me, half-ghost, out of the corner of
their eyes. incomprehensible silence, they remain in that eternity
i can only dream of; in my dreaming i play the surface and depths
of the oud, i pass the playing on, i am transfigured, i am within
the circuit where they remain, until i leave the world.

the reign

from a distance under azure skies,
azure turns, and you can hear the cries
of monstrous grommets of venom, leaf, and rose,
transforming culture into brickyard prose,
but here the blackness turns against the screen,
and one can only see what one has only seen,
the frame says all, what's inside's disappeared,
and in all likelihood, curtailed what one has feared,
that nothing states its name in noise and hurricane,
or if it does, one leaves, with nothing but the rain.

Invisible City

http://www.alansondheim.org/toaster1.mp4

the Newtek Toaster was an analog/digital fx unit that  
was widely used 15 years ago. it's possible to recreate
the fx in digital with some degree of accuracy. that's
what's going on here. I write with a 'slight fever'
brought on by who knows what. the result is Invisible
City which reverts the real back into the layering of
Second Life. the city dissolves, or rather the always
already dissolved city is reeled back into the apparent.
I insist this is the truth of the city, that everything
else is fiction. my insistence is performative.



foreign voices

http://www.alansondheim.org/install5.mp3

well, foreign voices are the swallowing of unaccustomed throats,
taking advantage of vocal apparatus designed around the halo
of a species, everything is built from phonemes and bandwidths,
onsets and denouements, and every language is a language, well,
every sound a language meandering, from the depths of the world,
a tree falls and no one is around, ah well, the tree speaks to 
others of its kind, or the tree speaks and speaks, and listens, 
there's that failure, of its falling and its failure of hearing,
another language disappearing, another skein, interrogatives and
interjections, nightly murmurs, bamboo, this isn't foreign,
or is foreign, well, palm trees, near an ocean, shells and sea,
ah well i understand you, saying, you are ever so slightly
present, there are unaccustomed organs of speech, and song, 
do you have song among you

the utmost variety appears within the monolithic signifier

fundamental multiplication of any variety with 1 results in itself;
1 might argue that work has occurred, that the variety, now, some-
what in relation to uncertainty, has been modified, that the 
modification is indiscernible. nonetheless the strength of the
monotheistic religions is evident: nothing and everything is new
under the sun. eliminate god, and godless atheism results in an 
absolute and fearful null, a zero within which the heat-death of
the universe and all we hold dear, is an occasion, which appears,
literally without notice. in the meantime, 1 might offer the
following equations, out of an infinite series, but near the very
beginning, for your contemplation:

Ending of an era

http://www.alansondheim.org/synth2.jpg

This is an image of the analog synthesizer Gregert Johnson and I
assembled in the late 1960s; we used it in a number of concerts.
Later it was used by Denise de la Cerda and me, as Damaged Life.
It was heavy, built into an old telephone equipment rack, but it
lasted until this past October, when our parents' house had an
estate sale. I assume it was destroyed at that point. When it was
new, it ran off two +/- 12 V Heathkit power supplies. The modules
were built from scratch, and included voltage-controlled amplifiers
and oscillators, as well as active integrators, sub-harmonic gen-
erators, and so forth. External signals could be sent into it at
any number of points; the cords were color-coded. There were a 
small number of independent modules built around the same time, 
and I still have these; they include two VCOs. It was possible to
over-drive the VCOs, which sent them into harmonic oscillations,
an effect difficult to duplicate. This picture was taken this past
September; I hadn't used the synthesizer in a long time. Its real
heyday was probably in the 1980s. Building it, following Greg's
designs with him, gave me insight into systems organization; the
synthesizer seemed almost alive. Digital epistemology imitates
analog ontology, or some such - at least it seems on the surface,
before one probes into the subatomic. The world smears out; the
synthesizer (which remained nameless) is gone, earth and memory
sutured over yet another wound or byproduct of human organization.
What's lost never returns; information may not disappear in the
universe, but it becomes irretrievable. I remember plugging-in; I
still plug in; it is the same. I'm not writing this here.



Quick reviews - recommended books -


Hello Avatar, Rise of the Networked Generation, B. Coleman, MIT, 2011

- Highly recommend this book which isn't the usual first-person
narrative, but carefully builds a theoretical structure for analyzing
the phenomenology of avatars, which we might be taking increasingly
for granted; the days of Sherry Turkle's Life on the Screen have been
replaced by life. I like the breadth and time-line of the book. I 
picked up the copy at Eyebeam; it's one of the more useful recent
volumes of theory/sociology/philosophy of new media to emerge.

Noise Channels, Glitch and Error in Digital Culture, Peter Krapp, 
Minnesota, 2011

- Again, highly recommended. The book is theoretically dense but quite
astute; I remember the author from a Derrida list years ago. I think of 
his approach as 'deep glitch,' glitch as basic to online culture; the 
volume goes well beyond glitch as style. I'm working my way through the
book now; I hate doing this, but the last sentence indicates the author's 
approach: "And so the digital humanities assert that 'from the standpoint 
of art forms instantiated in informatic media (aural sounds, visual 
images, linguistic signs), the noise _is_ the art.'" - the quote is from 
Bruce Clark. I'm trying, using books like this, and the above, to find a 
home for my own standpoint; these come close and are far more useful than 
other works which emphasize heavy description plus theory.

The Destructive Power of Religion, 4 volumes edited by J. Harold Ellens, 
Praeger, 2004

- This is an amazing collection of essays on 'Violence in Judaism, 
Christianity, and Islam,' with an introduction by Desmond Tutu. They're 
not anti-religious, but they are upfront about the violence inherent in 
various scriptures and practices, and potential solutions. Liberation 
theology would love these, I think. I found the books at a library sale 
for a dollar each; they're extremely expensive, but there's a one-volume 
version that's relatively cheap. (I haven't seen it.) If you can check 
these out a library, please do.

The Better Angels of Our Nature, Why Violence has Declined, Stephen 
Pinker, Viking, 2011

- Eight-hundred pages of analysis makes me believe once again in 
psychology as a useful science, and for that matter, as a science to some 
extent. The thesis of declining violence - in spite of continuous 
massacres, extinctions, scarcity economies, etc. - seems promising. I 
purchased the in a state of depression after my father's death and the 
split-up of part of my family, and it helped. There are troubling sections 
(including time-lines and absolutist/inerrant religious tendencies), but 
the book as a whole is reasonably, guardedly optimistic. Highly 
recommended.

The Poetical Works of John Gay, Including 'POLLY,' 'THE BEGGAR'S OPERA,' 
and Selections from the other Dramatic Work, Edited by G.C. Faber, Oxford, 
1926

Everyone knows The Beggar's Opera, but Polly is rarer, and then there are 
strange things like The What D'Ye Call It, and Trivia: or, The Art of 
Walking the Streets of London. Do check these out; they're fascinating and 
strange and oddly predecessors of Brecht as well. 

Pseudodoxia Epidemica, Sir Thomas Browne, various contemporary editions

If you haven't checked out Browne, you should - he wrote any number of 
works you might know including Religio Medici, but the Pseudodoxia is the 
most interesting - like Aristotle's Problems, it deals with a variety of 
unbelievably wide-ranging topics, but the speculation on them is 
absolutely wild. There's 'Of the cutome of saluting or blessing upon 
sneezing.' and 'That Iews stinke.' (he concludes that they do not). Then 
there's 'Of the cheek burning or eare tingling.' and 'Of smoak following 
the fairest.' and 'That Children would naturally speak Hebrew.' Amazing! 

Green Eyes, Marguerite Duras, translated by Carol Barko, Columbia, 1990

Reflections on film, Judaism, phenomenology, Chaplin, Godard, 'Raymond 
Queneau, Reading Manuscripts,' and so forth. I love this book which 
meanders around the sites of ambiguity; if you like Duras, you'll love 
this as well. I found it first in the French Cahiers du Cinema edition. 
The English includes other interviews and a different presentation of the 
images.

-- These are some of the books I've been reading - and love. There's 
little of the Buddhist here; I've been questioning my interest in Buddhist 
texts for a variety of reasons, and this has gotten in the way. On the 
other hand, I've been reading again into Japanese Noh, but that's another 
although similar story.

just a little bit farther

http://www.alansondheim.org/clinamen.mp4

no inside, no outside, no direction, an urgency, a distance
beyond itself, a diacritical mark, a birth or push, a death
or pull, just a little more, just an urgency of sight, just
a sight of urgency, sight for sore eyes, site for soaring
eyes, just anyway at all, neither here nor there, just a
swerve and a run, just the running of a swerve, just the
urgency of it, the disquisitional mark, the dialectical birth,
just the pull of it, just a little less, just looking about,
neither here nor there, just a distance a little bit beyond,
just a sight for sore eyes, just little deaths everywhere,
little births, bursts or pulls, a little more pull, little
more push, just nothing, remain here, i'll go ahead


my writing of infinite depth
