So we cover, however roughly, the mathematical, epistemological and onto- 
logical groundings of real life and virtual worlds: I want to argue that 
this is a basis for being in virtual worlds, a basis for theorizing them. 
In other words, we need not, necessarily, move through either the social 
or simulacra of real world physics; we can start elsewhere, as Being or 
the problematizing of beings, in a fantasm of mathesis. And that may 
expand our considerations elsewhere - from more than three-dimensional 
manifolds, to spaces without gravitation or with several gravitational 
(positive, negative, neutral) fields, and so forth. There need not be 
objects, weathers, plateaus, height from a planar origin - perhaps only 
flows or diffused light, or nothing at all. Nothing need be taken for 
granted: It's all open.
