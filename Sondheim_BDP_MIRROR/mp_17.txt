SUPERNATURAL LIFE


  After some reflection I came to the rather startling conclusion that 
thoughts are as supernatural as past history after death. I simply 
discovered to my surprise that thinking is unnatural. I then reflected a 
little more and discovered that I have no day-to-day existence. It is a 
life-to-life existence and life is supernatural.
