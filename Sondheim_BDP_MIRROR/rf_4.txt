the radios (there are three in the images; most likely the loose
coupler or 1919-1920 radio set would be used) would run into a
small guitar amplifier; tuned between stations, competing voices
and static would appear in relation to the small distorted avatar
figurines beckoning one into worlds of memory and violent death:
it's as if one might say, here are the contraries of the hungry
ghosts of this world, forever circulating among discharges and 
wires, and here are the remnants of memories in contradiction, 
one against another, alternatives among alternatives, the early
working of wittgenstein's tractatus, the scattering of logical
possibilities among the remnants of things among the dying, and
of other things too scattered, too wounded to stand


cassette

http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/cassette.mp3

oud recorded with TC-152 SD Sony recorder (first professional cassette
machine, 1973), using Realistic Stereo Electret-1 microphone 33-919A,
early (date unknown). 

3 pieces. there's a glitch in the cables resulting in a mix of static
and odd digital limiter behavior that adds to the recording. there's 
no audible wow or flutter in the capstans. you can hear capacitance 
changes as a result of static buildup perhaps related to an imperfect 
connection; the tape plays back perfectly on the recording machine.

there's an urgency in the voice of the oud making itself heard within,
not above, the fray. i think the problem is in the analog/digital 
interface. the TC-152SD was manufactured with specially hardened tape-
heads that haven't been duplicated.

the recording was made with limiter, normal tape, Dolby B. the analog
sound of the original is superb since transients are handled better,
at least in this case, than with the digital Zoom H2 recorder i
generally use.

the wounded sound is sublime, reaching above itself, bringing you a
new music; in fact i was reading John Fahey while listening to this
amazing version.

gltsch

http://www.alansondheim.org/gltsch.mp4

just when you think you're hollow enough to swallow the world,
and there's nothing left for you to do but cuddle under the walls,
light bursts forth, dissolving everything in a blue-screen wreck,
and everything you ever loved dearly topples and bursts away,
leaving the brilliance of shattered light over and over again, 
and your fear oozes out, and you're disappearing a little more,
breaking everything down as you collapse in tears of misery and pain,
and you breathe and there's no air, bleed and there's no blood,
drown and there's no lake, burn, and there's no fire,
and you shout, there's pictures, pictures, pictures,
and you scream, there's magazines and book and plenty to hear,
and you cry, there's places to go and the moon is always full,
and the moon is always bright, and the moon is always there,
and you're listening to the murmur of seas lapping on sullen shores,
and those walls keep on crackling and the light keeps coming through,
and just when you think you're still alive, you've already passed
through the light, and just when you think you're still alive,
you've hardly passed at all


uncanny beauty with avatar choreography of minuscule particulates

trills, spills, and chills

what they do when they are dancing

odd cries and whimpers over mara the creatrix from mara the avatar

the sad sound of molecular machines saying goodbye to their own
creations
http://www.alansondheim.org/mara.mp3
how they sound when they are being made



snaps of such

a distance one might travel to do meet some of these,
others have made them to be broken by the laws of nature,
the laws of nature brook nothing!
hello, i said, you dwarves, you women, you avatars,
you man just lying there with nothing to do,
or did you crawl up and leave your footprint on my behind?
o woman o man o fantasy creepers! it's pain to write this,
more painful to fall out from the bottom of the earth

assorted broken found figures and two new figures
all in pain or production of pleasure
something will happen just for a moment and a limb is lost,
an enormous map of a body covers north america,
and there you will find lives and phantoms breathing,
they're last and asia's first, in the midst of a desert,
where europe and antarctica glued by africa, decide,
one and for all, we're going to south america!
(australia can only watch and catch a nasty cold!)

caressing of maudatar avatar becoming-dancer,
maudatar, which swallowed so many motions,
dance-steps designed by programs and machines
that s/he lost form and figure for tiepolo and in heaven
there in the blue sky s/he makes hir way across ceilings,
only to descend like tadpoles and swift darters,
knotted world-swallowers they were and will become,
there's nothing like them or like unto them anywhere,
anywhere but the process of becoming ... maudatar

maudatar is an abstracted avatar-form produced originally in Blender 
and motivated by modified bvh files in a number of videos. there are
some internal chambers which may or may not connect. the form is
dedicated to the dancer Maud Liardon, who we worked with several years
ago. the ideal size of the piece would be somewhere around a meter 
high, perhaps slightly less, something dominant, yet something one 
might trip over. the holes might take an arm or leg or might not. the
form sloughs from organic to industrial, as if iron or liquid metal 
were home-grown. 

everything in the world is graceful, full of grace. there are no
weeds, no vermin; there are only life-forms and our blindness in 
relation to the destructiveness of our own value systems. we are the
fundamental of invasive species, but we can make harmonies of 
untoward fragile and sullen beauty, something one might inhabit,
something fulfilling dreams of creatures great and small.

The State Department brought 10 Asian journalists to Eyebeam today, 
and some of us showed what we have been working on. The images below
