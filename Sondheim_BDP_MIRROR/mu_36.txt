There cannot be the slightest doubt that false charges of sodomy are more 
numerous than those of rape, and that this is too often a successful mode 
of extortion. This is rather a legal than a medical question; but it is 
especially deserving of notice, that these accusations are very frequently 
made by soldiers and a bad class of policemen!
