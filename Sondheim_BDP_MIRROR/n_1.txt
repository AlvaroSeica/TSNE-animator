Buddha Negation


These are simply notes-towards, thinking it through. Negation in cyber-
space is always a judging, performative. Quit quit exit e Q .q kill delete
@quit. 

These function as _protolanguage_ (see Bickerton, Language and Human
Behavior), which is also the language of the moo/mud. The syntax is unary,
conjunctive. Context is imminent. 

The _creative autonomy of language_ : is absent here. Only in the bypass-
ing. We are thrust out through the libidinal restraint: get all from 
corpse, kill troll, hug Kim. 

The text is always a byproduct waiting for the command say ". Waiting for 
the command : emote. As in late capitalism, one _adds features._ The 
language doesn't "improve"; it isn't. 

The texts smear themselves across each other's bodies. The commands 
create incisions among them. Negation is absolute, because it eliminates, 
not like shit or piss are eliminations which render the body abject, but 
like purified heavy water which annihilates the body absolutely in the 
process of its cleansing.

What is judged and eliminated in cyberspace has never had existence. Has
always been cauterized, cut off. But it is language at the mercy of proto-
language, and that is the nature of the Net, and its politics:

Language at the mercy of protolanguage, the performative cutting of worlds
of meaning.
