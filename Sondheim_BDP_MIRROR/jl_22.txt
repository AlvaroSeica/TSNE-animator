Here I AM, A True Story Continued

Here I Am alone in this apartment by the shore, there are cold waves and
wind out there and I Am Alone with two laptops and one personal digital
assistant, the other three computers have blown it down by the shore As I
Have Said, and the other folk in this house are Out and I Am Alone to wait
for the arrival of Thievery as I have said and the Neighbors are Suspic-
iously Quiet I do say. I will fight to the Death to have These Laptops
Preserved in their present condition, that is In My Vicinity and me in
Good Health to boot, so that Neighbor Be Forewarned, I have my Pickax at
hand and the Fiery Urge to Use It!!!
