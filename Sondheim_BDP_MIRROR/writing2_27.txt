I hope this has clarified both my work and a number of ways one can write 
online - ways that take advantage of various programs and tools in some- 
what simple fashion. The material might look complicated, but it's nothing 
that couldn't be learned in a couple of weeks, as I've said above. And it 
offers the writer (and reader) an unparalleled chance to explore language 
in new ways, ways that depend on interactivity, as well as what comes out 
of one's head.
