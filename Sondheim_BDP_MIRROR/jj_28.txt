Omen of Signifiers


The last night I was in Sydney, I communed with an Australian possum, sim-
ilar to Trichosurus fuliginosus, from a distance of 1.5m; we talked for a
while, explaining things back and forth. She continually remarked I seemed
alert; this "alert" constituted the first omen.

>>lightning strike propitious luck

Later that same night, now into morning, I motivated a fruitbat from a
distance of .66m, its wings brushing my hair as it flew off startled. We
hardly talked. This "hardly" constituted the second omen. 

>>strike out amerikkka night unluckly flair

At the airport, I used a $2 coin for some well-needed candy; my "hardly
alert" status was waxing towards denouement. Regretting the spending of
Australia's tiniest dollar cash, I boarded the plane; at the first baggage
claim (customs, SF), a $2 coin rolled down the chute, landing, rather
befuddled, level with my knees on the rotary belt. Hardly rotary, my knees
firmly planted on American soil, I was certain this was the third.

>>bondi beach much loved broad nipple flair illumination

As in Jerusalem, where comets, foxes, storms, each constituted cyclical
omenic presagings or hermeneutic circles, these three omens announced one
another, forwards and backwards in time; I was their term (stage, arena,
theater, playing-field, body, imaginary, symbolic, erasure) of pure tran-
sitivity. Caught between future and past, I began to disappear. 

>>lost time, your packets are waiting there;
>>timed out routing error machine washed down lathered
>>nipple net suckling dark spirit mouthed 

Every telling a foretelling, already told.
