Video Dromadology


Making a video, one minute long, returning to this technology I have 
deserted in favor of blind-sight, suddenly vision returns, the edge of 
the screen (not terminal) becomes terminal. Vision cuts through the body, 
and I need to pursue the corral, limpid, the mind which floats against 
the scan-lines of the set. I'll get naked, you put the thin dress on.

It becomes a matter of Revelations, dear Jesus, a matter of disclosure, 
dim outline of hair through the folds. The folds of cybermind bely the 
video minute, as if something is taking us away, the Chalice of Antioch 
perhaps, the last cup to touch Thine sweet Lips among the belly's hollows.

There is an Eye at the other end of the Tube which is the body's belong- 
ing and I imagine Thee there, lying so never Apart from our Fingers 
groped within each others Mouths and Organs. Vision always already 
refuses the reading of the body; cybermind always already begins with the 
body read, produced, tumescent and pronounced. 

It's time to move on from the body, coagulate the cells, remnants of 
desires thrust into a longing of the length of a minute. I insert myself 
in the midst of other tapes. I'm part of the show, show, show.
