Parmenides

It arrives unannounced at the beginning of the twentieth century:
It arrives unprecedented at the ending of the nineteenth century:

the symbol of the car crash hurries to establish itself in its intensity
nothing before 1922 squealed with the sound of shattered brakes
bodies fell against gashes of 1895 steam: Concordia: Silence!
every wire didn't glue to any other: in 1914 steam tiny copper ends
searched for tongues attached to mouths! a program waited for its radio!
Stagefright!

Just so ectoplasms, dioramas, melodramas, daguerrotypes, table-knockings,
produced those flags of which our sight was so grateful: Visual semaphore! 
Things occurred between signals, voices were conjured and recorded through
the British Census of Hallucinations. Houdini, my brother! Arthur Conan
Doyle and the faerie folk! German dwarf-sightings all the way back! She 
was tied down, clitorectomy to remove the impulses of masturbation; he 
was only whipped! Their little bodies carried us across St. Elmo's Fires! 
To this day, the smell of burning flesh around the corner, the Dodge and 
the Chevrolet: I saw three people die that way. When I was very young, 
the beautiful blond woman hugged me in the air!

_They are where none are._

Heraclitus.
