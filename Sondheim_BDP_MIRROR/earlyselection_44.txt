Song of the Stromatolite

It's early in the morning and I hum my darling sun
It's been how many years now, other than that I don't
Have much of anything to say, there's nothing new 
Under you, a fine day and the rock's giving way
To quiet heat, after three and a half billion years,
It's not worth wondering who these people are, and
After two billion or so there's a glow in the sky,
I don't have to go, bye the bye, a fish swam in
And out, must be oh, ten of them, I'll talk more
Maybe tomorrow, couple of kids down the beach, 
Other things coming I haven't got a name for just
Yet, this life of perfect surplus and surmising,
Call me naive, but I'm just about as old as you,
Maybe a younger sibling or something.
