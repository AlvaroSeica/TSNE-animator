Subject: Virtual Wraith


Surely the world is full of ghosts, thin messages moving against one's 
will or burning themselves alive in each and every log house huddled by 
the creek, near the base of the holler.

Reality is neither dream nor ghost, but a dreaming of itself, the cracks 
showing through, skin split allowing messages from the past to brand 
themselves into your dark present.

Surely this is your dark present, eyes opened momentarily to encompass 
these words, ears charred by the sound of them. Every speaking is a 
holocaust of the truth, that the sutures are thinned almost to invisi- 
bility, that there is no versimilitude, nothing but an approach which 
wavers in memory of the insubstantial.

The teeth that drip from the maw that devours from the nightmare are lost 
in the gleam of constructed suns.

You must allow yourself to this.
