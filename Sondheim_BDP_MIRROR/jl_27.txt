Celestial (LW6)


This is a boring lackluster world, said Jennifer. There is nothing in the
sky, one creamy sun, that's all, some sort of moon. I can see fuzz on a
really dark night. But where are the quasars; for that matter, I could use
a really good x-ray emission source, say, over there.

Jennifer pointed over there. She said, but then there would be too much
radiation, and it takes boredom to make a go of LW. Things take time to
simmer and percolate, bubbles from froth, froth from bubbles. Then little
things move about, in and out, up and down.

Plankton heaved according to circadian rhythms established in primordial
oceans.

Jennifer said, it's boring, but it's boring to make a world. You've got to
keep an empty neighborhood. Two suns wouldn't help, five moons might slow
things down, crash land on someone's home. The soup stirred.

Stromatolites grew double meter high, mud moved.

I'm bored too, said Jennifer. Jennifer was born, said Jennifer.
