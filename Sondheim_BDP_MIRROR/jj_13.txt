Rather than writing myself in and out of existence, I find the remains of
the day dreading a return to the hateful and fearful USA. Dusk has no in-
terest in virtuality; night refuses hir corruption at the brutal hands of
the guilty. Dawn wants home, wants nested community, the smell of bodies,
gropings in the light. Morning becomes hir. After noon, I begin to feel
comfortable in Perth, as if longing had taken root. Every hard drive to
and from friendship has a root. Evening awaits the long absence of light
and division of this body. Torn from its routes, it can't find its way
home.

Alan, in early morning.
