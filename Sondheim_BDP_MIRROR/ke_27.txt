test test test

a test of the message system, that is the telnet system underway here,
which is going from Sydney where I am now into Japan by way of New YOrk on
a more or less permanent connection through double telnet as I'd call it,
because the dfirct connection is considerably slower. Of course there are
fallbacks and retributions, evne though the speed of the keys incrases if
I don't look at the result - the result of not noticig the rrors,
ignoring, bypassin g them. of course in this fashion I can say very little
as well - I'm cuahgt up in the momnetary act of typing - there's no
_resonance_ to the thing for me, no perfection of the paragraph, nothing
of the sort, only the constant sound of the keys, the _breathing_ of the
words as they falter through tehe keyboard onto the screen, always already
left behind as a result of the lag that forces me into another/ ths
mode...
