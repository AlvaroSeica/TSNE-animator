Clone

is easy enough to do here; there are clones on talkers and I wouldn't be
surprised if @clone has already appeared on MOOs; why not wander in para-
llel on different spaces on the same MOO, using, say tiny fugue for the
ride? In real life, I have been told on good authority, one woman who lost
her baby in the Oklahoma City bombing said that she only wished her baby
had been cloned.

The drive towards reproduction will reach new vulgar limits, pushing the
right-wing over the edge into the center of a eugenics-inspired miniworld
composed of home-owners' associations and church groups. Who can doubt
this? Consider the infant/ile as spam, clogging the remnants of a world
already exhausted by resource depletion; one can imagine Argonautic babies
appeared arma-geddoned to the teeth, crawling their way to suppurating
victory over the last hovels of rotting grain.

Prefer cyber-cloning, which is all the better for you, and, unless you're
already a bot, still needs both of your singular hands in the mix.
