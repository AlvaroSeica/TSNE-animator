ashes
*even, yes, in technology, the same dark face appears, wending its way 
towards universal burial, surrounded by the rarefied vacuum of eternal 
space, discordant molecular remnants of ancient histories, radiations 
portending to this day the initial pangs of birth, uneasy dusks of black 
and emptied death.
