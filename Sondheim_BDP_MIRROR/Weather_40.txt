kill me and you get to keep my texts and software.
kill me and take my quota as well; you can build on pmc2-moo.
this is a request: put me out of my misery.
you gain two accounts, panix and netcom.com.
you gain two accounts, panix-slip and netcom.ix.com.
kill me and my inbox is yours, but you
should keep up all my correspondence to men and women,
young and old, but not to make a poem of it -
kill me and keep these software-quota ghosts.
