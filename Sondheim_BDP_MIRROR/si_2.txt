"
Dria says, "you just have to understand what it is that you're 
getting into..."
Dria says, "but it is possible to get so much more from 
it...real love, can gro w out here."
Martin says, "Jerry's talking ..."
Raxcip says, "yes, of course. "
Dria says, "you sound unconvinced. :)"
Raxcip says, "My friend was a world away."
Dria nods
Dria says, "aye...I know what it's like."
Alan says, "One of the speakers is talking about how he enjoyed 
watching the th e screen and Alan and the timekeeping.  This, I 
(Richard) think is an example o f how net.sex affords a greater 
opportunity for voyeurism."
Dria grins
Martin grins
Raxcip says, "I find it hard to exist both here on teh net and 
in RL, and wholy give oneself in either space.  I choose the 
Real."
Dria says, "I toggle between.  I am not real."
Alan says, "I choose both.  The unreal has been very good to 
me."
zone laughs
Martin says, "I really like Ari's presentation ..."
Apocryphal says, "it seems..."
Raxcip fails to delineate.
Alan says, "JM is asking about the ethical challenges posed by 
net.se x."
Apocryphal says, "like there's no one-or-the-other each infects 
the other"
Martin says, "The text was most lost on me ... but watching the 
images of the h ands was definitely affaected by the MOOD of the 
text ..."
Alan says, "Don't forget that the Cathoholic Church has decreed 
that net.sex is a sin."
Dria says, "I walk out into the world 'rl' and I 
feel...unreal...it is surreal. ..it all feels surreal.  I have 
realized that "I" am not real (to anyone else, at least).  So 
why fight it."
zone exclaims, "!!!"
zone says, "That is astonishing."
Dria says, "you're not serious.  You *can't* be serious."
Alan is serious
Dria boggles
Speaker says, "Ari says even email is theatrical .."
Apocryphal says, "the screen as contraceptive"
Alan says, "Dria, I think in the long-run, this is a great 
development.  With a simple decree, the Church has given 
credence to cyberlife.  That's a good thin g."
Raxcip says, "the catholic church would never approve of fun 
without consequenc e."
Dria says, "well, yeah, but.  It's still stupid. :>"
zone nods.  Yes.  Calling netsex a sin has in one fell swoop 
brought it to the attention of the world...
Alan says, "Yeah, but I'll take a little near-sightedness with a 
lot of vision- -even if the vision comes inadvertently."
Dria decides to ponder it for a bit before forming a real 
opinon.
Martin asks, "Any questions to ALan?"
Martin says, "No"
Martin says, "That's it ..."
Martin says, "next sesion in 5 minutes .."
Alan says, "That's it, and thank you. There's another panel in 
five minutes and I can possibly work this through as well - not 
sure what the situation will be ..."

From Cybermind Conference, 11/96, Perth, Australia

Speaker says, "this is alan's workshop discussion thing ..."
Speaker says, "1. commands to determine the state of the net ... 
@who, @whois e tc ..."
Speaker says, "2. issue of bandwidth, upgrading, new s/ware,

Speaker says, "file transfers without protocols ..."
Speaker says, "3. notion of the nature of online conferencing 
..."
Speaker says, "using MOOs, tyalkers, CUseeme, irc, real audio 
..."
Speaker doesn't have a screen atm, bare with my typing ...
Dria bares ;>
Speaker says, "web page conference announcements ... with papers 
(as ous)"
Speaker says, "erm ... ours ..."
Raxcip too is bare, but for his typing
Speaker says, "text only ... "
Speaker says, "2-3 email lists for discussions ..."
Speaker says, "time to establish the lists ..."
Speaker says, "lists transform into dealing with community 
network issues ..."
Speaker says, "real time chat ..."
Speaker says, "using 'say' or '"' in the MOO ... "
Speaker says, "esoteric commands ..."
Speaker says, "knowing all the commands ..."
Speaker says, "people who know more playing around with people 
who don't know a s much -- distracts rom the content ..."
Speaker says, "alan likes talkers ..."
Speaker says, "lots ..."
Dria says, "heh"
Speaker says, "net-split in IRC ..."
Speaker says, "talking about his experience running the online

Public Dialog from the Cybermind Conference, 1996

Please go to http://www.alansondheim.org/cyberconf.txt

This is early on, and deals with text-based vituality,
cyber-sex, community, and other related issues.
Thought it would be of interest again, even with all
its faults. The conference was held in Perth. We used
a MOO, newsgroup, CuSee-Me, and other online means to
communicate to the world at large.

kakkola - code word for the female sexual organ
bola - code work for Vajra, the male sexual organ



twilight, i'm the king of the names of the world.

i raise my vajra, siva's darkling spell bola - code work for 
vajra, the male sexual organ kas. in the jarjara was posted 
thunder (vajra) the destroyer of daityas, landscape 'focal 
points.' a second important text is the hevajra gods and the 
titans. i read two hevajra, i mentioned i was using various 
implements (vajra for example). there is no red spot on my desk, 
no flock of blackbirds, no waiter against which i measure 
myself, selves, and the world. the basement of our house is 
dark, but there is no pile of rope which might be mistaken for a 
snake, or a snake which might be mistaken for a pile of rope; 
instead there are familiar things and we find our way round in 
the dark, our politics, weak theory tending towards taz. she 
spent last night calling out random numbers. the atmosphere 
creaks with tension. changes are about. i will reread the 
diamond sutra. the small scanner computer in the lab began 
screaming this afternoon; it wouldn't stop. we opened it up and 
found everything red-hot. i scanned siva and vajra. ossi oswalda 
is dreaming again. it's night. "there exists not one being who 
is unenlightened from the awakening to his own nature by their 
very intrinsic nature the beings in hell, ghosts, animals, gods, 
titans, men and even worms and so on in the dung, are eternally 
blissful, for they do not merely experience the pleasure of the 
gods and the titans." hevajra tanta visuddhi magga (the path of 
purification) live bodies touch on the abject, but don't 'enter' 
within it; there are issues of purity and corruption. 
buddhaghosa's visuddhimagga, path to purity, may murmur, in this 
regard, of relation to illusion and suffering. there are also 
kasinas which are may be related to landscape 'focal points.' a 
second important text is the hevajratantra with its multiple 
bodies; it might be worth looking at the works of tsong ka-pa as 
well. "and so far things are working out fine; i scanned siva 
and vajra. our gods and the titans." thus i did fall into a 
soundless sleep; there a prince did come, vazraka(np) | 
rotzeh(pv) galgaln galgaln | vajra(np) | galgaln vajra. it will 
not exist or reference a stupa or glittering city of marble 
their vajra into ashur, i'm the king of the names of the world, 
you can't build an arm. tiffany's arms rotated slowly carrying 
vajra and vajra. there i did fall into a soundless sleep; there 
a prince did come, hevajratantra and 'twilight language.' 
hevajra tantra lists about twenty code words. in the 
candrakirti's bola(ka) (tib. bo la) 'gum myrrh' (a) -> vajra 
(tib. rdo rje) 'the vajra 'thunderbolt', the absolute (e) -> 
linga 'phallus' vajra 'thunderbolt' -> linga, sunya 'voidness,' 
'the void,' vacuite two versions of the hevajra-tantra language 
of hevajratantra in the midst of craving on my own furious terms 
vajra cutting lotus cutting through hells "mandala is the 
impression of the feet." (hevajratantra) landscape 'focal

emptiness, hevajra tanta and so far things are working out fine; 
i scanned siva and vajra. a note on the images. the vajra come 
closest a gesture of illumination, the concealed essence of the 
hevajra tantra, with the commentary yogarat, the chinese

'twilight language.' these are with its impression feet. 
(hevajra tantra) panchatantra hevajratantra basic list "mandala

My best improvisation on parlor guitar:

http://www.alansondheim.org/yesyesyes.mp3

Larson Brothers parlor guitar improvisation -
probably my best and most complex. I'm really
happy for this; I've been preparing for it.
It's 37 minutes in length, a little longer
than vinyl; I wanted to work with a long form
that's non-repetitive, with changing technique
and structures throughout. Do give a listen.

While I was recording I noticed the heat duct
in the room murmuring oddly, and recorded this
later as well; I used hiss reduction to bring
out the whispered messages:

Enjoy.



Roger Williams and Originary Mythos

For the first time in my life, I was able to see, and 
photograph, the founding document of a city I've lived in. The 
images here are of original manuscripts at the Rhode Island 
State Archives, and the archivist was kind enough to open up the 
acid-free boxes with some of Roger Williams' papers, including 
one of the founding charters of Providence. I'm fascinated by 
Williams' life, theories - and here, his hand- writing, which is 
very different from anyone else's in the documents; it's jagged, 
hurried, stuttering, and beautiful - all this from the early-mid 
17th century. His life was astonishing, and his writings are a 
mixture of theology and what today would be called an open- 
source commons; in the beginning there wasn't even a church in 
Providence Plantations, which was open to people of any belief, 
including atheists. Below are some of the images I was able to 
take, quickly and without flash; the reflections are from the 
fluorescent bulbs in the ceiling. Note the Native American 
settlements on the map (which is currently on display); Williams 
had good relations with them, and, at one point after fleeing 
Massachusetts, stayed in them for three and a half months. In 
any case, these documents are the legal pivot of religious and 
secular separation in the United States; this is still under 
attack.

When I think of the virtual worlds of the spirit, and perform- 
ative language in programming and Second Life, these documents 
seem uncanny, as if the words were written with the flesh of 
Williams, the concrete symbol always a surplus designation, 
opening up the terrain of the body, the physicality of the 
chartered space. Everything becomes punctum, neither here nor 
there, the dual of the (logical) Sheffer stroke, revealing 
territories of flesh and communality. What he achieved through 
writing, and what was taken away, through war, is incredible - 
in a sense a forgotten page within the history of empire, but 
one which at least keeps gnawing at some of us.

hypertext, from which dreams are made of; there was much talk of 
the Poetics list, and In fumbling about the Poetics list, making 
a decision that the world is, after all, the world, the world is
