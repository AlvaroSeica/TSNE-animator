The Twentieth Century


She was an opportunist. He was a wrecker. She was a fellow-traveler. He
was a revisionist. She was an engineer. He was a nay-sayer. She was a
saboteur. He was a traitor. She was a subversive. The opportunist slapped
the wrecker. The wrecker gave the opportunist a warm and loving hug. The
fellow-traveler embraced the revisionist. The revisionist spanked the
fellow-traveler in a materializing cloud. The nay-sayer denounced the
subversive as an informer. The saboteur sent the traitor to a show-trial.
The saboteur called the opportunist a double-agent. The wrecker expelled
the engineer. The subversive betrayed the nay-sayer. The wrecker denounced
the opportunist as unpatriotic. The fellow-traveler whipped the revision-
ist against her loving thighs. The saboteur said the traitor was morally
reprehensible. The engineer exterminated the saboteur. [1] [2]
