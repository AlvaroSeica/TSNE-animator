Thursday (written by Jennifer, 11th grade!*)


Dust lay by the side of the road. Dust gathered in the air, held in abey-
ance by the thickness of electromagnetic radiations. There were bipolar
vortices, hysterias of agglutinated particles. The heat bore down, dried
out the last remnants of liquid coursing through the sheen of long-depar-
ted ghosts. Throats were parched for lack of oxygen. Everyone in the gay
party had mummified into exact replicas of living statues, then toppled
by the unforgiving wind! It was a horrifying spectacle, were that any 
would have been around to perceive it, but the dry air promised that not
a single living soul would ever have been in sight. There would have 
been beautiful refractions of light and dark in the midst of the gather-
ing swirls. The surface of the dreary planet was corrupted, too, and all
vestiges of life were removed forever. No one would ever know what beau- 
tiful people had lived and played here, the tiny laughter of chattering
children watched by beloved parents. Lovely sliding-boards and swings 
would have been very rusted, then just disappeared.

Hyenas and beasts howled in the wilderness, themselves deafened by all
the battles that had gone on before. Everything just went on like that,
but it was all in vein!** Accumulations of refugees had been stopped in
their very tracks.** Even their bones were pulverized. It was as if 
there were an angry god alone in her world forever, because there was 
no one left to worship Her. And no one would know it was Thursday.

*I must have been thinking about cyberspace!
**Drugs?
