"No, I think people have to suffer in order to understand. I believe that
if people really suffered, as I myself have, if they really suffered and
have gone through all sorts of different agonies - or maybe that's too big
a term - in any case, trials and tribulations do help. I feel that they
are more tolerant, they are more understanding of each other, and then
they listen and they can see things better and more clearly. A very won-
derful line Mr. DeMille directed in _Samson and Delilah,_ was when Samson
was blinded: 'Oh, Delilah! Now that I am blind, I can see.'" (Hedy Lamarr)

And when I am deaf, I can hear, Julu.
Yes, I do understand you, Jennifer.
And when I am cold, and I warm and in love, Nikuko.
Yes, I can understand you, Alan.
And when I am thirsted, I am happy and fulfilled, Julu.
Yes, yes, I know what you mean, Jennifer.
And when I an hungered, I am saddened and satiated, Nikuko.
Yes, yes, I know what you're saying, Alan.

And when I suffer, I will be home to you in the springtime with flowers.
And when in agony, I will come back in the drear of winter's snows.
And when I'm miserable, oh Alan and Nikuko, you'll calm and comfort me.
And when I'm down, oh Jennifer and Julu, you'll kiss my tears away.

And when I am weeping, then I am the greater, Julu.
Yes, you are certainly correct, Jennifer.
And when I am smiling, I am brushing the tears away, Nikuko.
Yes, certainly that must be the case, Alan.
And when I am laughing, it is true I am crying, Julu.
Yes, that must always be so, yes, yes, Jennifer.
And when I am yearning, then the world is complete, Nikuko.
Yes, I have known that for a long time, Alan.

You'll calm and comfort me, you'll kiss the tears away.
