The Gag 

The recent texts are not CONCRETE POETRY nor designed for VISUAL ILLUSION;
I have no PRETENTIONS in this direction. Nor are they SOUND -POETRY or
-BYTES:

They are _produced_ by virtue of the machine, of and through the machine:
They are the _stuff_ of language, teetering between intensive semantic
content, and the fall of wording into ululation, war-cry, proto-language,
or gag-in-the-throat.

As gag, they resonate through the upper reaches of the body, drag out the
murmur of the world (Lingis); languages schizzes, melts from the screen.

It's on this edge that language is reified, asserted - the triumverate of
gag, semantics (Word), and the machine. Consider them _cyborg texts,_ as
the granting of a wish or a blood-red pearl to a sleeping princess.
