[Melded First Appearances of Jennifer in Files dd / ee Internet Text]


Jennifer walked to the window, thought albatross around her neck. Her
sails unfurled like a curly girl. I'm Jennifer, she said. I'm Jennifer and
I'm still Jennifer, she said. Now I'm still Jennifer and I'm Jennifer now
and still Jennifer. She somersaulted back into the malted, licked herself
over and Jennifer, she said. And I'm Jennifer, she said, and went to bed.

Jennifer had a thought. Honey had a thought. Pip had a thought. Jennifer
sat up and stood down. She raised her frock and cut her panties a table. 
"I will make you pile on the screen," said Jennifer (and panties). There's
a lighthouse and my eyes, said Jennifer, sitting up and lying down. She
cycled tremendously! Whirr! "You are looking at my shit!" cried! Jennifer!
Jennifer-I-Jennifer-Jennifer is a silicon chip embedded in Clara's brain.
Jennifer is an installation of Alan! I Jennifer-Jennifer is Clara's brain. 
You are Delirious-Jennifer delirious Jennifer, you won't let me go. Kill
me, kill me, delirious Jennifer. Put a bullet in my head, do it fast and
do it quick. Get rid of me, delirious Jennifer. Are Jennifer you delirious
Jennifer? If I can't, I won't and can't and won't. Can't think another
thought worthwhile, delirious Jennifer, if I can't I can't! Motherfather,
delirious Jennifer, then kill me! I be the woman, I piss milk, wet Jenni-
fer! You be the killer, kill my children! Thud, wet! Delirious Jennifer,
thud thud! Kill me, I can't think delirious! Jennifer! Thud! Thud! Thud!

ThE nEw MaChInE gets cold. Jennifer moves towards the center where every-
thing evens out and there are new microbes. Thud! Thud!
