(from Disorders of the Real, 1988)

The world is a language. 
Its logic alone does not escape me.
Like a trapped animal, it is the world which utters the first "no."
It is a world of the molecule, surviving in numerous forms.
The molecule remains on the far side of visibility.
Under certain circumstances, it produces images.
These are the nouns of the language of the world, undergoing 
transformations. 

Such is the text I have read before me.
Which in the case of the reader has produced a stain or shimmer.
So that the "I" remains no longer in the sentence, but like a gloss
or varnish appears across the surface of the everyday.
The everyday is gathered together in phrases, sentences, paragraphs...
There is a clot of blood, a coagulation as the strands seem to form
an object.
And it is in this object that the molecule extends itself into 
formulation.
