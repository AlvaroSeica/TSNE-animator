fuck-slang





always a difficulty using words that articulate the body's interior, but i 

return to this again and again, it's my inescapable pain



why "cunt" and "cock" rather almost always than "vagina" and "penis" 

because these are cited/sited anywhere



writing the antithesis to cyborg, _this_ site is the incorporation of the 

organic into a machinic always already positioned and foreclosing - 

simultaneously empty and full



i imagine this machinic existing at all times and everywhere



there is no vocabulary for this, constructing the difficulty of _writing_ 

here, cited, in the first place, the primordial place



just as there are no solutions for those institutions of real-life we 

bring to this site: the post-office, the conference, the bedroom, the 

marriage and divorce, the birth and death, the classroom, the factory



we are immersed in lag, in rewrite, in hysterical embodiment, in a 

grammatology abstracted from mater matrix, inserted into mater machinic 

sight



the new words that come will invade the bedroom, the classroom, the 

factory and we shall not insert new words to prop up older rooms, we 

shall not insert rooms at all



fuck-slang is the vocabulary of the streets, the informal or colloquial 

body, the body pushed to the limits, the nomadic body taken-taking any- 

where, parasitic fuck-slang burrows into the flesh, inhabits it for all 

time, make no mistake



we're cited, sighted in fuck-slang, site in fuck-slang, we drop the old 

institutions, move out of the rooms with their cyclical walls



disengage engage, disengage-engage:
