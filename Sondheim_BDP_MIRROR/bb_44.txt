Defining Truth


I'm typing again blood-red letters against black, the slight purples I had
been using beginning to pulsate on the screen, slow sinusoidal waveforms
as if a sea-change had flooded the terminal, loading wet transparency 
shimmering across skin and sky together.

Blood-red, anarchy and communism, march across the screen, closing the lid
on the history of the twentieth century: I salvage the colors for this
text and none other, returning shortly to the blankness of black against
white, imitation pages lost forever. 

Likewise, ASCII which may well disappear, possesses its regimented charac-
ter, letters slotted into an X-Y grid of pre-existing compartments. This
metaphoric and bleary reconstitution of _mass-man_ gives way to spatially
self-determining symbols - as if there were an essential freedom and hand-
craftedness at the heart of computer-mediated-communication. 

Eventually, communication becomes a drowning-pool of technologies, black 
waters at the bottom, white symbols at the top - almost too-white, the 
color of surgical sterilization. White devolves once again into the rain- 
bow and we're given colors we had abandoned. We swear we never know they 
existed. We gesture approvingly towards certain combinations. They're 
charted. <Red and black> is not among them. The clock ticks as the text 
proceeds. 

It's disovered that the truest replies are the quickest answered. Truth 
is given a definition.
