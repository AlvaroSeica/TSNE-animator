"Yet why must it be that men always seek out the depths, the abyss? Why
must thought, like a plumb line, concern itself exclusively with verti-
cal descent? Why was it not feasible for thought to change direction and
climb up, ever up, towards the surface? Why should the area of the skin,
which guarantees a human being's existence in space, be most despised and
left to the tender mercies of the senses? I could not understand the laws
governing the motion of thought - the way it was liable to get stuck in
unseen chasms whenever it set out to go deep; or, whenever it aimed at the
heights, to soar away into boundless and equally invisible heavens, leav-
ing the corporeal form undeservedly neglected."   Mishima, Sun and Steel
