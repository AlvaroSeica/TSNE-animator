Seams


Seems there were these two kids in a bathtub, and one said to the other,
"pass the soap, please," and the other said, "no soap, radio." 

This goes back decades, turning jokes into meta-jokes, transforming humor
into performance - those _in the know_ (nonsensically) and those neophytic
and confused...

Seams joined to the vayikra in Leviticus 1:1, the appearance of the aleph
as small text, turning Torah into grapheme, transforming iterability into
ikonic signifier - reading, vortices, pivots...

Neophytic, confused...
