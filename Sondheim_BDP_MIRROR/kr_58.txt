Her Take on Things


'"I can't really speak for Jennifer," said Alan. "You'd have to ask her
how she feels." Alan continued, "I mean I can write how she feels about
things, but that would be me writing, do you know? Not her. And I'm uncom-
fortable speaking for her. There are the usual issues of hegemonic dis-
course; there has to be some way to countermand them." Later that after-
noon, he ran into Jennifer, and she concurred. "I can handle myself," she
said. "I'm smart as hell, articulate too. And believe me, I'm sensitive to
my emotions." Then Jennifer asked if, when she spoke for herself, talking
about how she felt about this and that, whether the speaking was anything
more than words, more than a tape-recorder turned on and off in response to
questions. "Or an intelligent bot," she said. Alan wasn't sure; he was
trying as hard as can be to write everything down. "I wonder if I feel
anything anymore, myself. I'm almost catatonic, a writing-machine. I've
become a function." "You mean my function," said Jennifer. "An existence-
function in any case," Alan replied,' said Nikuko.
