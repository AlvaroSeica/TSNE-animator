the MIAMI music


to me the idea is to be buried
 inside the feedback loops blurred and resonated so they produce
 the plasma or otherwise ground/tamboura
  there are aerial sounds, the fingers against the strings producing
  racket: the background settles in, virtual particles collide invisibly
  as surface

  phenomena produce or reproduce the construct of entities; whatever speed
  there is partakes of the weight of the earth greater than ourselves,
  speed as well

  body falling from a great distance: the repetitive gives itself over: 
   it's one of the repetitive quasi-symmetrical measures of the universe

   there's no other reason to make music
   for me for me
   then to look at the phenomenology 
   for me for me

except for: the process of labor and the speed which short-circuits
 circuitry as if: going elsewhere: in music one comes up against limits
  there are no surmounting
  the limits withdraw as if they're not there

  they play havoc with us

  except for: the exhilaration of short-circuitry, fingers moving at
  inconceivable speed 
  i don't know where they are
  i don't know where they're going

    but they're constructing something as loops of thousands of notes
    making something that returns when i don't remember the origin
    when i don't think of it
    when i don't think of anything

   you can almost hear it

   it's there against the background droning and growing thicker
   so the playing has to be higher and scratchier

   taking it in with the memory
   taking in anything doesn't count

  looking around doesn't count
  playing fast doesn't either
