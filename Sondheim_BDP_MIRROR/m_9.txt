Tendenz


What does it mean to tend the net, to tend to it? What is tending some-
thing, tending-to something, in general.

Tending-towards is a falling, tending a vigil.

What does it mean to be vulnerable, open, to dream oneself into someone
else?

Vulnerability is a failing, foreclosing, the drama of displacement.

What does it mean to transform objects, spaces, trajectories, textuali-
ties?

Transformation is the remnant of magic obliterated by the counting and
accountability of step-wise procedures; spaces are their domains, tra-
jectories the ensurance of repetition, and textualities, their betrayal.

To hold a step accountable: to construct it by rules and repetitions 
from the previous step, but also to find it whole, intact, within the
previous step. To find it whole, not by parallelism, but by fragments
of logic, micro-domains.

Tending-towards is the vigil of the parallel, tending falls towards the
object which has become the subject.

But vulnerability is also an opening towards tending, reversal of fore-
closing towards foreopened, replacement by the parallel, empathy, the
drama of the other, the subject, not transformation.

Even here, even within all of this.
