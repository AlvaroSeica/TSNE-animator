Qbasic Programs



The following two programs work with VGS monitors, graphing in black

and white for the purposes of reproduction. See Internet Text for

details of the first, which is the program for three-dimensional

projections of generalized measure geometries. Note in this version

that at the "Continue?" prompt, a "1" must be initially returned, or

else the program overflows.



The second program maps a rather complex and beautiful bifurcation

set which I am at a loss to comprehend. It is a derivative from 

bifurcation equations common in chaos analysis.
