Of Video with C.


Why did I masturbate in front of C. when she dared me? 
Later, she dominated in video and audio, almost apologetically.
She told so many stories, looking directly at the camera.
Space surrounded her in a matrix that was nearly perfect.
It was that first time, exposing myself, that established the theatrical.
We made many scenes together, each full of control, desire, loss.
She wrote the word 'lonly' on my penis, misspelled and tumescent.
I played the naked Christ to her insolvent Madonna.
The greatest sin is delight in the fabric of the imaginary.
Her eyes devoured me as I spread my legs; my body was already written.
On the videos, the lonly penis was overlaid with grids, inscriptions.
The greater my arousal, the more intense our tiny worlds and stories.
She could talk me up and down; shaved, I lost my body in her reflection.
That first time, she was camera, and mirror; she was subject and object.
It was there that Jennifer was conceived, in the dampness of the day.
I felt skulls and skeletons emanating from my body.
I felt the expulsion of organs, my useless penis covered with white milk.
No one could breathe from it, no one could gain nourishment.
I played the naked Magdalene to her insolvent Christ.
The camera penetrated me, my body entwined with the language of rope.
The camera spelled its name across my insolent topography, Julu.
She would take me to the brink of the naked and pubescent lip.
Within the space between C. and me, the avatars huddled and conversed.
Later, I would hear them, writing down each and every conversation.
At that point, only Nikuko took advantage of my mouth and ass.
On that day, the camera took me into cyberspace.
That night, erect and haunted, I could only dream in white.
