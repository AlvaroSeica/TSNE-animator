Rapture


Chapter One

A big storm and a bus flips and 35 are injured. A train swooshes down the
track and kills a man. Another bus flips over. A plane slides all over the
runway. Cars slide into things. People stay in cars and planes. People are
taken from buses. The man is removed from the track and the train swooshes
on. There are three people in my life. One of them walks ahead of me; one
of them walks behind. Sometimes they take different forms. Sometimes they
walk in other directions. The one behind me carries the past and the one
ahead carries the future. When I am inside they wait at the bus-stop below
to go somewhere else; I imagine they do this on shifts. The mother of
James Ellroy was murdered when he was a child and his work is obsessively
built out of that event. Most of us have no defining moments at all and
become jealous at the possibility. Birth and death are insufficient; we
wander endlessly looking for narratives. Without plots, things fall apart
from what little glue we had in the first place. Our culture is one of
hunting and gathering, and the writing of narratives held tense and trem-
bling in books, on walls, in brains. Nothing ever prepared us for this.

Chapter Two

"If attributes have attributes, then all is lost." (from the 15.)
