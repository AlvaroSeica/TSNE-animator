book and movie

it would begin around HERE it would end around
HERE:scanned one after another after another as
well as... the WOW! sound from the WOW! room
resonating, cross-connecting one shelf after
another... so far the WOW! short film, highly
compressed, is 350 megabytes at 400 by 300 and
that's pretty heavy duty at 24 frames a second -
somewhere there's the WOW! theory in the WOW!
midst of this, information loss in order to send
this on to you, communicate - it's all hopeless,
all a matter of technology, patience, and
economics in real life -:book.mov but can i put
this up with all the WOW! compression necessary
so that the WOW! titles emerge these are the
people i collaborate with all the WOW! time!
pretty incredible and there are so many scanned
shelves and categories, shifted communities and
subjects, 'ultima thule' and cross-categoriza-
tions, and transdisciplinary or those older works
i've carried with me all my life::HERE and HERE

My Shelley Tomb


"For I have found myself sincerly concious, crost day and night, enclined 
and embarrassing and prest; the seige on my heart in this desart brings an 
ach to me, somthing hardly expected. Ah, exhiliarating life and its 
violance! Yesterday, the atmospher was dark and threatning. I sought 
assylum, invelloped by my loved one; this time there were no strange 
occurences. I wept, I weep, I witnissed dayly medecines insuferably taken. 
The docter dissappoints; I have no expectation in this hacnied time. My 
headach grows worse with each quarell; scolars will judge. I await your 
decision to befal me; from the labratory to the lodgeings, I am comming.

"How much longer with this disagreable life, improvisaing from the 
precepieces. I releive in my immagination, the seige to my concious soul 
which has staid too long in these appartments. Nothing has arrisen here or 
abroard, nothing to bring an end to these phisical sufferings. Wait; 
someone or somthing is aboutt; I will see, yes I an enclined to see.

"These negociations..."


- misspellings by Mary Shelley

my fat face thinking death &&

push my fat face into your inbox begging for attention &&
exhausted by turgid theory going nowhere $$
want to write on catherine daly mez and others poetics $$
tired of hatred & figure suicidal ##
burned out on bad news and no one wants to read this &&
another text with 'desire' and 'pleasure' sickens me $$
same with 'symbol' and 'sign' same with just about everything &&
only god talk allowed in this country &&
my fat face is suffocating with your detail ##
hold my hand and collaborate &&
i'll say this and you'll say that and my face will be killed &&
my face will be killed my face will be deleted $$
cold sores have broken out i have nightmares &&
not sleep and what will nn say but motherfucker to me and my kind &&
florian's gone away permanently and the unstable digest is dead &&
you think i'm just spam but i want to be one of the boys and girls $$
want to really matter but my fat face speaks garbage ##
beehive's off and dead i shit spam night and day &&
want to write on zen and mary shelley svengali in the injured wings ##
set up that fight of all knockout between mencius and longinus $$
bless the world cure the sick heal the wounded raise the dead $$
my fat face won't hold still it just yammers on and on and on &&
i'll give you anything i'll turn coat i'll turn traitor coward &&
i'll turn the one cheek i'll turn the other cheek $$
can't face the horror country burning down &&
fires everywhere my fat face can't breath ##
everywhere is everywhere &&
everywhere is everywhere &&

therefore 111111 = 1 and 000000 = 0

substituting

the possibilites are useless

therefore i have 'come up' with the alphabet

therefore
