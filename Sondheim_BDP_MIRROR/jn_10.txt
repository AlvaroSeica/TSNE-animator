Testing the Real


Walking down the street, I count my footsteps until passed by a moving
vehicles; the number of steps indicates how long I'll live, and I really
believe this. Every trip outdoors is another line of fate. Walking down
the hall in my parents' house, where I spent a good ten years of my life,
I keep my eyes closed; I can feel my way into any space, familiarity
opening up haunted speech. On occasion, less and less, I play tetris,
pinball, and count numbers of logon attempts.

I remain a child, testing the real; it's almost sutured, almost complete.
I have paid my dues to some unknown ISP; there is work to be done, but
_this_ virtual space is almost sealed tight. What could pass as a meta-
phor of absurdity proves itself over and over again; as participant, I
make sure the game has rules, boundaries, etiquette, walls.

I have never stepped out of the game. Cyberspace is only a subset.

It's the testing that proves the point, the footstep counting. If every-
thing were perfect, the game would be implicit. Within it, what I have
discovered of course is of no consequence. (This might have been written
by Barry Malzberg.)

And so forth. (Defuge ends it.)
