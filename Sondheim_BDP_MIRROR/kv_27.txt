Decadent Writing

One more self-reference, one more style-sheet, she said, leaving the home-
page for good.

Life is a fiction written by others, I replied, since you have written the
script that gives me the ability to reply by virtue of your words. But
that's so passive, I replied, but know you wrote for me, it's simply the
way scripts play out. The script's the thing, whoever writes it, I said,
she wrote.

I can't keep this up, I said, splitting the paragraph, creating the gulf.
There's always such between us, this impossible, inconceivable distance -
there's no way to bridge it. The sides keep shifting. I also think of
relative pain, as if the edges were bruised or wounded; each step on the
rope bridge sends the raw hemp deeper into the bank; there are blood
fountains on both sides.

You said, I said, taking sides, that there's no way to bridge it. Except
to place the central pivot or pillar where 'everything' is. There's no
central pillar to a rope bridge. Think of the banks as lips or labia;
where are you now?

I believe in biological determinism so much that I'm sure on another pla-
net there are creatures laughing themselves silly telling dirty jokes
about their thuggles.
