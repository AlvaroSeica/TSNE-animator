arbeit-world


Walter Benjamin and Theodorno in a discussion of Net-life, Second Life, 
and Crashland Tokyo. Just a snippet of intellectual work on the gritty 
industrial wasteland of the northern east coast. The view is always 
hallucinatory.

It's raining here among ordinary people. There's a sound of menace in the 
background; nations and peoples are stirring, not always with equivalent 
goals in mind. The species is out of control; roads are gouges of the 
civil, keeping the wild at bay. The primary characteristic of the human: 
an enormous inertia in the midst of plague, floods, fires, crusades, wars, 
slaughter. The human is always on stand-by. If it were otherwise, there 
would be different news to report.

It's snowing now, weather veering back and forth, downed wires. Pacific 
world, one world, inconceivable. Power seized is power held. Global warm- 
ing, peace overture, restraint, is always the face of the other. What is a 
poor primate to do.

Among the aesthetics of the grit there's the power of absence. This film 
never hurt anyone. The dead film: sightless, deaf, untouching, untouch- 
able. The occupants hurtling down the road have always already passed this 
way, passed that way. This is a new world which is identical with the old, 
the flattened world, flat philosophy, planar. He speaks, it's always this 
way. He answers with the same.

Image


What sort of object is my mandala-image? Certainly not symbolic; while 
elements represent, the mandala-image itself stands for nothing, neither 
power nor deity, fecundity, rebirth, emptiness. Nothing stands for empti- 
ness; nothing stands in for emptiness. And certainly not ikonic; nothing 
is there but the image within an aegis or indifferently existing. Then 
again, not indexical; let's say it's eaten, ingested, but there's no 
pointer, anything like that. Let's say it's of the true world, the image 
itself, and let's say it's the becoming of the subject, placed under 
erasure by the subject, placed under erasure by nothing, then of the gone 
world, then of nothing. Let's say there's neither mind nor emptiness, 
uncertainly not inherently existing image. Let's say the image is of the 
imaginary, that the true world is of the imaginary, but the imaginary has 
no inherent existence. Let's say the true world is under erasure, that 
whatever clings, clings to erasure. Let's leave it, but not leave it at 
that.



There were eyes in the walls. There were eyes in the table. There were 
eyes in the telephone. There were eyes in the keyboard, eyes in the 
computer, eyes in the mousepad. There were eyes in the ceiling, eyes in 
the floor. There were eyes in the clock that said tick-tock.
