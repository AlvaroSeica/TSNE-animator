Proton Decay


Language, the great gift of being human, moves from inscription to self-
inscription, as cyberspace forecloses on texts and identities. Whatever
one posts is always already problematic, forced into protocol and formal
dispersion. Texts no longer relate beneath difference, but participate in
the act of _concatenation,_ creating n-dimensional surfaces of syntactic
structures filled by broken codings. No coding is ur-stable or complete; 
every coding fills within a holarchy of databases, possessing momentary
identification, expansion, indirect addressing, and site. Identification
numbers are reused, lost, forgotten; expansion continues on an irregular
basis; indirect address adds layer after layer, and site replicates, ex-
hausts, always diasphoric. The _seething_ of the Net is agglutinative, 
redundant and close to the breaking point. 

External operators wound the multiplex, open incisions, insert additional
strings which tunnel towards multiple and unknown destinations. Mail
spools hold vast amounts of material, ready to lacerate the syntacteme as
soon as an opportunity arises. Every shuddering emerges, is forgotten, an
effect of erosion; let us not forget we are within a geology here, another
planet, with its storms, weathers, earthquakes, and plate tectonics.

Within these atmospherics, nodes tunnel into domains of meaning, operators
always standing by. But that is another story, and (as operators would in-
sist), the only story, what begins narrative, what narrative begins.
