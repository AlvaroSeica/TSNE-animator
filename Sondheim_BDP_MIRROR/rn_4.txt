Working Minds and Philosophy

so the Dydo was the first; afterwards, I trimmed my nails and
created the Fahey. both are dedicated to musicians I admire.
the Dydo runs furiously across scales, techniques, melodic
fragments, looking for bases; in the Fahey, bases are found
and there are moments of song, towards the end. in both Mind
is heard directly: of that I'm sure, as sure as I am of a
form of fingering and hand and arm movement that allow these
structures to come forth - what's appearing is a kind of
thinking I can only call Philosophy, in any sense of the term,
I'd say first terms or terminologies, I'd say simultaneously
untoward and abject, simultaneously structured and analytical.
it's a different form of listening, a different forum of 
phenomenological analysis. I write this out of certainty.

are the elementary particles that mediate the weak interaction; 
their symbols are W+, W-. and Z. The W bosons have a positive and 
negative electric charge of 1 elementary charge respectively and 
are each other's antiparticle. The Z boson is electrically neutral 
and its own antiparticle. All three of these particles are very 
short-lived with a half-life of about 3x10^-25 s. Their discovery 
was a major success for what is now called the Standard Model of 
particle physics."

The sound is neither an interpretation nor trope. The sound is drawn
