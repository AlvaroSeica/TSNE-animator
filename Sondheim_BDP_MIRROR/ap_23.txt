The Orders of Faith

Without knowing sufficient mathematics or detailing, it nonetheless seems
reasonable that a certain mathesis of the interior of the CPU and math
co-processor could be examined - that is, their limits - by, first of all,
repeated iterations/recursions of theoretically transcendent nested func-
tions, and second of all, applying fast fourier transforms to the result-
ing vectors, in order to extract "resonances" from the relatively chaotic
series, which may or may not be strange or other attractors in the ideal
realm, but which constitutes, in any case, attractors within the limita-
tions of calculation, say up to the limit of sixteen decimal places, which
may be rather quickly reached in practice, as terms pile upon terms. In
regard to this, I have constituted such a program, which parallels another
investigation I made years ago on a programmable calculator, searching out
limits by a simple enlargement of the tangent function graphed and magni-
as the angle approached pi/2. It is interesting to note that the IEEE sta-
ndards include two strange limits, INF for infinity, and NaN, not-a-num-
ber, evident for example with 0/0 or INF/INF. But what, in fact, is the 
point of all of this, if not to point out the limitations of the real in 
the process of constructing its own deconstruction? The _grid_ or _grit_ 
of the virtual is revealed as everything disordered becomes ordered, and 
cyberworlds exhaust themselves, shudder, move to further upgrading.
