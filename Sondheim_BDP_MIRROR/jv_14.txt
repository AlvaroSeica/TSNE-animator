Wander of Shamanism


I'm grappling with the shamanic texts, working through debris, part-com-
mands as part-objects, commands not found... And further, texts of bull-
roarers, wind moaning through cyberspace, hrmmm hrmmm hrmmm. But the magic
- sympathetic or otherwise - is elsewhere, within the performative, the
program, lines scrolling down the screen.

If shamanism goes back to the paleolithic, I _say_ that it has no origin,
that it produced language, just as the hunt did. That the repetitive bab-
bling of the semiotic _magics_ the world which knows no other, emerges
with the words to call it forth. 

Which is why I also _say_ that the inversion in cyberspace consists some-
what precisely in the fact that one begins in the symbolic, from which
emerge both real and imaginary. And how does one construct a julu self-
constructing?

All of which is mythos; there is no _ur_-language, no firstword mamadada. 
Multiply-connected, evidence of syntactical pleateaus arising out of proto-
language (Bickerton), and the latter aligned with the fetish-object; there
is no escaping the print of the hand as individuating inscription: our
hands _written and writing_ from the very beginning with the circumlocu-
tion of ochre-blood.

What could be more performative than these Lasceaux-hands in _literal_
kyberspace, steered? From Yggsadril through / root or tilde-root ~/ the
enunciation of the person?

We comprehend nothing without ecstasy; without comprehending ecstasy, we
comprehend nothing.
