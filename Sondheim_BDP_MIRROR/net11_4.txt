The Irghaz Empire





When the troops of the Irghaz empire go into battle, they are told they

will leave with nothing but the shirt on their backs. They have come

from battle that way and they are going into battle that way. They will

take no spoils and will disappear from history forever, leaving no 

memory and no trace.



When the troops of the Irghaz empire approach death, they bare their

backs, so better as to divide the body instead of the body's spoils.

Thus they have emerged from a slit or focus and thus they return.



They parade with body tilted on horses tilted; they wander mountains

strewn with boulders no smaller than a man. They are colorful with

pale flesh and beards set against purple, red, and green silks, open

to all weathers. These are not their battle-clothes, of which there 

is no mention.



The troops of the Irghaz empire leave no one behind and look forward 

to no one. They are perfect horsemen, a blur of cloud or dust on the

horizon that seems to take forever to settle. Long after they pass, it

disappears among the stunted trees growing against the slopes of the

mountains. Silent streams of water continue to cascade downward.



When the troops of the Irghaz empire pass, no one remembers their name;

no one remembers them, or their passage. This is the dream I have had,

which I have been told to impart to you. This is the impartation.



Blessed is the dawn before the darkest night. Sh'in.
