Cottonworld, America's Future


By Jersey City Sue

Fifteen children have died falling from sliding boards across a nation of
three hundred million, oh heavens, let us make them us safer with cotton
wadding all the way down. Oh heavens, let us protect the poor little chil-
dren from putting their heads through crib bars, they make them from cot-
ton too, to protect the little cotton heads! You can't be too careful in
this beloved country. Cords on sweatpants have become tangled in the midst
of little playing children as airbags just don't help absolutely everyone
riding on car roofs for free rides down country lanes, cottonworld car
roofs for cottonheads freebie riders on high. Open elevator doors beckon
freakily when cottonheads step up a step, trip trip bang their little
cottonheads against metal wallplates now turned cotton. 

Outside Jersey City Sue straps one on, bullets flying everywhere, cotton-
heads splat splattered against cotton pavement where little knees won't 
ever scrape again.
