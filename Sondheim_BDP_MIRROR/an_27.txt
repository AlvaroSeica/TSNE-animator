The Good Old Days of March 1995


Here is the NSFNET Backbone Services Acceptable Use Policy section 10/11:

Unacceptable Uses:

(10) Use for for-profit activities (consulting for pay, sales or adminis-
tration of campus stores, sale of tickets to sports events, and so on) or
use by for-profit institutions unless covered by the General Principle or
as a specifically acceptable use. 

(11) Extensive use for private or personal business.

Here is the General Principle: 

(1) NSFNET backbone services are provided to support open research and ed-
ucation in and among U.S. research and instructional institutions, plus
research arms of for-profit firms when engaged in open scholarly communic-
ation and research. Use for other purposes is not acceptable.

NSF, the National Science Foundation, ran the U.S. Internet backbone until
last year when the machines and cables were taken over by corporations. 
The result has been a thickening and clotting of the Net; by the year 2000
investment will be at 5 billion U.S. dollars per annum. If it weren't for
the darknet, many of us would be long gone; we hardly recognize the envir-
onment, which has been aggressively pursued by business as if it were open
territory - which it is. The U.S. broadcast television structure pales in 
comparison.
