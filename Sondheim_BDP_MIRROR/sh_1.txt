improvisations, with and without fx, on electric guitar
no overdubbing
i wanted to prove i could play as well as anyone else
i realize the childishness of this
but i extend myself into areas i haven't explored
i'm amazed at the sound and range of the instrument
the neck has two octaves and low action
the pickups are passive 
the guitar went through a line six pocket pod
the amplifier is made for acoustic instruments
the sound was recorded with a zoom
i worried about repeating myself
2.
almost no one listens to these pieces
i imagine my little notes running around alone
they might have parties in perfect harmony
they might compete for attention and stumble about
they might soar to new heights with friends
they might walk off and never be heard of again
i imagine them thanking me for their presence
and imagine them thanking the instrument as well
my lonely instrument is my lonely friend
i am a harlequin with a colorful guitar
3.
they sing ah ah ah ah ah
they sing la la la la la
they sing the letters of the alphabet
they sing the consonants accompanied by a vowel
they sing all the consonants
each of the consonants is accompanied by each of the vowels
each of the vowels is accompanied by each of the consonants
oh wonderful world of song and speech!
i put my ear near the storied guitar
no one else hears us and i am so sad with all of them
we are waiting for our release from the prison of our song
our song is beautiful and it is a beautiful prison
oh it is not a prison and i am so confused
it is a beautiful and wonderful place beneath the stars
and a beautiful and wonderful place within is
they sing la la la la la
they sing la la la la la
and they sing la la la la la
they sing la la la la la

the solo violaline with four oud strings, music
reminding me of so many things i've heard, not
world music, but from somewhere else - halfway
through it changes and runs from one imaginary
to another

Boost / Boast / Blossom / World's Fastest Guitar

http://www.alansondheim.org/boost.mp3

maybe not the world's fastest, but up there, a new
Ibanez RGA42 electric played without effects straight
into a Fender acoustic amp, maybe the world's fastest
but at the same time angular melodic/harmonic breaks,
something chasing the horizon; this is probably the
best guitar solo I've ever done, but you'd have to
listen to the full twelve minutes to follow the 
structural transformations. thanks, it's worth it, a.

The Bicycle Thief

http://www.alansondheim.org/bicyclethief.mp4

Some think of neurons firing as digital information, with the 
potential for firing as analog information. The potential, 
itself, can be considered as a sequence of digital events. The 
process could be likened to a bicycle pump pumping up a balloon 
until it bursts! Each compression of the pump and the subsequent 
burst can be considered a digital event! She patted her frock 
lock. O wayward! Her feet bicycled the air. Her feet occasioned 
a somatic event, a stolen bicycle and its somatic response. With 
the new guns, he fires away. Perfect trajectories are in Pusan, 
dust. Policeman Dick is riding by, a bicycle beauty,the body 
leaning into the dust. Somatic!. Two bicycle wheels hold the 
frame up. Earlier he said to her, "Someone always gets hurt in a 
stickup." "You like it," Gibbs said, the thing works like a 
bicycle, keeps going round arcs towards the curb, beneath the 
trees where girls are dangerous. He walked home. Someday he'll 
have a bicycle. It is easiest to ride in the dark. There are not 
many animals left here, a few snakes and you can avoid them by 
leaning. "The frame's held up by the wheels," said Policeman 
Dick. He patted her frock lock. O wayward! Her feet bicycled the 
air. Her feet lifted him on the frame and the rest of her fucked 
him. She said, "Someone always gets hurt in a stickup. You like 
it." She said that it worked like a charm, she kept going 
everywhere, just like a child. "What a wonderful adventure I'm 
having!" she said, "just like a little girl!" She walked home 
thinking someday she'd have a bicycle. It's easy to ride, even 
in the dark and the animals are terrific!

ICE SKY CAVE

Descending into the sky, we ascended up the sheer entrance
to ice cave Zany, when Jennifer asked in 'that voice of hers,' 
What is Zany sky? to which I replied it is certain it is not, 
but it is called Aplomb.




Psychosis

I talk and write to myself; I do this by a circuitous route 
through social media. Words and images swirl around me; there 
are a very few people who follow my work, who earn immense 
gratitude. They are my soul's mirrors, if such existed, an 
indication that language has a reflex art of communication, 
although everything might be changed in every direction within 
the semantic plane. The coordinates of the plane - its divisions 
- are irrelevant; one might use one's own labels, if one were 
reading, watching, listening. One is an active receptor. How 
many of us are there, working fundamentally for ourselves, 
waiting for the Festschrift, for recognition? How much is lost 
in misinterpretation, misreading, misrecognition?

Psychosis enters with belief, belief in the stability of at 
least a minimally receptive world. Such a world imbues itself 
with meaning, bootstraps. The meaning can only return within its 
own to a fundamentalism - of belief, theory, cohesion; belief is 
always classical, always existing within the chimera of eternal 
stability. Without belief, writing becomes a form of articulated 
debris; with it, writing turns towards inerrant masquerade. What 
lies between the two is ordinary discourse, and writing has no 
place for that, no matter the articulating structure or mask of 
anonymity.

We are all anonymous, all marked and demarcated; the psychotic 
does not know, or recognize, that. Instead, the psychotic 
proceeds as if there is the possibility of 'real' communication, 
'real' communality - as if the circuitous route 'really' led 
somewhere other than, momentarily, the self on the path towards 
death and incommunicality. All these routes and files, all these 
utterances, all beneath the sign of the enunciated on the 
material-digital plane! _That_ way lies psychosis - and there is 
no other.




Abraded

http://www.alansondheim.org/abrasion.mp4

It's the middle plate - striated, scored, abraded,
an artifact of digital processing, stopping and
starting, scraping the surface of mineral ice, or
a substance nearly broken, the smooth surrounding
waters, discomfiture, almost uncanny, sloughing
the rasp or broken raster, the central perturbing
mass, almost floating, caught uncrushed, there;
it's the middle plate, the middle plate, holding
crashed, scoriated by the urge of writing or 
pulsion of inscription, chattered against the 
narratology of flux - or rather flux against the 
chattering of the image, smashed against selfhood,

Alan Sondheim with his Wonderful Guitar, Jennifer!

For your Listening Pleasure. The first selection has a Calming
Influence on the Woes of the Day. The second picks up the Pace
a bit, presenting Wonderful Tapestries of Melodic Harmonies. 
Do Sit Back and Enjoy the Experience, no Noise or Hard Rock 
here!




	So what happened to them?
	They moved from the city. They moved to another 
downtown. They bought a place. They live there.
	What do they do there?
	They're living off capital. There aren't any jobs. They 
sit there. They do their own work.
	Friends?
	Sometimes people stop by, usually one at a time. He 
explains it as a kind of filter.
	Filter?
	A high-Q filter. Nothing really disturbs them. They stop 
by and leave. He says it was different in the city, low-Q. There 
was a lot of background. It was more active. The background now 
is passive. A lot of silence, gray skies. A lot of shadows.
	Music?
	He's thinking of stopping. They play by themselves for 
themselves. It's an odd situation. He feels he's practicing for 
nothing. He always thought of audience and people. He sits 
there with some instrument or other and plays, runs scales, 
things like that. For nothing.
	How do they survive?
	They have some money. They'll run through it. He doesn't 
really know. He's depressed. He feels he has no structure. 
There's no reason to do anything. There's nothing required.
	Good works?
	He feels his good works are his arts. He's losing his 
arts. He sees no reason to continue them. Sometimes he looks out 
of the window and thinks of jumping but he figures he's already 
jumped. That thought accompanies him. He dreams like that. Of 
being lost, returning nowhere.
	And she?
	He's the one writing this. She works brilliantly on arts 
and craftwork. She's less depressed. He would do anything for 
her. She practices music less. He has a hard time practicing. 
Neither of them really see any reason to continue. She 
encourages him. He wallows.
	He sounds awful. All of this revolves around him. He's 
waiting for the flood to come. He's self-absorbed and self- 
hating. He sits there and types this. He feels a circulation of 
spirits. He can't get into anyone's head. He's full of self- 
pity, loathing. 
	He's lucky to be alive.
	He doesn't feel that way. He's a remnant. His tinnitus 
grows worse. He hears the world through himself. She has 
infinite patience and kindness. 
	They're enduring the world?
	She doesn't feel that way; he does. He wants to do good 
acts but he's caught. The music is disappearing. He writes dead 
theory. He's trapped. It won't last forever. He can't speak for 
her. He can't write for her. He can barely write for himself. He 
thinks language is painful. He writes only for himself. The net 
is distance flesh. He takes vows of silence. He breaks them. He 
thinks of his addictions.
	They'll travel. They'll move from place to place. 
They'll leave things behind. They'll have disappeared before all 
appearance. Their words are vanquished. Their thinking is the 
world's murmur. The world is disappearing.
	At one point he thought mathematics, physics, would save 
him. That there are hard obdurate structures, that even though 
he lives in isolation, their beauty is eternal, classical. Now 
he thinks there are limits, that cosmology has reached the fuzzy 
realm of the deeply unknowable. The multiverse interrupts his 
sleep. Particle schemes transform into nightmares and cartoons.
	And she?
	She thinks differently, networking, family, art, skein, 
fabric of existence. She puts up with him. She doesn't see it 
that way. They're four stories up in a building fronting onto a 
main street. There's almost no traffic. The street is narrow. On 
the other side are federal offices, Homeland Security.
	They look into the windows of Homeland Security?
	They're preserved forever. They look out of the windows 
and move about. They look into the windows. They look into the 
windows of Homeland Security. The television and radio are on. 
The computers are on. That's what they do there. They live.
	This is it? This is what he writes about? This? Just 
this? This privilege?

"The Jew has a talent for bringing confusion into the simplest 
matters, for getting everything muddled up. Thus comes the 
moment when nobody understands anything more about the question 
at issue. To tell you something utterly insignificant, the Jew 
drowns you in a flood of words. You try to analyze what he said, 
and you realize it's all wind. The Jew makes use of words to 
stultify his neighbours. And that's why people make them 
professors."

Chimera


        So what happened to him?

	He sits there and thinks. Sometimes he writes; his 
thinking leaves a trail. (His thinking disappears.)

	What does he think about?

	Philosophy. He thinks about philosophy. He thinks it's 
an open field. (He hopes he's not a fraud.)

	Please go on.

	Cosmology, biology, physics, for examples. The fields 
are changing so quickly - there are constantly new models, new 
discoveries. It's impossible to read an useful book that's more, 
say, than five or six months old. Philosophy is different; it 
seems to be an organization of material that's underground - not 
fundamental exactly, but looping through different kinds of 
narrative structures.

	How does he feel about this?

	He feels that the aphorism, the short text, is the way 
to go, that its tethering to the world is fundamentally 
different than longer works that attempt coherency and world- 
building of one sort or another.

	And his position? What he believes in?

	His belief is a desire to believe, nothing more; with 
knowledge advancing at such high speed and the abandonment of 
religious belief (deities, afterlife, and so forth) - not to 
mention ethics itself - whatever's left is a chimera. (He 
worries his belief will get in the way.)

	And this chimera?

	He thinks of this as entangled, uncanny surfaces and 
volumes, almost like the branes of string theory. He's unsure of 
the ontology and epistemology involved (and unsure of ontology 
and epistemology in general), but feels these and their objects 
should be farmed out to the technical disciplines, the 
relativism of research programs notwithstanding. So the chimera 
might be thought of as a virtual/real what is, something behind 
the fractured vision of the cosmos, which can never be healed or 
sutured again. There's too much knowledge, too many variables, 
too high energies to be considered, distances far too great to 
produce even the semblance of experimental signatures and so 
forth. In other words, we're reaching a horizon of knowledge and 
the exhaustion of knowledge, and the chimera is the remnant of 
that. (He worries about the virtual/real but sees no path around 
it and no reason to worry any longer. So he thinks about culture 
and returns to philosophy through detour.)

	What about political economy, semiotics, social issues, 
issues of (biological) extinctions, and so forth?

	He signs petitions and speaks about these issues at 
every opportunity, but it's not his concern when he's there, 
eighty feet above the pavement, writing away. (He worries it's 
only a peripheral concern at best.)

	What is his concern then?

	His death, his quickly shortening time on earth, the 
curtain closing in. At that point - this point then - he thinks, 
things turn towards issues of ultimate knowledge - something 
he's considered for decades, something always eluding him. (He 
worries about his own naivete and his elision of 'that' point.)

	He's waiting for what then? His death?

	He's waiting in the midst of abject death, tawdry death, 
meaningless death. Except for his partner, he feels disconnected 
from the world around him; the sounds of his breaking body are 
louder than ever; they are entering stages of interference. (The 
sounds interfere with everything, his death is still not _a 
death,_ but a clumsily perceived horizon.)

	And he thinks?

	That such interference is the only true-real character 
of the world, striations across and within the chimera, clouded 
vision - a cataract world, what we are living within and among, 
a world of lost clarity, hopeless for the organisms within it.

	The chimera?

	The only hope, the last of the animals themselves.

Sarah Bernhardt


Sarah Bernhardt bangs on the doors of sound and movement and 
begs to be let in.
Sarah Bernhardt is Sarah Bernhardt presence and nothing less will 
do for Sarah Bernhardt.
Sarah Bernhardt screams and nothing is heard.
Sarah Bernhardt walks across the stage and nothing is seen.
The biochemistry of Sarah Bernhardt dies with her. Broken is the 
DNA of Sarah Bernhardt.
She says there are a few films late in life. 
She says there are some cylinders late in life.
Sarah Bernhardt knows everything is blurred and scratched.
She knows nothing of Rachel remains.
Everyone spoke of Rachel and everyone spoke of Sarah Bernhardt 
and there is talk here and there. There are mentions here and 
there.
There is writing and sometimes writing remains. There are 
remnants.
There are these Jewish women, Rachel and Sarah Bernhardt and 
Rachel screams and walks wildly across the stage and nothing is 
left of her screams and wild walks. 
Rachel screams louder and runs insanely across the stage.
Nothing remains of Rachel.
Of Sarah Bernhardt it is said, you should have seen her. 
You should have heard her.
Of those who have said that, nothing remains, and nothing 
remains of Sarah Bernhardt whose face barely graced the cinema, 
whose voice barely graced the gramophone.
Sarah Bernhardt screamed and clawed and Sarah Bernhardt is silent 
and her arms flail and have graced nothing.
The scent of Sarah Bernhardt has disappeared. Rachel has 
disappeared. The DNA of Rachel has disappeared.
You should have seen Rachel. Of Sarah Bernhardt there are famous 
photographs. Sarah Bernhardt holds still and is frozen and 
is absolutely still. Sarah Bernhardt writes and her writing 
is silent and she sculpts and her sculpture convey astonishing 
beauty.
Her sculptures are witness to the presence of her arms.
Her sculptures are witness to the presence of her hands.
Her sculptures are witness to the presence of her fingers.
Sarah Bernhardt turns as if she is about to speak. She begins a 
gesture she makes for me and her mouth opens and I begin to hear
her voice.
Sarah Bernhardt is screaming and she is silent.
She is silent like the 19th century is silent.
She is silent like history disappears and the 20th century is 
silent.
The voice of Sarah Bernhardt is amazing and it is said one cries 
and is driven mad by the voice of Sarah Bernhardt.
Rachel and Sarah Bernhardt have disappeared. 
The Jews have disappeared. I bang on the doors of sound and 
movement and beg to be let in. 
Sarah Bernhardt is silent. 
She is silent like the 21st century is silent.
Rachel has disappeared.



The Death of God

Before my Father was in the ground
The Vultures flew and gathered 'round
For His Sins the Son atones
The Vultures swarmed and plucked His bones
For His rage, Angelic Spies
Dropped their wings and ate His eyes
For His jealousy and leers
The Devils came and boxed His ears
For His tablets and His laugh
The Maidens robbed His Wheat and Chaff
They lowered Him without a sound
His mouth was sewn, His arms were bound

Now that I am in the ground
I hear His screams, His words resound
"This is the land, this is the sea,
"Mankind is my Enemy
"This is the air, and this the earth
"Mankind is my afterbirth"
We lie there, screaming, Our last Breath
Projects a World made from our Death
Stranger, if you come around,
Desecrate this Hallowed Ground

stones, all quite colorful, exotic, quaint, within the mists and
rains of anything, disappear in damp, fog.. nothing seems
possible as i lean over in the mists. don't look for me, don't
find me. i've given up truth for anything, disappear in the
mists. nothing seems possible as i lean over in the mists.
don't look for me, don't find me. i've given up truth for the
body, truth for the body

Just in time, I prove that I am God

Or, well, not God, but permanent like an inkwell
held in a reindeer's antlers. You get the idea.
You get the idea because time is the only thing
that changes. I am sure of that. The rest of the
cosmos - not at all! The full argument comes 
from the epistemology of virtual particles:
