Tonight


Islands
Flux-places, meandering shores, sands, stromatolites in the shallows
Obvious exits: [Out] to PreCambrian
Stromatolites
ancient bacterial-algal mattes, still alive in Perths' vicinity
ASondheim
writer, theory, video, lives in NYC
He is awake and looks alert.
Carrying:
 Stromatolites
You drop Stromatolites.
You say, "Do they break?"
You say, "Where in New York are there such things?"
Stromatolites say, "Wa ara jast banaath yaa, laak, darlang..."
ASondheim jumps up and down and nothing breaks.
Julie-from-Downstairs says, "Plaasa stap that, yaa ara kaapang ma ap!"
ASondheim immediately regrets his life!
ASondheim Has Fled The MOO!
