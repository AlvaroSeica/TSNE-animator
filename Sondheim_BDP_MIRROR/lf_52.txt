Phase Space


Nikuko, the beautiful Russian ballet dancer, pirouetting before the very
august presence of Doctor Leopold Konninger, her state of mind:

A violations and tears nightmare!
You danced for 262255 hours?
No no no, it was longer and shorter, 
No no no, i don't remember
and my dissolutions are those moments of re-entry, when i find myself on
mother earth father moon, when i find myself dreaming of doctor leopold
konninger, my eyes fixed on his solar visage, my dancing perfect and
continuous and 1021 and 1047 - Nikuko is still alive!

For 4 months of dissolution, we have been and buried
and it has taken us 3.000 minutes to speak our very last ...

and my dissolutions are those moments of re-entry, when i find myself on
mother earth father moon, when i find myself dreaming of doctor leopold
konninger, my eyes fixed on his solar visage, my dancing perfect and
continuous; the universe is my traditional object, the universe is my
breathing in and breathing out, space is inhabiting me; i am Nikuko the
beautiful russian ballet dancer who is winding the universe around her 
as she pirouettes for doctor leopold konninger; i alone recognize the
confused topologies of embedded space-time around my waist and breasts 
and thighs, my tutu enmeshed in nebulae and stars; oh ballet, o ballet,
hanged_man with hours of sexual fury!
