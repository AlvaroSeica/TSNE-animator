Blind, dead, and mute, I weigh six hundred pounds, have no intestines; in
my pitiful condition, I remain bed-ridden, my only source of communication
these festered words. I have not seen my feet, which are useless; my thick
hands stumble upon a finger-board relating me to you. There are tubes for
me, eating, drinking, defecating, urinating - I would that there were
tubes for thought as well, these beauty-thoughts. My condition is always
already poor; my heart murmurs loudly, irregular in its uncontrolled rhy-
thms, the pacemaker running out of current; it's a conspiracy against me.
My beauty-soul. I have not tried to speak in years; I communicate through
touch-boards, descendents of braille, harbingers of vat-brains. Inside, I
sing beauty-song. I can smell my shit; my nails splintered, uncut; my
breath vicious with decay; my teeth long since reduced to stubs; my cock
wrinkled, bypassed, flaccid. I do have beauty-sex inside; you do speak
beauty-sex tapped on bulbous tumored breasts by iron levers; I can hear
you. Oh, my beauty-poems. Cock and toes rot; nails fall off feet; there is
fluid leaked from suppurated mattress sores. I write beauty-lines. Help
me.
