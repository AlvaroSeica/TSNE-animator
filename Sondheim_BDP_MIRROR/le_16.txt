God, by Jennifer


Jennifer: He makes me speak Nicely but I can't write Interesting because
God knows Everything and I have nothing Interesting to tell Him! But He
will forgive me! He is God and knows how GOOD I am! He does! Oh I can't
write about Him in such a good style! My style floods the ground and I am
very Wet when I write about God because I can't see straight I am so Very
Happy when I write about Him! He is GOOD to me! Oh! I want to write about
God! I really do! I am so wondrous because I am Good and God Loves me! I
can't even hold my Breath so hard when I write about Him and His Wonders!
I can't believe He loves me! goodness! happiness in prayer fulfillment!
Would Oh! I want to write about God! I really do! I am so wondrous because
I am Good and God Loves me! I can't even hold my Breath so hard when I
write about Him and His Wonders! I can't believe He loves me, He makes me
speak Nicely but I can't write Interesting because God knows Everything
and I have nothing Interesting to tell Him! But He will forgive me! He is
God and knows how GOOD I am! He does with us! Ah, accumulations with run-
time kludges!
