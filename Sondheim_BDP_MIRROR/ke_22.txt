you


projecting into the interior of my mind,
upon the screen of my mind's interior, I see
you and several others congregating
around a fire or other projection of you,
or mind, or waters where you will sail away

and there is a projection on the sail, of you,
of others on the screen of my mind's interior,
in or on the waters, the drinking boat, grey sky,
there the waters where you sail away

and you, I call, hey you, I am on your screen,
sailing away with your grey others gathered
around a fire, it is beautiful in boats and fires,
beautiful in waters, grey skies black
with stars, with boats and fires and oceans

and please make sounds, speak clearly,
and I will hear your sounds, please make
some images as well, there, on the boat,
drunken and lurching through the seas,
on the waters of our mind's interior,
in the blackness of forgotten stars

and you are on your sails, you are on them,
and I am on you, sailing away in my mind's interior,
and there's a fire, we are gathered around,
watching a fire projected on the fire, you see
me projected onto me, you see the others,
grey and on the others, you see yourself, I say,
in the middle of the waters fuelled
by the blackness of forgotten stars

and where is everyone, and why,
and what is gathering, what do you see,
you will look down, I say, look down, you do,

you see me on the screen of my interior,
I see your mind's interior, and you see me
on the others grey and gathered near the fire,

and you, you see yourself, and I see you
in the middle of the waters fuelled
by the blackness of forgotten stars
