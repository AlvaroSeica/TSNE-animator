little poem

my dammed-up, my held-back, my repressed:
my bones impede the marrow-marrow flow:
wet and lovely juice:net:net:net:net:net:
your mesh throughout is outside my mesh.
my mesh throughout is inside your mesh.
your you connects my mesh - oh so using
this juiced and wondrous marrow-marrow-flow.
