i relinquish my hold on the world
what has been familiar, now is difficult, strange
there is an awkwardness about gravity - I had not noticed this before
something peculiar about the disappearance of the stars as well
you can't tell the trouble you'll be in by jumping
land is always tilting, something i noticed for the first time
in a great backwards woosh like wrong-way through a telescope
enfolded in the loving embrace of the world everywhere penetrating
relinquishment is difficult in a land otherwise unlistening
less than suddenly, the quiet opening of a great colorless space
things are so awkward, having corners, invisible bottoms
across the top, other things peering, just as present
how do i know how do i know
wondering why the winds never fall down towards the bottom of things
sun across everywhere, not beneath my feet
i keep returning from gravity, and gravity follows
the world is so neat, the stars and galaxies wonderfully clean
noticing how awkward shadows are as well, just like other things
what troubles await someone quietly sitting
having relinquished, don't follow me, you'll be amazing, happy
