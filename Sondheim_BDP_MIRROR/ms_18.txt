we have many weapons of mass destruction. they can destroy by air, sea, or
land. they can also destroy by water, which is part of sea, and earth, of
which there is biology. biology is a good means of mass destruction. we
have built many facilities of souring nourishment. we have ill disease 
facilities as well of many cold and flu vaccines. of air we have rockets 
and other things that push themselves up in the air and cast great shadows 
of them over the land. we will have floating things that look like great 
and small bubbles in water and other things like oil, they will float in 
that, they are not proud (?), which will cover the skin of many people, 
and they will have to bathe.

some of these are still in development stage, such as ill disease floating 
thing and rocket biology mass. some of them are as tiny arms against great 
walls which push and push, they will do nothing by one, but all together, 
they will make walls bend, and perhaps they will fall over. 

some of these are wonderful projects in mind and we are think of ways to 
do them or just to talk about, which is very scary, for example to float 
man and woman on sand or fold their dreams so they meet on other side. we 
are very glad to make large painting in sand which is very frightful to 
airplanes, looks like a great giant person
