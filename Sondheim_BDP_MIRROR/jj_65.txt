Christine, I had a dream that we were driving through
Tonides and in
Tonides we almost divided against the fast car, that
Tonides was a why, McCarthy formalism, that if
Tonides, then _come_ else _go,_ or that if
Tonides, everything's beautiful and in this
Tonides dream, I asked only "whose decision," for
Tonides' beautiful impunity, where there were spined

and other plants to wear brown aureoles 
upon the brow, the hair, the shirt, the oracular arm
for luck of whatever sort Tonides might bring,
for luck of whatever sort Tonides might bring.
