The Most True of All I want to Say


You don't say anything much anymore but you watch and read and you're very
careful in what you write and you take _note._ And what you _note_ is that
everyone writes to _me,__ whoever I am; that _I_ am at the end of every
post and every text, every aside and every response. _I_ am absent from
the bed, _I_ am just around the corner, _I_ am always reading, always
watching - or _I_ am never reading, never watching.

Indeed, would you write to _me_ if I were reading? Isn't every post a cry
for _me,_ public in the absence of my presence, the absence of reply? 

I am not in the bed, I are not in the room, I are not in the home, I
am not down the street, in the town or city, in the province. Or I am
_not,_ there is no me, a knot of me, a tangle. 

My absence makes your presence, your presence, hopeless. Since I do not
find you, since I do not find you pathetic, you are as such. Since I do
not find you, you are the written of the dead. 

Now I will put a stamp on this and mail it out, says Jennifer.
