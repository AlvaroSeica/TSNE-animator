I don't mean what I say.
I'm in no condition to assign meaning to these words.
These words are meaningless to me.
Words mean nothing to me.
Pay no attention to what I am saying because I have no idea what I am
saying.
These lines mean nothing to me because they are meaningless.

To mean something, meaning has to have a frame to hang on.
These lines have nothing to hang on.
I have lost the ability to assign frames to meaning or meaning to frames.
I don't know what I'm saying.
