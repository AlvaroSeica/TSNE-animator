[This constitutes the first 3 pages. Punctuation has been preserved. The
fourth page is handwritten and contains a diagram, Module interaction for
a Telnet-logger Connection. The date on this is 12-May-71; both are from
Harvard. The diagram demonstrates the central role of the IMP, NCP, Data
Control, and Logger modules, as well as Server and User Processes.

Thanks to Peter H. Salus for the xerox. It's unclear whether the diagram
is part of the Guide. Salus states that Guide is "four pages long," but
the diagram is dated later, and is not necessary for access. The third
page ends half-way down. 

I recommend Salus' Casting the Net; he is also producing two larger vol-
umes on the early history of the Net, which will include various repro-
duced documents.
