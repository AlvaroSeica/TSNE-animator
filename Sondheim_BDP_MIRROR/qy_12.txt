Notes on Analog and Digital

Analog breakdown of distribution laws - Land Experiments:
What constitutes illusion? Is it an illusion if the 'real' is 
reconstructed? (Land experiments, also Jeremy's bot)
Analog - Complexity of the violin (The Violin Explained, Beament)
 -- modes of bridge vibration for example
 -- catastrophe theory - where the digital is forced
Thinking of the origins of music, speech, the absent body,
phenomenology, inordinately complex acoustics, 'making music together,'
muscle memory - Not Heidegger, but Husserl's internal time conscious-
ness, Schutz' relevance strata, but not dissolution, falling-apart at
every turn.
Varied consciousnesses of varied strata.
Widely varied time dilations and contractions, body centered.
Free jazz aesthetics. 
Improvisation is possible on computer: within SL for example.
Tacit knowledge and Leder's absent body: relation to speech or playing
an instrument. Somatic difference between improvisation and score.
