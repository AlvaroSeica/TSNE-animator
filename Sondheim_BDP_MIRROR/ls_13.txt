Was XAA00952* destroyed; delivered? Was there a recipient after all? 
Did it end in /dev/null? Was it the beginning of incipient terror?
Was there a sender after all? Did it constitute a dissemination?
Did it breathe? Was it an empty signifier? Did it constitute the aim
and presence of pure destruction? Was its priority of the highest,
beyond the scale; of the lowest, below the scale - below the absent
letter, vulnerable to imminent destruction? Was it of any size, no
size at all? Was it a proper or improper name? Has it taken leave?
