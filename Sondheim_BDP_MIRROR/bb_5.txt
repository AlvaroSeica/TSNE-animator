ii GEAR, PLANETARY,

because this is a century like no other, a movement towards the organic,
the demechanization of the world - Lucy Lippard's dematerialization app-
lied across the boundaries of culture productions, into the sphere of
everyday life. Miniaturization is no longer nanotechnological in its main
thrust (already a change from a year ago!) - instead, the field concerns
itself with an _omnipresent sentient environment,_ interpenetrating the
given, however that may be defined. In fact, the changeover is occurring
so rapidly that it is impossible to chart even short-term socio-cultural
effects. 

Think of this - it is not even certain where the _physical_ environment 
per se will be located - neural interfacing, for example, might lead to a 
domain of information, just as cyberspace's virtuality is problematic in 
relation to older lived environments (in spite of novels, etc.). In this 
regard, a new topology/topography comes into existence, a self-sustaining 
world of geomatics, i.e. with geomatics foundations, paralleling those 
created through MOO programming language.

In spite of _symptoms,_ there is no precedent for this; no wonder S/M has 
become so popular, carrying attributes of worlds to one another across a 
simultaneous insistence on the body _and_ its simulacra. (So many models: 
cyborgian, prosthetics, robotics, remote-sensing, viral, artifical life 
and intelligence...)
