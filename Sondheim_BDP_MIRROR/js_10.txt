Jennifer continues with some {k}1: prompting:


Between zero and one is all the difference in the world. But the differ-
ence has no presence, until ||, establishing duplication, equivalence, the
heap. Zero and one, |, have no heap in the first/last place, the place
which is no/place, or rather, the place which is ontologically designated. 
Between zero and one, ontology, shifting from a hermeneutics of absence to
a phenomenology of presence vis-a-vis domain. Of course, Jennifer saith,
with zero and the one, all and never are domains.

It's || that establishes the domain, no other gods before me. This is a
place which is epistemologically designated. It takes induction to extend
into the infinite, transfinite. It takes the three little dots, ... .

Between zero and one, totality struggles, emerges. Purified by zero, uni-
fied by one. Between | and ||, the rupture of the other appears, dirtied
by zero, dispersed by ||.

So saith Jennifer-curtsey.
