Teaching the Internet

Teach them to suck their credit cards for a wild wild ride! 
Get them fed to the hacker sites as fast as they can type!
Have them churn their .sigs in the bot-machines of IRC!
Show them the violence of Net cash as they buy P8s on spec!
Strip them with Net sex, beguile them with future love and nakedness!
Throw them into HotWired to learn the kewlest sounds!
Telnet them into gender-change obscurity of MUD ORC-killer options!
Make them hop across Gopher, Archie, Jughead, Veronica, oh why bother?
Send them to teacher Alan, to find the best new URLs!
Weave their warp and woof wiped with World Wide Web!
Hold their hands while fingering each and every one!
Thrust them into IRC strip-teased, no panty flood protection!
Turn them loose on alt.flame.newbie, subject to cursing hordes!
Ask them to email Alan with deepest darkest sex and childhood tales!
Tell them to traceroute themselves all the way to Unix shelled-out ~home!
Beg them to sing another talker tune while gods snoop with delight!
Order their home-page cracked, repeated with a thousand frames!
Delete them, @toad them, kiss them all with lips of cyber-ruby-red!
Transform them into one another, membrane-deep in IRC!
Throw them out of home-directory with nowhere left to go!
Root them from the root! 
Toss them in the /bin!
Write to their a.db!
And rm -r their core!
