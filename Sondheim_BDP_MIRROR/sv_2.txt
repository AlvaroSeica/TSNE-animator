Autobiography

my revised autobiography:

new materials, emendations

I'm never sure what to include here, how much to give 
away, how much an anonymous audience can be trusted,
how much trust has to do with anything I've written.
In any case, it was time for updating and this might
be of interest to you.


 


Auto-biography or biog.txt

disclaimer: information as true as I can make it. please back-channel any 
and all corrections. certainly my memory may be faulty (see 1996 and the 
Sartre reference); there are spelling errors, errors of omission, distor- 
tions, repressions, sublimations; there are errors of remorse, errors of 
hallucination, of dream- or virtual-worlds. no errors are intentional, 
none are designed to be hurtful, vengeful, 'setting the record straight.' 
(there are no records to set straight, there are recordings, they set 
nothing. there are no clues, no cues.) 

further - there are reconstructions, reconfigurations; memories haunt me, 
increasing frequency and my sense of the obdurate. Time transforms into 
thing; no wonder myths of afterlife and rebirth proliferate - this is the 
dubious gift of reliving narratives which may never have existed, but 
which appear to carry the concrete weight of the world. Memories transform 
into inert substance, a form of hardness, as one grows distant from them. 
One is fashioned by the fashioning of them.
