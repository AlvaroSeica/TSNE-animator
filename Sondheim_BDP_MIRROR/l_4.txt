Heidegger


Some questions concerning Heidegger in light of Heidegger, From Metaphys-
ics to Thought, Janicaud and Mattei: 

Does Heidegger's work produce floating speech, theology? Who are those 
"divine ones" floating around with the fourfold? 

Why does Heidegger find Being so troublesome?

Didn't this man _ever_ discuss politics after 1945?

In the section of the book, Heidegger in New York, Janicaud presents a 
fictitious dialog:

"Francis: What about the divine ones?

"Sue: They are more abstract than Rilke's Angel, and so anemic that I see 
no thunder or laughter ever quickening them into life.

"Francis: Well, at least with them possibilities loom within our deserted 
sky. 

"David: But why should we always privilege the simple as the sign of the 
enigma?"

Heidegger would have disapproved of the technological implementation of 
the divine ones; I disapprove of any other.

Consider technology implementing the divine ones retroactively. This is 
the bootstrap method of creating the human, time travel by proxy.

But the enigma in fact is Heidegger, isn't it? Here's this man whose 
mentor was Husserl, who was fucking with Hannah Arendt, throwing his 
Dasein into the Nazi maelstrom, tripping over himself. 

So why didn't he say something later? Even walking around the forest in 
that absurd outfit of his? Did he have television?

Martin?
