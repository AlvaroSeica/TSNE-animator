[What I'm talking about, with video and image, later today,
12/2/13, at UMN, Judaism as it relates to my work. Beginning
with quotes from Hillel in Avot of Rabbi Natan, end perhaps
with live examples. If there were more time, I'd be applying
back-to-front transformations, as well as the elimination of
duplicate words - mimicking and enlarging upon the entanglement
of speech and creation. There is only so much time. Thanks to
Maria Damon, Sandy Baldwin, Foofwa d'Imobilite, Maud Liardon,
Azure Carter, examples and performances from everywhere. You 
may have seen much of this text; I keep refining, recreating
the original from the debris of origination, such as it is.]



TALK-THROUGH


THE BOOK
THE MACHINE AND TRANSFORMATION
THE PAIN
THE ABYSS AND DELIQUENCY OF PAIN
THE CAMP AND THE TUMULT AMONG THE ABYSS
THE VIRTUAL WHICH IS NO ESCAPE
PAIN AND DEATH AMONG THE VIRTUAL
THE CHARRED BODY AND THE UNNAMING
OUR VIRTUAL
THE BENT BODY OF THE BOOK: THE BENT BODY OF CHAGALL,
MODIGLIANI, SOUTINE. 
THE CORRODED BODY OF SOUTINE, CHAGALL.
THE WALKING DEAD IN THE CAMPS.
THE TUMULT EVERYWHERE IN THE FACE OF SCARCITY
 AND UNBELIEVABLE WEALTH. 
THE CHILD SOLDIER. BLOOD TECHNOLOGIES.
THE EXTINCTIONS OF THE RAINFORESTS AND OCEANS.
ANNIHILATION: TO THE LIMIT.

IF I AM NOT FOR MYSELF, WHO THEN? IF NOT NOW, WHEN?

As a Jew, I am an unbeliever.

A Jew _must_ be an unbeliever: the Jew testifies to the silence
  of God.

All my work stems out of the discrepency of care - how can one
care in the (literal) face of death?

So I begin as an aetheist, but a haunted one, haunted by ghosts
and my own habitus as a (non-existent, therefore Godlike) ghost
of the future - which resonates, haunts me _now_ - my short life
- like all of ours - (ours, but not of our own possessing) coming to
an end.
