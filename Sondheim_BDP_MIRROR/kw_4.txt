this full and empty space


writing online, with biff y, mesg y, I allow myself the pleasure of in-
tervention; the editor becomes porous, messages and requests passing,
passing through it. I keep the _leave_ command on as well, which begins
sending me messages fifty minutes into the session, hurtles them faster
and faster until fifty-five minutes are up. Perhaps in another window ICQ
is open - but what I'm speaking about now is _this_ window in the shell
account, and its transparency in relation to the activity of the online
world.

words and commands and requests for ytalk enter through apparent openings
in the screen surface, which is the potential surface of the editor it-
self. there is a flow through my writing, often peripheral to the intended
content, modifying it languorously.

there is a flow through the shimmering of skins, emergences interweaving
with these processes of cold construction. this is still another version
of the performative of online language, where each sign may be replaced by
any other, through portals drawing my attention elsewhere.

to theorize this, in the midst of incoming fire...
