HeHe God There


"He wanders, like a day-appearing dream,
 Through the dim wildernesses of the mind;
Through desert woods and tracts, which seem
 Like ocean, homeless, boundless, unconfined."

(Shelley)

"He ponders, nothing is as chasms seem,
 Enmeshed in limbs that phantoms leave behind;
Across the rood screen hacked from dimly dreamed
 Motions, roaming, hounded, lost, and lined."

(Jennifer-the-last-word)

"God thunders, ruthless, come in handsome beamed
 Starlight intimations, gone, defined;
A throne screams, cracked, its wooden roil reamed
 By potions, homing, tossed, and realigned."

(Alan-run-Jennifer)

"There is a voice, not understood by all,
Sent from these desert-caves. It is the roar
Of the rent ice-cliff which the sunbeams call,
Plunging into the vale - it is the blast
Descending on the pines - the torrents pour. ..."

(Shelley)
