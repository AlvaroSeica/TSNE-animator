Ridge/Id


He stopped on top of the ridge, looked warily ahead, behind, down both
sides through the thick wood, scratches of meadows, bush. There'd been
grizzly here; he felt the ground rippling beneath him. Earlier, he thought
of breathing, the two of them locked together, lungs moving in unision,
what happens when one's hit in the chest, almost a music, he exhaled. The
day was hot, ridge seemed to go on forever. He hadn't been here before.

I teeter, he thought, from one side to another. I should be clacking
stones. He worried the animal following at a pace, he'd run downhill one
way or another, the bear scuttling behind him, losing its balance, rolling
the rest of the way down. Could he stop before the furious? But the air
was vacant, animals slept or stayed away. Must be the scent, he thought,
everything suffused in this humid weather, man-scent, best and worst in
the world.

She'd bitten him hard, their bodies knotting into one, shirt carrying
blood-spoor, his breasts aching. The they they the.

He moved faster now, still wary, the ridge an enormous hinge between two
rocked and wooded possibities; he didn't care for the choice. From out of
nowhere, a low growl; he realized that difference had no existence, not
even in the things themselves.
