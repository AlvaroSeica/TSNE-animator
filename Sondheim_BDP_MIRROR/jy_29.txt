Jennifer's Ponder


"Such moments of these, like the falling of peas, take us away / From the
norm!"

Jennifer ponders: "Such moments _of_ these" (her emphasis)? Moments of
what, perhaps, what came before in the poem? Mead, storm, and ruins and
some other stuff, perhaps the drops of blood, there was an implication of
a castle, certainly a fortress, god knows what else. Not to mention (why
not?) the arthropods ...

But then, hmmm ... 

"Such moments _like_ these, _like_ the falling of peas" does seem to over-
do it, these moments don't have to double up, quite, but they do! Hee hee!

So she considers "take us away from the norm!" might absorb (like her pan-
ties in a puddle!) the grammar that came before, just a bit off-putting.

And lets it alone, but wanted you to know this all along ...
