Derrida, Heidegger


"Lely comments that, although lesser degrees of coprolagnia (pleasure in 
smelling, pleasure in the apprehension of traces of excrement) are not 
uncommon, 'the coprolagnic aberration carried to its ultimate excesses' 
(that is, coprophagia) is extremely rare. Just as Blanchot sees the 
libertines' 'normal' focus to be on the traces of the murderous passion, 
on the potential for murder and not on the corpse as corpse; so too the 
hint of shit, the trace of shit, ought to be more titillating than the 
full brute presences of the lifeless turd." ... "The turd will not be 
_auf-gehoben._" (Jane Gallop, Intersections, a Reading of Sade with 
Bataille, Blanchot, and Klossowski.)


The _trace of shit_ nicely neutralizes the body, signing it as epitaph, 
as neutralized; the spun-out mind revolves around itself, tethered, not 
to death, but to the signifier beaten-out. The trace wrytes itself across 
the body; Peirce's sheet of assertion becomes the dirty-sheet, in need of 
cleansing. The dirty little girl, dirty little boy, escape the planet 
only to be rewritten by it. _It_ wrytes. _It_ wrytes and wrytes.


"That does not mean (to say) that there is no castration, but that this
_there is_ does not take place. There is the that one cannot cut through
to a decision between the two contrary and recognized functions of the
fetish, any more than between the thing itself and its supplement. Any
more than between the sexes." "The tongue remains in the sheath," 
(Jacques Derrida, Glas.)


The horizon and achievement of the fetysh is the decathected body.
