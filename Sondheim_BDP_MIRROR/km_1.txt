I am stale; there is nothing to ail
this body that has not done its damage
much as this body has done homage
to language, pillage which is stale
as in before, when you have read it
whispered in my ear; then I'd write it,
no need to read it further, you'd been bit
by what you steer to me; then through me,
back again, that's what is stale, theor-
y, me, and you, binding without fail
what would unglue me, become stale, fear
it winding that trail, cuing the near-
ly stale or train of mind, cycle and rail,
what could entail a natural kind.
