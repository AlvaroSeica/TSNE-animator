(but I think after all is said and done,
  there will be a girl called Jennifer
    who will remember just about everything
      because there will be nothing else 
        but Jennifer and her frock remembering
          in her sweet age in her own sweet time

o land of hostile rebellion, insurrection will bear thee well, thrive -
richly, thou bearest in abundance. wind and hurricane, thou lapse into
silence in the midst of the storm, from thy seat of adoration. Gladness

royal chair and throne. the regent, saddled of horse and ass, from his
wornout bed, calls to thee; placed upon his bosom are the signs of south
and signs of north. "mu lugal-bi, in-pad-de-es," They swore in the name
of their king." Jen-if-er-sal.
