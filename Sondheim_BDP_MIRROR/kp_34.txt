s/ms (notes, directives)


[textualities]

s/ms as 'rough raster': transformations of vowels into consonants: every
such transformation decreases information and entropy.

s/ms as 'interferences': transformations on the plane of content: in rela-
tion to expectations, hence increasing information and entropy.

s/ms as 'global' or 'local transformations': reversals, inversions, doub-
lings and splits, hence contents + rules.

s/ms as 'foreign bodies': transformations on the level of insertions.

s/ms as 'resonances': transformations on the levels of echos and duplica-
tions, hence deconstructions of communications on the planes of content
and structures.

[bodies and others]

s/ms as 'scalable': hence part-objects, apparent full-objects, ranges from
letter substitutions to avatars to selves.

s/ms as 'dependencies' or 'independencies': viral, encased, cocooned,
splayed, emissions, dormancies.

s/ms as 'drives' or 'impulsions' or 'neutralities': submergences, emerg-
ences, emergencies, tunnelings.

s/ms as 'singularities' or 'multiplicities': sprays, atmospherics, the
algebra of linkages and couplings, concatenations and substitutions.

s/ms as 'members': eyes, mouths, fingers, legs, teeth, holes, plugs.

s/ms as 'controls': bondages, knots, sheaves, sadisms, ideological part-
objects, masochisms, dominations, colonial and endocolonial part-objects.
