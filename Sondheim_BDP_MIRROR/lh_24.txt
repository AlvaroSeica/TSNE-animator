What would happen if I were blind, Nikuko asked Izanagi. You can see per-
fectly, replied Izanagi. Of course I can, said Nikuko. And I have all my
other senses as well. Do you think the gods have more senses than humans,
asked Izanagi. Do you think we are gods, asked Nikuko. Humans have five
senses, said Izanagi, and they are smell, taste, sight, hearing, and touch
in that order. Why in that order, asked Nikuko. Because they must smell
what they taste, although they are afraid of it, and what it might say to
move them, answered Izanagi. We have eight senses, said Nikuko, because we
can determine hot from cold, tall from short, high from deep, truth from
falsehood, and soft from hard. That makes ten senses, said Izanagi, Ah,
said Nikuko, but do we truly taste what we smell, are not both the most
intimate form of touch for us? And as for blindness, added Nikuko, for me,
sight is the least important sense of all; I walk and speak with eyes
closed, talk without looking at my neighbor, and listen to the world in
the silence of the night. Sight is overrated, said Izanagi; I haven't seen
for years. Perhaps there's nothing to look at, replied Nikuko.
