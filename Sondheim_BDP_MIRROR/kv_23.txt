Suspense, then Tragedy


It's impossible! Hurry! They're all around us! I can't see them! There's
got to be a better way to earn a living! Let's get out of here! But how
are we supposed to do that! They've got the whole place sealed off! You
stay here; if I don't return in ten minutes, go for help! Wait, I'm going
with you! You can't, it's too dangerous! I've come this far; I'm not going
back! Ok, but be careful! Please have patience! The moment is close at
hand! You don't have to tell me this! Watch out! They're circling back
around us! I never asked you for anything! Watch your rear! Come on! Hold
your fire! Wait! They've got someone! Let the girl go! She means nothing
to me! Throw down your weapons! Ok, just don't shoot! Wait, you don't need
to do this! They've got him! Now! Run for it! Now! Go! I'll catch up with
you later! I love you! I love you too! Later we'll have kids and that
picket fence you've always wanted! They've got me! You've got to continue
on without me! Promise me this! She's dead! He's dead! They're all dead!
