     Keeping track of the time, by Jennifer, looking around:


     /usr/local/bin/ntpdate -b noc.near.net timeserver.cs.umb.edu
     clock.psu.edu
     5 Jun 23:32:41 ntpdate: bind() fails: Permission denied

     /from man pages for ntpdate used by panix.com etc./
     Time adjustments are made by ntpdate in one of two ways.  If
     ntpdate  determines  your  clock  is  off  by  more than 0.5
     seconds it will simply step the time by  calling  settimeof-
     day(2).   If the error is less than 0.5 seconds, however, it
     will by default slew the clock's time via  a  call  to  adj-
     time(2)  with the offset.  The latter technique is less dis-
     ruptive and more accurate when  the  offset  is  small,  and
     works  quite well when ntpdate is run by cron (8) every hour
     or two.  The adjustment made in the latter case is  actually
     50%  larger than the measured offset since this will tend to
     keep a badly drifting clock more accurate (at  some  expense
     to stability, though this tradeoff is usually advantageous).
     At boot time, however, it is usually better to  always  step
     the time.  This can be forced in all cases by specifying the
     -b switch on the command line.  The -s switch tells  ntpdate
     to log its actions via the syslog(3) facility rather than to
     the standard output, a useful option when running  the  pro-
     gram from cron(8).

                     Welcome to the WWW Clock Home Page
 
     Welcome to the very first functioning clock on the WWW. Here you
     will be able to find useful web pages which are fully functioning
     clocks. Right now we have pages for Pacific Daylight Time. The
     Rubber Chicken is hosting Eastern Standard Time.
 
     Greenwich Mean Time is: 02:48 AM

/This was found by trying www.time.net and www.time.org. There are many
other clocks online, including one which counts down to the millennium./

/At one point, she/I wrote that "Jennifer has all the time in the world."
It might be accurate to say she serves time, or that time serves her, that
there is a distinction or contradistinction at work here. That we are
flooded by time, but that she is not; that she is working over time, in a
manner of writing / speaking. Which is true for the uneasy condition or
presence or projection of anything in this space. If I am her dream, she
is mine; if I am bound by this site/sight before the screen, she is un-
bound within a matrix whose inhabitation I can scarcely comprehend. I do
find her a wonder, I do, I do, I do.
