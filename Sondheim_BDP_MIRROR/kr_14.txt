Fierce Theodor has wrought this sonnet.
Norn walked to Valkyrie, true fey Princess
lost in Mordor's distance, wilt thou say
I abjure rumor lost and truth regained. I
speak of Mordor's legions, O charmful
Magister, of fired visage, know thou what
Norn will speak, in light of tongueless
Norn, in light of mouthless Norn and 
speechless Norn? The Portal formed the
Wander of many a fey Princess; I formed
them, they formed them. Would that Sorcery
have no role but obvious Sincerity; would
Upper and Nether World clash at volcanic
Rim, defeat of legionnaire and Norn alike.
