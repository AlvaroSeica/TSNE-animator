collaboration


collaboration between two dying writers
collaboration on the lam from the law
collaboration marching from kosovo
collaboration wounded in east timor
collaboration beneath earthquake
in free fire zone, collaboration
in mountain fire zone, collaboration
collaboration among prisoners
collaboration between rival gangs
in the mine-fields of pennsylvania, collaboration
the last breath, you against the light, collaborating
collaborating with friends
collaborating with the enemy
oh hiroshima mon amour
to collaborate among the ruins of the atomic bomb
insistent on the lyric after auschwitz, collaboration
among my jews, collaboration
among my neo-nazis, collaboration
collaboration in the last words ever spoken
collaboration among the last tears, the last sigh
collaboration at a loss for words
war-time and collaboration
and of great beauty and moons wheeling, collaboration
there are so many things i want to tell you
there are so many things i must say to you before I die this morning, this
evening, this night
there are so many things, there is so little time to say them
you will see my last tears, you will hear beyond my hearing
you will walk and leave this room of the dying
you will carry with you
