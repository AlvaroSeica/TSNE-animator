Julu Twine transformed from my encounter, inhabiting Julu Twine. 
S/he, my 2nd avatar, had extensive alpha transparencies; now 
when I returned as hir, I found hir with a new outfit and body, 
which I didn't create or use or even see before. It's unnerving; 
what sort of intercession has this been, between one session and 
the next? What has been done to hir? And what, if anything, does 
this say about race in America? Black Lives Matter in virtual 
worlds as well; I'm torn between promulgation on my part, and 
violation on someone else's, perhaps myself? Did I violate 
myself? Did I somehow inherit this body, this outfit, as a gift 
or grief from another participant in Second Life? Did I accept 
this? Did I assume these contents as confluent with my own 
avatar, Julu Twine? Does Julu Twine run me? Do I run Julu Twine? 
Am I deeply forgetful here? Is that possible? Perhaps I accepted 
the transformation gladly, transformed hir myself? The image/ 
imaginary is uncanny, does not respond to my animations 
(technically, it locks them out, unless they're attached to 
object scripts). I don't know who did this; was it myself, was 
it meant as a prank, deep gift, was I aware of what I am not 
aware of, now?

But it is in fact, a package, the first in a choose an avatar 
panel, a commercial construct; I can only conclude, that when 
the Second Life browser updated, it removed the attributes I 
assigned to Julu Twine (including attachments, illuminations, 
activations, texture mappings, transparencies, scripts, and 
alphas, all my creations) in favor of a packaged imaginary of 
race and sexuality, which becomes even more problematic. On the 
other hand, I have no proof that the updating, read Linden Labs, 
did this; it might well have been an intruder. At least I 
realize now, it hasn't been my own depressive conscience at work 
- when anomaly appears in the world, look towards capital as at 
least one of the underlying causes.

oh in case the nohere.mov stops or doesn't loop please go to the 
nohere/ directory. these are fashion/able Neighborhood photo- 
graphs of NOH - Julu Twine in a brand new outfit discernibly 
awkward in relation to the old. S/he is in our Neighborhood, 
Not Our Hood, Not Only here, Noh were. Everything in fashion is 
garnered by repetition, interstitial assignations, Barthes' 
semiotics detailing the foundations of the body. Of course, 
beyond fashion, the body has no foundations, only interiority; 
here July Twine has only exteriority, coding and protocols all 
the way down. There is only here here. Here here curls like a 
crazed Riemannian manifold greeting itself in the repetition of 
capital. There is nothing to enjoy in these images, which are 
available to everyone for hundreds of dollars, individually, or 
as a set, gratis.

Upond, the Neighborhood Pond

water sloughed from shores of pond or quiet pools, darkening 
Nikuko across Ohori-Koen, bridged the pond on the stone-bridge, 
form saguaro and pond growth; life begins its long cycling into 
still-born mist rising from the carp pond .. the railings of 
shallows following the pond that wasn't there now or then or was 
it her inferiors - the thicket will rise up, the pond become a 
great flood, and at midnight, and the sound of wood stork 
winging, - the drowning pool of thought - the rusting pond of 
mindful thinking - among a spacious and distant wilderness - ice 
and heat - odd phenomena - winds moving inconceivably slowly, 
here and across the pond, lower, and lower still, O! storm a 
river, lying at her feet, a lake, a stream, a rivulet, a 
trickle, a pond, a sea, an ocean - all these soundings - and of 
Jennifer - she says - a pond an ocean, an ocean an unpleasant 
one, and nothing sounds in water but of Jennifer! says Jennifer 
says I! n a lake a pond a ocean. a ocean a storm a river. they 
lie at her feet n a lake a pond an ocean. when you among a 
stream a storm a river. they lie at her feet n a lake a pond an 
a pond a ocean. a ocean a unpleasant one. nothing sounds in 
water but her feet in a stream a storm a river. they lie at her 
feet n a lake a pond storm a river. they lie at her feet n a 
lake a pond an ocean. when you - in infamy - in bondage - when 
you dwell within the calm and full - the strutting universe of 
me already calm and still and full

and full silence falls silence, and blossoms thrive, and fall



the redolent cellular automata and fractal debris

these older programs are running in dosbox in linux mint; i 
wrote them originally in qbasic. some of them are fractal, some 
are cellular automata, some entangled i was exploring everything 
from wolfram's take on automata in a new kind of science, to 
pattern recognition. the programs run great in dosbox, but it 
stops screen-grabs; the images and video are from an external 
camera. the frack video and image is oddly redolent of a 
swastika, which unnerved me, and led to the processed images.

the programs are relatively simple and lead to complex results. 
they operate on an x,y plane, although i also worked with 3d 
models of the same. i'm fascinated by the traces things leave in 
the world, the relationship of traces to evanescent and fragile. 
the estimates of the number of life-forms on the planet have 
increased almost beyond belief, the largest perhaps at four 
trillion. better to think of dynamic and overriding processes, 
absorbing and restructuring everything constantly, speciation as 
the establishing of temporary plateaus with fuzzy boundaries and 
terrain. all of this is a mystery and fantasy on my part; every- 
thing i think is farthest from the truth.

like ourselves, the tree doubles itself for companionship, so
badly wants the truth of romanticism, already gone as the world
curls inward, almost touch itself and those around us

again working on the borders of interpretation, the semblance 
of law, structures, interpretations, deep elsewhere as deep 
ecology, dissolution, abjections, corrosions, part-objects, 
entanglements in-search-of, surge, blank fulfillments

over and over again, covering, recovering, uncovering the 
same ground. i will grow old with death on my hands. i will
not grow old. i will not protest the grave. i will wake 
elsewhere with illumination. i will awaken with brilliance 
and a sense of righteous investigation. i will awaken with 
azure by my side. i will awaken.

over and over again, working within the edgespace of inter-
pretation, no longer the tired hunt for justice, only the law, 
the law, the law.
