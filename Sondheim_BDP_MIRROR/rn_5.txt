W-boson's End

http://www.alansondheim.org/W-bosonend.jpg

"W bosons can decay to a lepton and neutrino or to an up-type quark and a 
down-type quark. The decay width of the W boson to a quark.antiquark pair 
is proportional to the corresponding squared CKM matrix element and the 
number of quark colours, NsubC = 3." (Wikipedia)

Towards the end everything breaks up, ruptures, reconstitutes. 
Muscles trembling, giving out, the hand readjusting, cramping.
Pains holding the rishi in place collapsing rhythms.
Fake rhythms taking their place in the midst of uncontrollable pauses.
Messaging of the body coming forth through unavoidable cosmos.
Seeing it here towards the end, then the ghost appearing.
Appearing and hungering, ghosting the strings of the oud.
