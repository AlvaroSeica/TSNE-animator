Mountains


Mountains have slopes and mountaineers live on them. The horizon of the
slope for Jennifer-mountaineer slopes away from Jennifer on average, on
right and on left. The rising horizon /we shall rise again/ points towards
a peak not a curtain. On the average, above, and below, a bending towards
the angle of the _acute._ I have learned that level floors are propped
from beneath by beams towards the vertical and thereupon at an acute angle
with the lower slope.

Understand this is an average, just like the Greenland icecap slope tilts
everything towards the thinning edges. Above all, beneath all of it.

I can imagine these intersecting slopes; mountains are not height, says
Jennifer-mountaineer, but tilts, almost planar, crags and cwms included.
She says, I can't feel gravity-pull-oneway-down, but the weight takes care
of that.

Trees make acute angles looking up, obtuse looking down. Such obtuse gran-
deur from a height which permits no acquaintance. What my next videotape
will be, she insists, is this matter of the planes and slopes. I've tilted
my monitor-next. (What's granular and grand? Where's the grain of the
voice in the echo? What's the weight of violation-fabric? Why can't I lean
against the mountain?)

She lays her head down on the pillow, her frame later conforming to the
bed.
