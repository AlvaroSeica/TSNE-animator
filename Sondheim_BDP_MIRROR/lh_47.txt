No one will remember us, said Nikuko. Izanagi replied, There's always the
myths of origin, and Nikuko replied, that's good for you. But, and Izanagi
said, there's the other one, Izanami, what we made together, and Nikuko
said, I never heard of Izanami, and Izanagi said, she's recorded, and Ni-
kuko replied, perhaps I will take her name, in this and all other worlds,
and Izanagi said, that is what we will do, we will be known together from
the very beginning, when we were naming and touching each other said Iza-
nami, and Izanagi replied, we will be turning, and here, and there are the
pages, we will be confused, replied Izanami, such is the making of worlds,
said Izanagi and Izanami, I will leave you now. They continued walking in
the direction of Satsuma, in the direction of Izumo, in the direction of
Ise, in the direction of Hyuga they continued on their way.
