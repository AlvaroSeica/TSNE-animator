Travis in Cyberspace





Travis couldn't sleep. He hadn't written anything, hadn't done anything

today.  I couldn't sleep. I hadn't written anything, hadn't done anything

today. Travis wandered in the midst of the verbs and nouns, allowed him-

self to be modified by the adjectival. Conjunction, I wandered in the

midst of the verbs and nouns, allowed myself to be modified. He knew it

wasn't real. I knew it wasn't real. Conjunction, he knew it was as real as

it was going to get. I knew it was as real as it was going to get. His

life was unspeakable. My life was unspeakable. Travis would stop thinking

in words and he would stop thinking. I would stop thinking in words and I

would stop thinking. Conjunction how did he discover that words were his

thinking. How did I discover that words were my thinking. How did he dis-

cover anything. How did I discover anything. 



There were gaps where he stopped thinking and he couldn't remember them. 

But there were these gaps.
