If I can't write, I won't be able to wait for you, O Existence!
I am afraid of opposites, each and everywhere.:W$ltlng:

transforms Your Tha faallng th$t flash h$s laft ma,
th$t bpnas $ra hald by phpnamas np lpngar sppkan,
th$t tha Symbpl by tha Ha$rth h$s ch$rrad on Effaced Skin...
Ah, Living with  No Longer Spoken!
Ch$rrad Phonemes: That Flash Has Left Me!

But then I know that if I get to Non-Existence first, I can beat it at its
own game and really do it in, I can stomp and squish Non-Existence, Heh!
already wet with the energy of it all, and then I'll return to speaking
and singing and murmuring and whispering and talking and saying and tell-
ing and even screaming and yelling and even speaking some more! Yes I
will! Yes I will! Even speaking some more!
