Where are the CUNEIFORM NEWSGROUPS, active as in days of yore:
Alt.hittite, alt.fan.hittite.sex, alt.hittite.slave, hierarchy
Hit.biz, hit.biz.slave, hit.biz.wood.forsale, hit.DINGIR, hit.KUR.KUR.MES
("Are there lands beyond Mitanni?"), 
AH, URU. DU.HI.A URU Hatti, ruined cities of Hatti! We are dismayed, lost,
The whole hierarchy gone, devolved: NO LONGER HITTITE PRESENCE ON THE NET!
SUMER again triumphant, we are sure, those pesky Babylonians seem to stay
Around forever!
In these days of increased multiculturalism, it behooves us, therefore,
To request, with due haste and proper admonition:
That you write the LUGAL of this KUR! That you insist upon Return,
To proper Glory, of these our lists, our home pages, our directories!
Of these our newsgroups, ftp sites, cuneiform welcome once again
Over LIMITED LOWER ASCII!
Note we do not ask for Hieroglyphic dominance, active as in days of yore,
{Note as well our ritual formula, ready for study and cultural thesis!)
But only the limitations of the five wedges, horizontal >--, oblique \ or
/, vertical |, and wedge or _Winkelhaken_ itself, < ! It is with 
Excitement that I write these characters, forsaken, enslaved by ASCII
Framework, the piling-on or coupling eliminated in this rigid format!
(To be sure, there are Akkadian PostScript fonts, but not all of us
Have access to such machinery as necessary - while almost every HITTITE
ALIVE TODAY, you will find possessing at the least an IBM 286...)
DO WRITE THE LUGAL! EVERY LU AND SAL nu- DUMU of you!
ISTAR! How much longer need we wait!
AH! LU, SAG. DU- _ZU I-NA- AK-_ They cut off his head!
Active, as in days of yore!
