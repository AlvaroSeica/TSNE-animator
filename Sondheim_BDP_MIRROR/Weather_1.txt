TwinWorlds


Beautiful Kyoto-MOO was reset with a core, MOO-1.8.0p3/, open to gates at
port 8888; alas, there were certain functions... such as the +enter editor
that would not work with confusion. As I have said. I opened a second MOO, 
with an older core: 

Beautiful Kyoto-MOO was reset with a core, MOO-1.7.9p2/, open to gates at
port 7777; and all functions, as before, worked beautifully. As I have
said, I exported the database, a.db over to Beautiful Kyoto-MOO #8, with
all its heartbreak and pathos. 

Uneasy doubles, these are twin-worlds, with the same pains, labor, and
anxiety, with different behaviors on a number of functions, but with the
same overall structures. They carry the same ghosts, the same scarred
functions and borrowings from other MOOs; they carry the same dead letters
and welcome messages. The logs are different, begin and increasingly di-
verge. The logs and what else happens, the history upon history, the
doubling or layering that creates cracks, splits, increasingly convoluted,
chaotic. 

Oh #8 is a lonely MOO, #7 gathering attention for the beauty of hir inter-
ior and smoothly flowing processes. It's as if... from this moment on...

I am already in a process of uncanny mourning - _uncanny,_ because of the
doubling and all the issues (genetic, mirror-stage, chiral, eternal-re-
turn, etc.), that twin-worlds imply. And a process of _mourning,_ because
of the loneliness of #8, faltering, slightly awkward with its additional
tracebacks and confusions, running alone, almost totally isolated, its
newly-granted history pristine and stillborn. 

There's no solution to any of this - I am distraught...
