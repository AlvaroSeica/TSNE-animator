Once upon a time, Harry rode out with Debbie into the forest. 
They were looking for trolls who wanted a good time, upon a time.
Four trolls were sitting on mushrooms and Debbie and Harry said,
"Hello, fine trolls, this is an even number of days we have." 
At this point, the forest grew very still, and Lou and Reed,
two of the trolls, said in union, "How very odd." The sky grew 
dark and the enormous loins of the mountain gave birth to crystal 
springs. The fir trees shook their trunks against the stars,
as if to say, hello, we are with you, even though no one else is.
But the gods heard no one, the gods were Hittite gods, speaking
Luwian, and Lou and Reed had nowhere to turn; it was the Mitanni
who raised their horses. Harry and Debbie were very still, and
disappeared from the story. The four trolls did too. Only the 
gods remain, giving birth, from time to time, to mortals who
forgive them.
