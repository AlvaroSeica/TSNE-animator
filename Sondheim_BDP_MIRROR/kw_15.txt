Confessive-Repulsive Disorder


Says Jennifer, which is exactly what I have - she should know, I'm wearing
her dirty panties... Ah well... These are notes from _all over._ Jennifer
can't stand the fact I'm writing all the time. I find it yummy. But it's a
disorder, disorderly - my life's a mess. I'm a piece of shit.

In those painting crits, I tell her, I'm always reminded of other people's
work - _this_ painting surrounded by flows and images which inundate it -
just like this editor, interrupted by incoming. I'm made entirely out of
such information - call it _composition,_ call it fresh-woman composition.
Call it fresh-man.

The sea of images and the sea of imaginaries. But this is crazy. Guilt at
being part of the war-machine, hopeless and decomposed - nothing stops it
but arbitrary actions by arbitrary old white men. Their white is the color
of death. Their cocks are violent and filled with poison. They shit on
themselves because they can't help it so they clean the rest of the world. 
The mouths of the rest of the world are filled with missiles. They starve
to death with metal shit. Don't forget how a bomb works: it expands.

They have no imaginary. They have to make everything real. They have to
make everything hard. They are hard workers. They fuck metal with metal.

I will push the dirty panties up into my hole. I will enjoy myself. I will
show you everything at a big party. You will see me and touch me and hear
me and smell me. I am yours forever.

Every five years in this big world of ours, there is nothing to write any-
more. Every thousand, there are no readers.
