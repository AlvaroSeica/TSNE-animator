Talking Life (Literally Fleshing Out)


1 Talking about the projection/introjection of emotion on the Net
  (whose emotion?)
  Emotion on the Net is always already embodied and equivalent to any 
  other embodiment. Every aspect of the Net is identically embodied.
  (Think of this as an identity politics, not an equivalence politics.)

1A Levels of embodiment: Syntactic / Semantic / Projective/Introjective
  (What constitutes talking/seeing the online body - what constitutes
  _being_ the online body. Every representation is a scan, raster, file.
  Every representation approaches the continuum; every representation is
  full of holes.)

1Ai Levels:
  a. Protocols, bits and bytes: grammars, scripts, programs, errors,
     core dumps, indexicalities
  The Bones
  b. Performatives, comprehensions, iconics 
  The Organs
  c. -Jectivities, embodiments, resonances, symbolics
  The Mind

2 Talking about 1/2/3/other person on chats etc.
  a. Space-orientations (ytalk, icq, powwow): I am here, you are there
  a1. Time-orientations (irc, chat): I follow you, you follow me 
  b. Dispersed space of the body - multi-MOOing, avatars (spacings)
     Lag (timing)

3 My own work with jennifer, julu, nikuko as system interrupts, resonances
  - _effusions_ - pushing towards psychosis - author and authority
  a. Moving into abjection, loss of body, body repair, experiential.
  b. Emanation, splay, dispersion, gain of body, prosthesis.

4 Considering the future of the Net as 'seamless virtual reality,' the
  interpenetrations and mixups on the Holodeck - Jennifer writing Alan,
  jennifer-function, body-function, quantum-logic superimpositions

5 I will be working from notes/outline, not a completed paper - the
  relation of the body to speech is integral for me - (What of the
  speaking body online, what of the online body?)
