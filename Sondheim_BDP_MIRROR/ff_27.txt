To Faith


To have found faith; to have founded faith; to have had faith foundered.
The withdrawal of faith is not faith; it is done to one. I would say that
this is a concrete act in remission. To have faith is to found faith; even
broken on absurdity, it is a founding. To found faith proceeds from having
found faith; the difference rocks heaven. To have had faith founder is to
lose the founding, lose the foundation.

To have found faith is faith's extension; faith becomes faith is every-
where. Faith everywhere is a founding and a foundation. To have faith
founder is to lose faith's foundation; faith breathes through loss and
pure appearance. 

One loses faith through pure pictures. Faith is never found; faith is a
having-found or a finding. Faith is a moment from faith-in to the purity
of faith. The _in_ is the proper name of the finding.
