Future


Twenty years into the future, these lists will most likely be discontinued
and forgotten; email will have given way to multimedia, and most partici-
pants will be elsewhere in the midst of global chaos. Consider enclaves of
users, protected computers / encryption groups, information warfare which
will really be entertainment warfare, the complex real reduced to nanotech
sloganeering. Discussion will proceed as deadly as now, as repetitive; no
one on-line will comprehend the binding of elsewhere-peoples.

These are moments of rhizomatic condensation, lines-of-flight sutured into
Borromean knots, impermanent subjectivities woven out of clotted postings.
Just as psychoanalytics or trigonometry have no advancement, so philosophy
dies always already unencumbered, which is its definition - philosophy as
the study of inconsequentiality, art its domain.

Twenty years into the future, our faces will be blasted off at the roots;
alterity will be a condensation, the other already an over-determination.

What dies, stops dying.
