Being, from Yours


It's always a mode of brambles and thistles
across the highways down near the stream bends
where mending the gorse from one to the other
side against side and moss against moss
you might find one who leaves, you might find a new one
you might find an older, you might find the eldest
there it would be, the bark on the knolls
of the knots or the knobs of the trees and their roots
always searching for origin, the race lost among us
always looking for roots, look ye no further
one mends from the gorse against the dark stream
from brambles and thistles, one makes the dark jerkin
from gorse comes the shoes, from gorse comes the jacket
ice forms on the rocks, the trees hide the origin
the race lost among us, the roots of all Being
look for jacket by stream-side, gorse in the down-stream
Being you'll find there, the Being of Being
