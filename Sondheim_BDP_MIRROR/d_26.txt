"I want to write this book in order to explain what feeling is."

(Nijinsky, Diary)







Nudity, which conjures up the most beautiful vistas, appears upon the

slightest motion of the lids, curtailing the din of the everyday, a

crimson curtain shutting down the world, ah.



Pubescent moisture at the edge of the mouth just beneath the bright

sparkling eyes, lips garnished with vermillion slashed into lovely

smear blending into the subtle plateau shadowed by fluttered

cheekbones, ah.



Dark ridge into the forest of black hair harbored near the glossied

lineaments of ear and crevice, damp with oils seduced from animals

aligned with edits, teeth, and glistened tongue, ah.



Running down the hand the deer, fawned elbow, hooved palm, lines 

read through enormous chasm, ah.



The chasm: I see written on the body, you have a short life conjuring

appearance, curtailed and shut down by disasters oh so not so far

away. And I see written in the air, a pubescent relationship with a

lovely and subtle woman shadowed by life's bleak end. And further, I

see into the darkness harbored by the lineaments of desire, damp with

true love blending the life glistening with happiness, oh to be so

seduced with the pleasure of being, thy poor life cut short, oh. And

at last, I see life running out, fawning to the very end, where the

lines meet, become enormous, ah, I have erred, they become enormous,

never ending, life eternal, ah.
