exhaustion: to cut away the interior of the body
 to eliminate differentiation of parts
 to return parts to dysfunctionality and substance
 to prepare substance for the irretrievability of the real
 to create the violence of nourishment for others
 to blanket others with the loss of proper names
 to incise the interior walls of the body with illegibility
 to insist on nothing and everything against difference
 to create dull and mutilated violence against oneself
 to shatter the sky within the memory of the other
 to fear and to have the great fear
 to crudely inhabit gristle as one might murder an other
 to cross out sight or sound of populated worlds
 to suffocate on words within the slight compunction
 to desperately wish for death forgetting desperation
 to wake with the sleep of the hopeless
 to sleep with eyes wide shut against the stitching of the self
 to suture the limbs on and off upon the uselessness of torso
 to be spoken for with unutterable violence
 to be eloquent against the margins of the scream
 to be present at aborted births and deaths of substance
 to uncomprehend the muck of repetition
 to crawl and shatter by virtue of the world's compulsiveness
 to brokenly obsess
 to utterly disinvest
