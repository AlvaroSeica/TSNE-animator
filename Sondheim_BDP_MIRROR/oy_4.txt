The gods.


You have heard the tales of white birds, wings from dawn to dusk.
They fill the sky with translucence, muffle the shape of clouds.
Their cries gave someone the idea of language and mourning.
The utterance of the first word, 'inconceivable.'

The bittern knows the gods.

Tonight the gods will descend upon the earth.
They will sink into the earth, but only so much into the earth.
Sinking as if the soil were damp or marsh, unable to cope.
Unable to cope with so much deity, nonetheless resistant.
All gods are jagged gods and all gods are desperate.
All gods are the shifters in language of the second person.
Gods create the third person from the second person.
And beyond the third, a fourth, and beyond a fourth, the fifth.
Once the gods are created they are released.
That is one of the definitions of the gods. 
The gods descend like rain into meadows and wild fields.
Fields lain fallow or fields of unspoken appearance beneath glacier and 
stream.
Planted, their root systems are shallow, winds will trample them.
Storms will weigh them down with the pleasure and fecundity of water. 
It is the incoherency of the gods that is their definitions.
What is released is incoherent, what is coherent is framed, what lies 
between them is aliased.
The aliasing of the gods is the jagged of the gods and the names of the 
gods, who abjure names.
The punishment of naming names, the punishment of names.
Like sea oats like ocotillo like willows like quaking aspen, 
slight movements of the gods shimmer the murmurs of the worlds.
Gods are worlds, are incoherent worlds, every definition a definition 
of the gods.
They come in winter. They reside.
Tonight the gods descend upon the earth.
They descend into the soft earth, they sink into the soft earth.
They are invisible to us, we are invisible to them.
The slightest impressions as they bend, move silently, the slightest 
sounds, their murmuring.
All gods are smoothed, all gods are filled with the quietude of rustlings, 
unfathomable beauty, mist at dawn, the vertical.

Heidegger's Hut

poised among the fourfold, the lure of new man, new development, and 
yet... closer to fourfold, among uncounted elements, unaccounted-for. for 
often I have approached this live or in dream to little avail; I would 
wait for clearing weather, for the world to happen, for technology to 
disappear at the base. Heidegger remains there above his troubled 
politics, of which there is no counting-four; we are close to hearth, we 
are embers among the dying worlds. Soon the snows will melt, glaciers 
disappear; the hut stays on a lure, overlooking resettled life, spaces a 
thousand kilometers long, an empyrean high. I cannot imagine a world such 
as this, life in hut corner, close to warmth, old wooden bench and bed, 
columnar spirit emerging to heavens' other worlds. We live in imaginary 
solace, his hut our own, released to the elements and beyond, transformed. 
There is no journey in the journey, no dream in the dream. One has life 
only for so much sorrow. Glow remains the last of our eyes. Hearth warms, 
beyond.

Rilke's Death from development, of angels, welkin reminders, of what might 
have been, here, among other valleys' roots, like magma, poured spirit one 
and then another; furious angels! invisible, whose arms illuminate the 
night harrowed from animals wounded, animals dying; among all orders, a 
command. With what might one counter the thin edge of the Real?; with what 
countenance?; with what countenance will Any listen? Multiples move, among 
multitudes; crossed by elk, by deer, by wolves, kestrel-binding holding 
fields (these wait for No One)

What hovers, soars (these move for No One)

aliasing i ii i

what happens when the real is aliased, when the shifted world shifts 
shifters against its shifty self. yes for the punning, but the bones are 
there beneath the surface. what occurs within the digital never stays 
within the digital; what occurs within the analog stays within the analog.
this is silent film.

when continuum devolves into segments, aliasing ii: the world stutters and 
re-stutters; nothing is visibile; eyes squint to make sense of it all. 
what happens in the analog stays in the analog; good luck with seeing the 
real.

Ship and Bell


"We therefore infer that the _effects of different permanent disturbing 
forces acting under similar conditions on the same coordinate are not 
simply proportional to their respective magnitudes but depend on their 
periods."

"We therefore infer that _a disturbing force whose period and real expo- 
nential are nearly the same as those of any one free vibration produces a 
large forced vibration._"

"We conclude that _one effect of the resistances on a disturbing permanent 
force, which would otherwise produce a magnified forced oscillation, is to 
modify that oscillation and to keep it within bounds._"

"In the same way _heavy church bells_ can _be easily set in motion_ pro- 
vided the pulls are properly timed. To increase the oscillation each rope 
should be pulled only when it is descending. A large heavy ship can be 
made to roll, when its natural time of oscillation is required, by running 
a gang of men to and fro across the deck at the proper time; the men run 
uphill."

(from Advanced Dynamics of a System of Rigid Bodies, Edward John Routh)

But if the men run uphill, surely the oscillation will ultimately be 
damped since their effect in total would be to reduce the roll? Or does 
the natural time depend on the minimization of the roll? Suppose on the 
other hand the men run to and fro at the proper time - running downhill. 
Then the oscillations will possibly increase as energy is added on the 
downswing. With the descent of the bell, a pull raises it further, 
increasing the potential energy. With the rolling of the ship, potential 
energy is increased as the men running downward add to the slope. However 
if upon running downward, the ship is rising, then the damping effect 
might slow the rising of the ship, just as, if running upward, the ship is 
sinking (sloping downward), the running will become first flat, then down- 
ward, carrying the energy downward and pulling the roll. If the roll is 
pushed, the roll is damped, if the men are running upward; if the roll is 
pulled, the roll increases, if the men are running downward. The men run 
first upward, then level, then downward, or first downward, then level, 
then upward. Perhaps damping in the second case, increasing in the second. 
Suppose the men _always_ run upward, then as the ship levels, the men stop 
running; as it continues downward, the men turn around and run upward; the 
damping is doubled. Suppose the men _always_ run downward, then as the 
ship levels, the men stop running; as it continues upward, the men turn 
around and run downward, the increase is doubled. By "doubled" one means 
the force is applied twice on the swing, depending on the tilt of the 
ship. In both cases, of the bell and the ship, gravity is paramount; one 
runs or pulls against it, or one runs towards it, in which case pull is 
impossible; however, a second cord might in fact pull the bell in an 
opposite direction, just as the men might jostle from one side of the ship 
to the other. Is this resonance, or the orders given to men, the acts of 
men? The men follow the pull and push of the bell, slope of the deck of 
the ship; there is no natural swing or pull here, only culture, commands, 
actions in unison. The ship stops rolling or rolls over; the bell stops 
ringing or turns full on its pivot. In any case, the dynamics are both 
evident and peculiar; the men must experiment, over and over again, to 
find the proper resonance, response. It is a difficult problem, settled 
only in church, on the high seas, even though the dynamics are evident.




(From http://www.asondheim.org/biog.txt -)


2007 almost: This memo, memorial, memory, memory-graph, meme, remembrance, 
autobiography, reminiscence, mnemonic, skitters back-and-forth; it remains 
undone; there's nothing of _thought_ in it; what remains are events; 
they're already dissolving; I can't "believe" events.

2007 This is the year beginning in cold rain. I think about the biog.txt 
to date - not only skittering, but awkwardly written - an occasional turn 
of phrase as if it makes any difference. There are no New Years resol- 
utions - just to continue with music / video / texts etc. Everything (when 
I think of it) appears scattered; the biog.txt represents so little of the 
world I've inhabited, or dreamed of inhabiting. It's an attempt to corral 
the scattering of my material culture, memories, after my death. When you 
read this, think that behind every word was a Proust, behind every Proust, 
yet another. And how worlds shatter, imminent, with death! - What has been 
ordered, treasured, conceived - what has been familiar, loving, cherished 
as the pages of a book are cherished - becomes the debris of others - 
everything is torn asunder, wounded, just as the world falls apart, less 
and less rebuilt elsewhere. Think of these sections, then, as the last 
remnant of coherency - what remains of an infinite richness of thought. 
Worlds devolve words devolve, hold fast, at least momentarily, past the 
living body, sunk into living language. Everything else, except perhaps 
for Azure, for Joanna, leaves and forgets the shattering which releases, 
not light, but order returned to substance. There is more to me than there 
is to the sun, to any star; there is less and less upon inclement return. 
And today, yesterday on the cusp, the announcement of the 3kth soldier to 
die in Iraq, all worlds, words, crashing to the ground, revised in the 
false resurrection of the war memorial. The rain falls against orders, 
against commands; we're lost, against all odds.
