Issues:

There is no Net
Semiotics:
 Off-Net beginning with perception
 On-Net beginning with the signifier
    Net relationships tending towards perception (in-signia)
Virtual embodiment, virtual subjectivity:
        An issue of ontology: Qualitative difference in being
        An issue of epistemology: Different phonemenological horizons
Virtual:
        Completely constituted
        Wryting oneself in and out of existence
                The performed body, body as instantiation
        The (textual) lurker
        The (visible) lurker: slight change of body planes
   Historic:
     From synchronic/asynchronic
     To declarative/performative
     To the seamless virtual
       Safe words
       Rough spots
Interpenetrations:
        Subjectivity as dispersion, dis/play, splay
        Interpenetrations (does it make sense to ask the location
                of the mind)
        Segmentation, liminal states
                Rites of passage (logging on and off)
                Smooth or clear passage (Usenet, Worldschat)
                Rite (email list, ThePalace)
          Addictions, defuge
          Continuous governance, continuous presence
            Guaranteed presence in the 'real world'
            Eternal presence in the 'online world'
               Digital reproducibilty and eternity
Net sexuality:
        ASCII unconscious, projections and introjections
        Operation of lag (intended and non-intended)
          Lag as breathing, rhythm, hypnotic
          Lag as structuring transfererence
        Control
          With or without lag
        Time on the Net parallel to space in the real
        Operation of seduction
        Articulations:
                First person (ytalk, Iphone, CuSeeMe)
                Second person (MOO, talker, MUD)
                Third person (IRC, chat)
           Place and time of the body:
            The ytalk place
            The MOO @dig home
              Scrolling on MOO, MUD, IRC
              Representations of the interior of the body
              Representations of the states of the body (MUD)
Jennifer-Julu, pushing the boundaries:
        Semantic part-objects interpenetrating applications, protocols
                Broken conceptualisms
                        The structure of applications, protocols
                        Arbitrary Jennifer-Julu structures
                    Confluence of both beneath the a/sign of desire
        Jennifer-Julu as system resonances
        Jennifer-Julu as splayed structures across apps, protocols
        Emergences, submergences
The _tracing_ of the Net in terms of articulated fluxes:
        CB radio (eyeballing)
        Language dispersion theories (Sumerian, Akkadian, Hittite)
        Constructions of consumption
        Desiring machines
Hysteria and the Net:
        Reading and writing _on_ the virtual-real body
        Continuous enfolding, engendering
        Continuous repetition
Membrane and Net, implicate ordering
>From disorders of the real to dis-ordering the real
Wild Theory
        There is no theory
        But wild theory
