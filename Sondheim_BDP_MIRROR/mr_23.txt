humans

wearied weather
tethered trappings
rappings raging
gauging gleaming
harming humans
men and women
bend with barrow
marrow's mourning
churning craters
slaughters smashing
bashing buildings
ailing angels
spangled swerving
curving carnage
scarred and stalking
harking hating
deigning dying
crying counted
haunted hooded
bloody booting
shooting dark-shorn
born with boneyards
seared and screaming
beaming blinded
rited rhyming
deeming deathbells
wells are waiting
baiting banging
hanging humans
doomed and diving
thriving tearful
wearied weather
