(S)MER


Everything conspires to drag us into the past, where causation appears 
perfect, even if Babylonia and the Upanishads require emergence. Cause 
and effect is neat, takes care of death as well; what was, lives on; 
there's always the question of inheritance. We have names for this, so 
many names in fact, that it's the situation of an entire industry...

Think of: memoir, paeon, obituary, recounting, memory, ode, recreation, 
accounting, remembrance, funeral, funereal, retelling, memorandum, 
biography, autobiography, epitaph, cenotaph, history, retelling, grave, 
genealogy, archeology, memorial, prehistory, commemoration, requiem - 
and there are more, innumerable others, in varying forms, some with the 
_re_ going over the same ground, a visitation and so forth (ghosts, 
wraiths, spirits of children killed in the plague); and some with the 
_mem_ or the retelling of it all, alas...

We can't escape this, our own stories, already entombing us, pulling us
back into the past, reconstructing the _problem_ of time as the dream
screen against which we locate our own desires, projections, introjections
in the form of violated beauty and horror.

It's those strands of algae in Brecht's Manual of Piety again, it's the
death of Ophelia, everything pulling us deeper, there's no end to it. The
cast of forlorn times is always upon us; we try to make use of history,
even make sense of it, forgetting that the only sense is that of sense-
lessness, that cause and effect are not there for us, are only the desire
of intellect gone awry. The tombs, graves, markers, shafts, stelae, do
nothing but ascertain cause, construct the world from chaos, over and over
again. And what is a masterpiece, (yes, gender-laden), say, if not already
the signifier of demarcation: this is a _moment_ of comprehension, which
usually mind you means _the most overdetermined moment_ - thus Rembrandt
or Leonardo - you can read the world into them. In fact the only "truth"
of Leonardo was his last sequence of global catastrophic drawings, every-
thing occurring without rhyme or reason.

_Memory_ and related apparently from a stem (S)MER-1, related to _mourn_ 
in Claireborne, The Roots of English: We remember the death of the other. 
We turn away: shame. We live _to remember._

Age pulls us down; just as death seems causeless and is recuperated
through the suturing of mourning, entombment, so the origin is causeless
as well, coupled with emergence, mythos, beginnings which apparently cir-
culated around themselves. We're thrown between the two, thrown _in the
midst of happenstance,_ constructing the Aristotelian as we go, the logic
of causes, of vacuum, annihilation, and lack - of fullness, creation, and
plenitude, inputs and outputs. It's all there, myths varying from one to
another position; a compendium of the first quatrain of all the creation
texts worldwide would tend towards exhaustion, language splayed apart,
deconstructed. Never fear; _man_ is _resolute._ Never fear; there are
_containers_ for the _thing contained._ Never fear: Tiamat gets angry; 
the guys try to deal with it, Babylonia. Never argue with male god/heads
taken apart by their own irreconcilable logic. 

I have no order in which _I speak this._ I sense my own pull towards the 
grave. I sense the flash of memory and mourning burning skull-dry, in- 
creasing their loads. I hear them, hear you. I make them, make you. I put 
you together, put them together. I take you apart, take them apart. I 
remember, at last, these words sewn as the threads silence my lips, etc.: 
There is no cause for cause. The platitude rings true, doesn't ring. 

So there are two questions: why is there something rather than nothing?; 
how does this nothing begin causation? Infinite time places the origin
elsewhere; this form of logic, applied to the cosmos is presumption it-
self; one cannot legislate. What then? I prefer the pure grief of random
acts to the fictions of narrative. This too is a leap, but at least out of
the cycle, not of rebirth, but of implication: the _archeology_ of mourn-
ing, the travails and history of the therapeutic, the narration of the
sepulchre. And how could _causation begin,_ if not through the grace of 
the story-teller's art?
