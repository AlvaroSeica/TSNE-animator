This beautiful clumsy session!


Root told a story, don't get it started, it was a public story, very pub-
lic, it started about a stripper and a model named Jenn, it was Jenn's
story, a story told by Root, story after story. Root dialed Jenn, it was a
project about the stripper alone in a bin. Stripper found Root, a warm
nighttime sky, doc, cirrus clouds overhead, don't get me started. Root
nourished from a log, do you read me? Just like that. Somebody's always
getting started after something. The whole world's got to have an answer.
