What the Engine Does, of the Anorectic Airliner





The Engine swallows the air; it is the point at which the movement of air

and its dispersion begins. This is an act of devouring, gorging, the buli-

mic cycle which collapses as the world is absorbed. It is a transformation

into substance as the Engine appropriates the foundations of the signifier

for itself. What an appropriation! The Engine inscribes the absorbed world

in an exhaust trail. The Engine parallels the photon; it refuses position

as the tokenization of existence; it exists as movement and collapse. Thus

it flies and desires the air. Thus it appropriates and seduces the air,

through an act of violence which retains its position of flight. For that

which would escape it, Engine, cruise missile, bomb, what is being said

but the "I" of the engine, within a dialectic of seduction? Seduction in

which the Origin is proclaimed, and that is the metric established as

Origin, the location of the phallus. The cruise missile cocks its head,

gives it to the world. It is semen which is disorganized; the world burns

into paste through an atmosphere of paste, through an Engine of paste. The

world burns, the Engine burns, swells, disgorges; it is the world returned

to vomit. The anorectic airliner shudders (therefore shudders);  the line

of flight is re-established. Such an establishment with markings in the

sky! Such a sky that establishes itself as a graph with mobile coordin-

ates, exhaust that indicates while it dissipates, is absorbed in the

clutter of the air. The tiny Engine! The presence of Flight! The erection

in the sky and the charred earth! It is the appearance of the microtech-

nological once again, the bacteriophage with its consonant and identical

units. It is an empty circle. It is the exhaustion of repetitive expan-

sion.
