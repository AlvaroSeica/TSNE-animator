Hi Sandy,

Odd working on this and re: my mother; my father's in the hospital at the 
moment and my brother and I have been talking about his death, although he 
may well live for several more years... It's a harrowing time.

I like the exchange below; I'd like to continue it a bit, if it's 
possible, and in any case prepare it for putting up online, possibly on 
the Eyebeam blog which would be really good; apparently I'll have one off 
the main blog, etc. Please let me know what you think.

I'm twisted re: my father, as you can well imagine, not in all that great 
shape... (Alan)
