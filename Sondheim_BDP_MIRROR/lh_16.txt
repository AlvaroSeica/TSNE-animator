Parable


This is a story that has been told many times, but is well worth the re-
telling. One day Izanagi and Nikuko, for it is true that they traveled
together, were passing by a ridge in the vicinity of Dazaifu. The way was
steep, and suddenly, a white fox bounded across the path in front of them,
disappearing into the bamboo forest. Izanagi said, This must be an omen;
let us keep our eyes open for further adventures. Nikuko remained silent
and thoughtful as they continued on their way. All at once, the forest
grew darker, the birds stopped their singing, and the strips of sunlight
disappeared from the tall stems. Another omen, Izanagi said, and Nikuko
remained silent. A little further on, they came to a stone peculiarly
carved in the shape of a tortoise (Why, at this height, said Izanagi), and
beyond that, they saw a small stream reverse its course, wending its way
uphill. Izanagi spoke again, asking Nikuko, All these omens, what do they
signify. Nikuko replied, These omens announce one another, like the cycle
of births and rebirths; they signify nothing but each other, the eternal
wheeling of worlds. They continued along the path, passing two unicorns
fighting, a woman playing a ch'in in a most mournful manner, golden birds,
and dragons coursing through the air, as they made their way to the
summit.
