or heading towards new-form

or the participation of the player

or the dancer entombed

or the surgical removal of the jumping legs

or the permanency of movement quelled

or proceed at your own pace

or the microtome of vestigial movement

or the moment of the pirouette



it is the dance heading towards the archive, the archive shuddered by the

dance, curtailment, that our work tends towards - Foofwa d'Imobilite, Azu

re Carter, Alan Sondheim - this flicking among flics among flicks - an _o

"this work exists on the boundary between archive and dance, their

intersection," said Nikuko, "where the land is parceled in primordial

ritual reconstituting the re/creation of each and every object, thing,

and organism." "this work is the encoding of a biological feat."



1 BAR.AN-donkey, 1 garden, and 1 house in Akkad, it's Lugalumuk's.

well, it's some sort of donkey. with a quiet heart, a quiet house, 

with a quiet garden, with a quiet silver, with quiet gold, quiet

azurite, with quiet wood, with the silence of animals, with the

dance of animals



"I will archive your dance, archive the words of your love; I will hold

you to the polished grain, I will hold you to the quiet garden" (what we

have said in the garden).



it is difficult to read this, to dance this, seized by iremu casting their

spell, seized by ecstasy, seized by closure in the archive: "Then she ex-

plodes. Her arms fall off, her head rolls to the ground, smoke pours from

her body. She was a doll, an automaton. There has been all this machinery

surrounding prima donnas, and now--this performance where the prima donna

herself becomes a machine. The prima donna is a phantom presence, whose b

ody is expressed only by voice, whose existence is created only by voice:

the new Eve, she is the place of illusion." (Catherine Clement, Opera, or

the Undoing of Women.)
