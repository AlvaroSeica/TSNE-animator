	You drench me across steppe and wolf,

		Fallowed birches hallowed while I

			Thighs like Pillars of Maldoror

		Caress Peninsular Eddies



	I am a MAN a cloud in trousers

		virga poured forth through every foreign pore

	  closed to all takes, ah... I come to you

			Maldoror wrapped around the wounded heal

		Baldur sinking in the sea !



	Cumulonimbus and shear zone

		Hail fluttering around your cunt I



	Inhale a shear zone I saturated accumulated / Eisenstein !

			graupel soft hail tongued by Lulu tongued

		by Berg tongued by Wedekind \ Lili-Maria

	mon ange MOSCOW wheel-spoken four cart thrust



			down-stairs childhood's absence

		Meyerhold walked !



	I trampled lay down attic ! infested sewers of Paris I lay

		broad with Lili-Maria thrust flag wet with

			Blood of Baldur ankles against the sea



	Odin I pull runes for you, crucify myself

		forgone tailors suited

			lightning crashes from my cock hands throat !



	fire spews from my cannon's roar

		cart-rolled of capital formation I call

	LILI-MARIA mon ange call car-told of silver gold coffers

			open in the streets !



	Virga pours from me dies towards earth !

		Virga pours from me dies towards mother earth

			VIRGA POURS from me dies I call opened



	in Vein, ( ah, you think this poem is about you ! )

			MOSCOW's arteries gather carts gather

		eddies of wind and whirling

			gather umbrellas and sewing-machines flown

		on aeroplane gather

			work-men and -women Decembrists barricading



	LILI-MARIA mon ange violent with love

		and Revolution joined with fierce resolve you shear

	resolve, stare, start



		That Cloud !

	

				That Cloud in Trousers



			Rain will never come !
