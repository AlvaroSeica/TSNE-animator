i did not know susan graham
i had never heard of susan graham
 susan graham, you are unknown to me; I have created your name, I have
 made it all up out of whole cloth, you did not have to do this to me, i
 knew nothing of opera, of your career,

    , susan graham , susan graham

      i did mean you no harm, i would not have written to you or found
      you, i know nothing of opera, in fact i don't even like it, i've had
      no reason to know - what are you, soprano, coloratura, sopranino, i
      don't know what would fit you well or likely, it was something
      fabricated, i know the coincidences seem all too real, but only to
      you, there are too many of you


she lives on down that road, i can picture it now with the swinging
traffic light in the hot dry nighttime wind, i can see it, i know
it, it's right before me, i understand it all too well

  i didn't mean you no harm,
  , susan graham, i thought
  it was all a joke, i thought
  there wasn't any other susan graham, there was just the one i made up
  out of whole cloth honest, it was for a lot of writing i was doing, i
  was thinking,

    , susan graham you would be nice to see watching things out of that
    window across from that hot dusty dry road at night when you could see
    the cars at the end of the street and sometimes hear the guns go off
    , susan graham it was like that

    , susan graham
