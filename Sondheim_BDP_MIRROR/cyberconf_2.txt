"
Dria says, "you just have to understand what it is that you're 
getting into..."
Dria says, "but it is possible to get so much more from 
it...real love, can gro w out here."
Martin says, "Jerry's talking ..."
Raxcip says, "yes, of course. "
Dria says, "you sound unconvinced. :)"
Raxcip says, "My friend was a world away."
Dria nods
Dria says, "aye...I know what it's like."
Alan says, "One of the speakers is talking about how he enjoyed 
watching the th e screen and Alan and the timekeeping.  This, I 
(Richard) think is an example o f how net.sex affords a greater 
opportunity for voyeurism."
Dria grins
Martin grins
Raxcip says, "I find it hard to exist both here on teh net and 
in RL, and wholy give oneself in either space.  I choose the 
Real."
Dria says, "I toggle between.  I am not real."
Alan says, "I choose both.  The unreal has been very good to 
me."
zone laughs
Martin says, "I really like Ari's presentation ..."
Apocryphal says, "it seems..."
Raxcip fails to delineate.
Alan says, "JM is asking about the ethical challenges posed by 
net.se x."
Apocryphal says, "like there's no one-or-the-other each infects 
the other"
Martin says, "The text was most lost on me ... but watching the 
images of the h ands was definitely affaected by the MOOD of the 
text ..."
Alan says, "Don't forget that the Cathoholic Church has decreed 
that net.sex is a sin."
Dria says, "I walk out into the world 'rl' and I 
feel...unreal...it is surreal. ..it all feels surreal.  I have 
realized that "I" am not real (to anyone else, at least).  So 
why fight it."
zone exclaims, "!!!"
zone says, "That is astonishing."
Dria says, "you're not serious.  You *can't* be serious."
Alan is serious
Dria boggles
Speaker says, "Ari says even email is theatrical .."
Apocryphal says, "the screen as contraceptive"
Alan says, "Dria, I think in the long-run, this is a great 
development.  With a simple decree, the Church has given 
credence to cyberlife.  That's a good thin g."
Raxcip says, "the catholic church would never approve of fun 
without consequenc e."
Dria says, "well, yeah, but.  It's still stupid. :>"
zone nods.  Yes.  Calling netsex a sin has in one fell swoop 
brought it to the attention of the world...
Alan says, "Yeah, but I'll take a little near-sightedness with a 
lot of vision- -even if the vision comes inadvertently."
Dria decides to ponder it for a bit before forming a real 
opinon.
Martin asks, "Any questions to ALan?"
Martin says, "No"
Martin says, "That's it ..."
Martin says, "next sesion in 5 minutes .."
Alan says, "That's it, and thank you. There's another panel in 
five minutes and I can possibly work this through as well - not 
sure what the situation will be ..."
