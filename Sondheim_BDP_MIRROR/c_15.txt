Let me Be for You, Let you Post on Me





Listening to Hole thinking _I slashed mine_ legs spread wide apart 

red and blue scarves rippling from the bedposts, 

I can't move _suck it up baby_ as body turns stain and I can't complain 

sheet of color page you inscribe yourself 

_I been here_ you write _I got here_ you write

There's no address you can take with you walk across the street 

get a bite to eat. There's no protocol make you listen hard to Hole 

_help me I'm withering_

Listening to Bikini Kill thinking _punk rockers ask for it_ 

on my stomach holding death away this very night slides into day,

way away from the skin of it, body torn from the war of it 

I call your name you're not around I call your name there's not a sound

_This is not a test_ you got me at my very best, 

_when you get right down to the heart of the matter_ 

you gotta right me, sight me, you gotta take me, 

set me up, make me up, 

take me in your arms, giving you a hint

take me in your arms, make me in your print

Listening to the Breeders thinking _summer is ready when you are,_ 

Tibetan ghost scarves fluttering around my ankles, 

musk filling the air, ribbons in my hair, 

Tiffany I need you don't need you need you don't need you

Let me read for you, let me be for you

Like I always do, like I always do
