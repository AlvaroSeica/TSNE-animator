Why I love Amy Fisher


"Little dabs of blood were everywhere. On my white Formica chair. My
phone. My carpet. My desk. I called Jane again. Her father answered and
said she'd left. I took deep breaths and hoped like hell _my_ father
wouldn't wake up before she got there and helped me get rid of the blood.
For playing with guns, I thought I would definitely be punished by my
parents.

"It never occurred to me to worry about the police."

(From Amy Fisher, My Story, by Amy Fisher with Sheila Weller.)


"A female informant described the Virgin to Nash as follows: 'Senora, I
am going to tell you of the Virgin of the mineshaft. She is on top of the
metal, on top of the gold that is still there in the mineshaft, under the
church and the _pulperia._ Boiling water passes over this metal, crystal-
line water that is bubbling and boiling. The Virgin is miraculous. The
metal is liquid. It comes in very clean, and you can't move it at all. We
went into the shaft under the _pulperia_ once...How beautiful it [the
metal] was! It was like raw sugar.'"

(From Michael Taussig, The Devil and Commodity Fetishism in South Ameri-
ca.) 


"Someone else put it this way: 'Amy, you have all the subtlety of a Mack
truck.'

"Yeah: a Mack truck loaded with lit dynamite, with broken brakes, going
120 miles an hour toward a brick wall."

(Fisher.)


(The screen burns and shatters; my chest is cut. I can't see "what I'm
doing" - can't see my words; I'm silenced, remembering the proper key /
strokes to send the message _out._)
