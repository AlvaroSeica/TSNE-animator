disordering everything, even the most basic sight or site jubilation is in 
trumpets, in a manuscript as dated as the fourtheenth centure in spain who 
went out with last month's milk carton? i didn't know it dated - or maybe 
didn't go out, actually just remained, simmering and turning cool in the 
L-Shaped Room, wrong that seemed to put an end to the dialog, illy 
Strayhorn notwithstanding ------- i wince whenever i see that i've used 
the word "detritus" or "ephemeral" for the umpteenth time in a manuscript 
that's as dated aslast month's milk carton and then some Trumpets and 
clarions larinets and crumpets you know what's coming next, right? Kind 
hearts and coronets Stray horns and cornets, Ornettes "detritus" or 
"ephemeral" for the umpteenth time in a manuscript that's as dated aslast
