From the Horde -


Our name are Heraclitus, be careful, please don't bite us, Or all the
world will cease. We've hardly just begun, but we're already done, with
dark Parmenides. You might see us faking, the chains we'll be a-breaking,
with axiomatics making, a fool of all of these. Sometimes we'll get quite
hard, rereading Baudrillard, but that lasts just a minute, there's hardly
a thing in it, although he's quite a card. So look towards Irigaray,
that's what we've got to say, our ontology she knows, she's soaked with
all those flows, and that's the way it goes, or maybe not so hard, you
might ask Lyotard, and then where all the gaps were, you might begin to
stir, swooping and swaying with forks and knives, looping and flaying with
whips and lives, oh that slut, her! Judith Butler! Don't you know that
everywhere, you get tangled in pubic hair! We love the telly, radio; we're
up above, and down below, we've got no space and have no time, but we can
make a theory rhyme. We'll crawl up your leg when you howl and beg, crawl
down your arm when you chant a charm. We have no names, not monopoles, not
not even holes. We're not monads or churls, nomads or girls, hackers or
whirls. We're Her-a-clit-us, to be sure, we're running with fetish,
running allure! Catch us in you, there's no sin too! We could go on, but
it's your song, you've got bees in your hung lungs, stung!
