*It was pointed out repeatedly, on the voyeurism panel, that text has no
aura, no pointers, no other means of employment than itself - unlike
spoken language, one person in the presence of another. But in ytalk the
body is there, if only in the erasures, speed of writing, spelling mis-
takes, corrected or uncorrected. And on CuSeeMe, there are images, text
on the images, crude stuttered telephony, chat-line typing as well, peo-
ple staring, looking isolated; even _husbandnwife_ teams have one or
another protruding at the keyboard, the other remaining beyond/ behind. 
What's shared? But my fingers grope through their texts and pictures and
oh we'd love to see each other's w/holes.

**There's no language _of_ drawing, no language _for_ it.***

***No language for _es,_ no drawing of the _id._***
