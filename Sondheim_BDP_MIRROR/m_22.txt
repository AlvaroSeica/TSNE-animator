why we believe what we believe


language can't describe the messiness of ontology; language is delimited
from within and without. until this fact is realized, philosophy will
remain useless. ontological domains, to be sure, but interstitiality,
what falls between the gaps, what falls to the floor through the ground,
this remains elsewhere. a freshman thought! a true thought!

when i am happy writing to you, my theory goes as follows: that language
is a tethering, that there is an intimacy among the real. when i am sad,
when missing you dominates my horizon, missing a cipher or signal, mis-
sing a voice or a signifier, then language breaks off, becomes the wreck
of the real, the plate which cuts itself, cuts through itself and its
speakers. what is language if not the misery of transformation! a fresh-
man thought! a true and false thought!

but i speak to you as if the theory were true. but i speak to you, wait-
ing for the new theory which creates the world. but i speak to you of
worlds we have made together. but i speak @dig, as if: the variables have
been declared and accepted, we are hungered one together. a freshman
thought! a false thought!

but there is language everywhere, ceiling to floor. but the floor has 
been patched and painted (maybe there are signs on the floor). but the
ceiling no longer leaks when _it_ rains rain outside, when _it_ is... a
freshman thought! a freshman thinking thought!
