If a mark is made on the forehead of the female with tho paste made of gorochanl, root of lemon grass and saffron, then the husband becomes subdued. If a woman puts on a mark on her forehead with this substanco, and touches the organ of her husband with her left foot at the time of copulation, he ever remains subdued Ike a slave.

 us forever. For the performance I took the dissected cube (3-space measure polytope), dissected it into its 3, 2, 1, and
 0 components (also measure polytopes), separated them, copied them, rotated them at high speed, in summary creating a spiky and high-speed dangerous ground for movement and negotiation.
