Virtuoso Guitar

parlor guitar, circa 1890-1920, recently reset; it has remarkable 
resonance (may be a Larson Bros. student model). I've recorded with
it before, but now it sounds more beautiful than ever and doesn't
need the contact mic I worked with. Enjoy.

Also, sounds from radio blackout from the heat-wave, processed:

thump and punch

striking out in all directions he will punch the enemies of god
he will violate them and crush them utterly
they are useless fodder

waves warez and Juarez

http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/turnwav.mp3 Mathematica-
generated sound plus coda. this is over an hour long,
almost entirely minimal; the soundforms were created by
formula. around 2005.

http://alansondheim.org/juarez1.mp4 with Dawnja Burris,
shot in El Paso and Ciudad Juarez, this is a somewhat
edited segment. around 1992-3. it stills seems prescient.



Why not. Why not.

Why not. Because the background doesn't move.
Those things just stand there. The front twirls.
My usual in an old-fashioned way. Just watching the twirl.
It doesn't go anywhere. It has the consistency of paste.
It's slightly uncomfortable. It's not uncomfortable enough.
Never ever works out in this wide world. 
There are Julu Twine and Alan Dojoji mocking each other.
And in the foreground, this rubbery creature.
This creature that looks like it might stick to you.
Like it might do something untoward.
Just by its presence, just by its appearance or appearing.

Do check out http://www.alansondheim.org/juarez1.mp4 if you haven't;
it's worth it. Juarez may well be the most dangerous city on earth
now - you can see why in this 1993 short segment of Postmodern 
Sureno, which I'll post later, when and if I can convert from the 
dvd I found.



I used to be good.

I used to 'really have it' as they say. That was 'really something.'
I could turn out the magic without even thinking.
I was master of the image, master of the image programs.
I'd have an idea, just like that. And I'd make the idea _happen._
Here's an example: http://www.alansondheim.org/stranges.mp4 .
Here's another: http://www.alansondheim.org/stranges2.mp4 .
Brilliant! I couldn't possibly do these now!
I don't know what happened, but I have a theory: the Republicans.
It must have been the Republicans. It can't possibly be a coincidence.
The Republicans come in; my images go south as they say.
That's not an insult to the South. That's just an expression.
I'm sure that's just an expression. And I won't be side-tracked.
The Republicans would side-track me. Look at these images!
Look at the skills I had! I haven't made anything this good for years!
Not since the Republicans came in! I can't afford anything any more!
My mind's a shambles. My mind's ground to a halt.
It's the fault of the Republicans! I'm sure there's more to say about
this but I'm not sure what it is. I used to know what it is, but I 
don't know; my mind's blurry, I can hardly keep track of anything and
I don't have any ideas any more. I don't even know to to end this.
All I remember is that I used to be brilliant and I look at these
stunning images and say wow to myself and I know I can't do anything
this good now and the Republicans are running around my mind like
vermin. In fact I like vermin but I don't like Republicans! I used to
be so good!



e-very

I propose the word "e-very" for electronically-very, as in "This piece of 
email is e-very excellent, don't you think?". From here it will be a very 
short step to "every" which parallels "email" as in, "This definition 
which I'm sending you now is every astute, I do declare!". Please spread 
the word on this and it will every quickly go viral! Thank you, signed, 
The Every Luscious Jennifer

wounded avatar. aporia.


it's always someone else who writes this.
it's always someone else who is sick.
up until the limit, it's you, not myself, who is sick.
at the limit, i am gone, not even leaving a gift, leaving nothing.
at the limit, it is someone else who receives a gift.
the gift comes from nowhere. the gift is an object in the world.
the gift is a labeled object in the world. or an unknown object.
the avatar who is sick is a gift. the avatar who disappears is a gift.
the avatar leaves nothing behind. or the avatar leaves everything.
the avatar leaves everything but leaves everything to no one.
the pain of a wounded avatar is infinite. an avatar cannot speak.
an avatar is always spoken for and hir pain is stolen.

the wounded avatar is at the heart of the problematic of culture.
the wounded avatar is the heart of the problematic.
wounding is the erasure of the grounding of inscription.
the wounded avatar is the inscription of wounding
and the wounding of inscription:
it is within this field that materiality dissolves, 
meeting oncoming death face to face, in the sense of alterity.
the field blocks everything; the field does not exist.
the avatar says: it is over when i say it is over. 
the avatar is wounded.
