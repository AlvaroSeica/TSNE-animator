Rubbing Up Against You, Violette


Violette Leduc, Therese et Isabelle, Isabelle arrivait du pays des 
meteores, des bouleversements, des sinistres, des ravages, Isabelle 
was there from the land of meteors, of avalanches, of wrecks, of plunder, 
trans. Coltman, 1966/1967.

Alan Sondheim, lists, there is a certain consistency, there is a certain
style, there are no surprises, there is a general property of distinguish-
ability, I am immersed in the world, I possess a body, the body and myself
present a past to me; I assume this past has had some reality, I assume
this past has "had" no reality, there are others like myself, I am unique,
others likewise possess bodies, others likewise possess pasts, others are
imminent, there is a certain reality which is at least in part exterior to
myself, my outlines are blurred, there is an ambiguous threshold connected
to my body, there are objects within this reality, my body is an object,
my body is not an object, , when I am in love, the world is changed, 1971.

Violette Leduc, Therese et Isabelle, Vous etes ici, vous etes vraiment
ici, you are here, you are really here, trans. Sondheim.
