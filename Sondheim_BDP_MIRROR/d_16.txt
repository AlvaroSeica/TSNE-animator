Ascii Unconscious





speak to me speak me speak _your_



the unconscious is _written_ like a language... the other embedded in

it...  i suppose the object which forces the realization...objet petit a /

object petite a / what's the gender or cut, what's the inscription of the

gender / i'd write it's a schizzed listen hearing the he/she/they -



listen I'd write it any way I can, I'd write it on me, you'd write it on 

me - listen, you wrote _let me post on you_ - that did it, the outlines 

of my body already transparent gaining a kind of...weight... )



on both sides of the inscription - where suture comes in - because you've 

got to heal the inscription, seamless, the skin's seamless (fear of holes 

where _the body breaks into the real_ - Lyotard's flat puncturing) - what 

inscribes negates, a furrow -



because when i listen to myself i am listening to you - because i rise to 

the occasion of your language - long ascii swells - slight rise in sea- 

level, change in temperature - surface reflectance - invisible site - see 

you see me - mirrored site )



to the extent that the furrow is a proper name, to that extent it disasso-

ciates from difference, examines itself _there_ - but the body's schizzed 

in any case - that's _it_ - the occasion or occurrence - why the _your_ 

is devoured, dissolute - because it's simultaneously what you would have 

said what you wouldn't have said -



because you would have _me_ when the imaginary's more real than the real 

- because the unconscious seduces - you're always more real than i am )



the texts create me as a laminar manifold, strata and tendrils - plateaus

piled on plateaus - the conventional allowing of breathing and daemon -

you _book_ me - continuous rewrite - open up the space inside the body

where the language goes -



frisson and a thrill to be here thank you very much - ascii body always 

already shaved, luminous - you slide the _your_ into me - because you 

_said_ you would and it's not a matter of belief - it happens when you 

say it because it _has_ to happen - )



say it say it say it say it say it -
