Between one sarangi and another

one receding, one coming forward,
I like to think of them as protons
in the LHC, a bit of scattering


the distillation of pain in preparation for a conference

on good days
i dream of hitler youth and grey soviet masses
nameless american troops everywhere people marching
jagged assyrian warriors batak sacrifices
everyone known is deeply wrecking
salvage dams holding back debris
walking in collapsed buildings furious suicides
drownings, medicated deaths
police-tape barriers, artifice,s destruction
those names, ash, broken mouths, screams
everything going under
this crime won't be solved

why can't sleep
begin by thinking about being very old, a thing, continue 
where lump or pain becomes something else, body turns its course against 
me, that division. that night from which no awakening, remains 
unimaginable. break with the daughter of my family.

who were dear simply order psychically survive. leads post-traumatic 
stress syndrome, obdurate

circulation memories become permanent part psychic landscape: trip over. 
after death they're meaningless, just what saves us, jennifer asks, shall 
we survive, can turn, our future, you see when die, you, species, has 
history gone, happens dust, molecules, atoms, forms, records, data, 
speech, recordings preservation prions viruses, phages bacteria, 
parasites, sun planets lives, whom speaking, mind without service god, 
demons minds dissolve, corrode, decay, corrupt, longer hear your answers, 
ourselves, memory mother her book father his fire, these are gone sound 
mercury light switch luminous glow afternoon mighty trees moon there, 
murmurs planetary nebula, plasma disappears disappears, eyes it, ears 
among us oh keep their promises always based forfeitures, asks jennifer, 
be, turn me around, provide loving canopy soft nestlings presence friends 
all times places, hold within world living, nurture nourish feed clothe 
ah, am done for, says already half two-thirds three-quarters cries m 
conversation
