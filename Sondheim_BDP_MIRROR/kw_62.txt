Sakura Matsuri 


says the sign outside the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens where Simon and I
wander into the Japanese portion, only to face mono no aware, this sad-
ness and pathos of wabi and sabi at the torii from which hangs a single
bird at the edge defining the elder meaning; I had not realized in the
distance the presence of a shrine itself, abandoned, emptied internally -
none of the resident kami, but then in the midst of Crown Heights' edge -
what would I expect, none of the shintai; by now you recognize I do not
know any of this but the red-orange colour of the torii burns into the
trailings of Grand Army Plaza coupled with grey-green bronze patina rococo
shields, horses, and soldiers above the arch; I'm here in the tea house,
there are turtles and carp, the festival is even ever after the double-
blossoming cherry have lost their bloom this early-warning-warming year.
O, my heart! Filled with space! Matsu-cha is a harbor, I am a ship upon
the sea!

I am a liara! I don't know aesthetica! I don't know Japonica! I don't know
the ways of my hearta! I pretend to intelligenca! I pretend to Nikukoka!
I haven't a clueka! I can't thinka! I've been found outa! I've been found
outaka! O, my hearta! Filled with spaceka! Matsucha is a harborka, I am a
ship upon the seaka!
