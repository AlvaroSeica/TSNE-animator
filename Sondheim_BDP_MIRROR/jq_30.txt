Editorial on Generations

We like pets and ice-skating or tennis stars because their generations are
quick and we can mount ourselves over them like art stars whose reigns are
even less, watching through display-optical-devices aimed between our
feet. So generation after generation, our lives become longer; it becomes
us to take our culture quick, it doesn't matter what. I have seen ice-ska-
ters come and go. I remember music stars of yesteryear and look forward to
new music stars on the horizon, or music no one has thought of yet. There
may be riots in this city but five years from now, there may not be. Or
there may not be riots now but in five years enormous violence at the very
last moment. As Susan Sontag points out, we're mainly spectators to disas-
ter, but I'm talking about generations and how much you can learn in just
a few months or so. I go through years in a week and last week's computers
are a generation behind, just like network computers are already old hat.
So I say, we can't measure our ancestors: Jewish, I'm cut off, cauterized,
leery - but we can measure generations of sports and cultures, inhale and
dream them, upon the dull earth's surface of random inertia. This won't
last much longer, the universe points out, and in the time it takes to say
that, three more generations have passed.
