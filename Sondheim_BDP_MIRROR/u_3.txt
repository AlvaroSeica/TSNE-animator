The Loneliest Text


The loneliest text in the world announces itself, expects and garners no 
response, like so many others. It stands in for itself, for all those 
others of which there is no account, which have been lost in the archives 
or worst, abandoned entirely, invisible, violated without a murmur or 
other sub-text, other presence.

The loneliest text in the world expects nothing in return; read or unread,
nothing makes a differance, it leaves no trace, not even defuge announcing
its already tired presence.

The loneliest text in the world was lovingly brought into existence, each 
word caressed upon the birth of each word, only to be abandoned, control 
x, only to silently end up, packets, splattered nowhere across the wires, 
garnering no response, or in return, no other alter, no other presence.

The loneliest text carries its history, messages of beauty and import, 
messages of travesty and desperation, tragedy and dissolution; it lies 
fallow, outside of all time and space, losing itself in the memory of the 
writer who entered letter after letter, thinking each word, speech in 
return, weaving such a feeble presence.

The loneliest text is this text, lost in a world of noise and confusion, 
time and space filtered through dim membranes, cells coagulating around 
othered, emptied cells, forgetting for a moment, for eternity, for all 
time, forever and ever, the slightest vestige of its presence.
