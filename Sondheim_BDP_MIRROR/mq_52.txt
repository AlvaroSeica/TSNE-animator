i know a man


i see his face, it looms before me, i have sutured the throat, 
have returned the soul, he is our friend, he is so very good -

he will save many others, i will help him, i restore his eyes,
they are full of life, they love -

i restore his hearing, he will hear his plans have been dismissed,
his world is a world of peace, i release him from every prison -

i feed and nourish him, make him a comfortable place to live and sleep,
offer him the best of drink and food, he flourishes with my kindness -
i will be his servant, i will bring him back to life, i will help him -

just as he has helped others, his kindness knows no bounds, everything
about him speaks of good -

he has given us our lives and our humanity, he eliminates evil and 
corruption everywhere in the world, he speaks in the name of humility and 
perfection, i will restore his speech, heal him, i will sooth him,
make myself useful unto him -

this is a man, this is an unknown man who worketh miracles -
