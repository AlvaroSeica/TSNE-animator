Cipher



I am in love with someone for whom I will be an empty cipher. Ciphers

develop like cancers on the biographies of men and women everywhere. 

Loops are formed holding taut against the neck or constriction of events

which slip through. In the mid-nineteenth century a child was born to a

woman outside of Scranton Pennsylvania. The foreclosure of love upon the

body is terrifying. There is no inheritence. Writing is out of control. 

Stars form pinwheels in the snow beneath our feet. The animals are here,

are not the animals that were. The cipher is in the middle of _o_, _or._ 

I want her memory to continue forever. The _o_ begins expansion, opens up

carries impossible charges. The rim spins out beyond the orbit of the

farthest planet. The rim dissolves within a typical quasar illuminating

the galactic cluster. Her name is written on the rim, her name is written

everywhere, I know, I wrote it. It spins maybe out of control, it occupies

the clusters of space, it sings nowhere and everywhere at all, but I do

not know this, I do forgo this, I am gone, empty cipher, long long gone.
