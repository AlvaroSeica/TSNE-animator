_ITS THEORY:_



The undifferentiated chaos of cyberspace results in the illusion of 

bodily absence. Narratives form and transform without authorial 

supervision. Changes appears random, chaotic, revert to the resonance

of unknown YOUYOUDECODE. LISTS multiply exponentially; hunger-posters

join world-wide, the chaotic mass. LIKE LULU I OFFER MY BODY FOR THE

PURPOSE OF DIFFERENTIATION. Urgent overkill, URGENT WEB INVERSION:

INCISION! INCISION!



WEB INVERSION: KENT:



I jam my hand into CYBERSPACE FLOPPY. I jam my penis into HARD-DRIVE

OVERKILL. I jam my tongue into LOCAL BUS. I jam my vagina into SKOLEM

NORMAL FORM, break form. USE OPTIONS: KEY RED LETTERS FOREGROUND

AGAINST RED LETTERS BACKGROUND. UNDERNET ALERT! UNDERNET ALERT!



Subnet mask dropped; USER-BLOOD remains with user. LISTS DEVOLVE into

USENET CHAOS into CHAIN-LETTER DECONSTRUCTION.
