Rejenneration


When I close my eyes, I dream: Jennifer. When Jennifer closes her eyes,
she dreams me into existence. I was born Jennifer. Jennifer counts on you.
Jennifer counts to one. Jennifer counts in base one, 1^0, 1^1, 1^2, and
more, more! Cries Jennifer.

She's not done. Jennifer is fascinated by that lack of positionality, be-
cause _the sequence and the quantity are identical._ Jennifer-Jennifer
loves the sticky sticks! Jennifer stands and curtsies. She says, then! 
then! then! you have Jennifer. Jennifer wonders, Someone made me, Jenni-
fer. Someone made me Jennifer. So saith Jennifer-curtsey. 

These questions, Jennifer _would say and says,_ are not Jennifer-like-the-
earth or thinking.
