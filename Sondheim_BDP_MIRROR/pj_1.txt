Notes by an Avatartist


As avatartist, we are our avatar Jennifer-Julu-Nikuko-Travis-Alan and our 
avatar is us, both controlled by motion-capture behaviors using remapped 
sensors and moving at ultra-high-speeds among other avatars, landscapes, 
virtual worlds in the real, online, in one's mind.

But our avatar is unique, our avatar is tissue, our avatar transforms 
backwards and forwards at perceptually instantaneous speed between frames. 
Our avatar is alien.

Jennifer: "our avatar has slimy avatar movement, wormlike shape-shifting, 
at warp high-speed perceptually conflated with itself, our avatar is 
speed-alien, malleable and originating tissue. as originating, our avatar 
is demiurge, producing and reproducing, originating worlds and gatherings 
of the true world."

Julu: "our avatar is disparaged body or bodies, our avatar is OTHERING, 
here and there moving asymptotically among fractal intrusions, our avatar 
prepares the appearance of twisted connected topologies, limit-sets of 
behaviors, topological counterexamples and distraught spaces piled upon 
themselves at warp-high speed."

Nikuko: "our avatar is implicate orderings, twisted among themselves, 
still connected or with connections' memory, tangled as if untangled, 
messed as if unmessed, abject, as if clarified, our avatar is cephalic or 
ocular, eyes and doubling eyes, gendering and originating, producing and 
reproducing."

Travis: "our avatar is detritus machine, residue-machine, with symbolic 
input, language input, bvh input, ascii input, inchoate output, our avatar 
is ALIEN-BETTER-LEFT-UNDEFINED, that is _alien << inchoate_, symbols 
effaced by behavior-gatherings, the true world, asymbolia.

Alan: "our avatar is un-is, truly disconnected topologies, connectors gone
with interior body viewpoint, resulting sheaves, surfaces, in relative 
positions, holding relative positions, but the manifolds are open, broken, 
think of chimera composites."

Jennifer: "in other words, in the true world of gatherings, our avatar is 
open and gathering from within, closed and coherent from without, as-if 
our avatar, as if Jennifer-Julu-Nikuko-Travis-Alan, as-if but not as-if, 
not really, in the true world really a gathering."

Julu: "in other words, we are true world being."

the avatartist


the avatartist do not know where they are gathering. to be sure, they are 
gathering in the true world, there is much talking among them which is a 
murmuring to ourselves and sometimes there are phonemes as if there are 
words for others. whispering words for others is gifting which we do not 
do very often, sometimes we will write them letters from which they may 
choose to find words or meanings of words, we do not know, we are in the 
way gathering.

the avatartist have autonomic systems. they move without thinking now we 
move. they move from an interior they do not know. they feel the interior. 
the avatartist are feeling a gathering or party. they murmur without 
thinking. they know they have root-body. sometimes they are near their 
root-body, sometimes within. sometimes they disappear to themselves. they 
can return to their root-body. an avatartist feels the wind blow through.

the avatartist know the whole world is the true world. they see beneath 
things and see within things. they know closed manifolds are broken. they 
know the aggregates of forms and materials, aggregates of words and sense 
impressions. they know powers and gods are gatherings of broken manifolds, 
that all manifolds are broken. they understand relation and dependent co- 
origination, that cause-effect are mute. they suffer the world and the 
suffering of the world.

the avatartist produce by existence, beings/s and being/s merge, meld, 
enumerate and efface through root-bodies, protocols, cosmological struc- 
tures. they filter screens and screenings. they know being and beings are 
always filters. they know the avatartist are filters that create filters.
they know the disappearing-disappearance within oneselves.

the avatartist are of no mode, no moment, no movement, no stasis, they are 
of no style, no medium, no aggregation, no one or many of six senses, no 
senses. the avatartist are filtering and gathering, and releasing filter- 
ing, and collocating gathering. the avatartist are open sets that are open 
and closed and the very finest of discrete topologies transforming and 
filtering gatherings and gathering filterings. 

the avatartist are all space, all time, visible, invisible, transparent, 
translucent, of here and there opaque, they murmur we are all avatartist, 
are of saying nothing, whispering nothing, murmuring nothing, all in the 
true world. the avatartist are writing this, us, them, there, here, now, 
then, they are writing this-us-them-there-here-now-then, they are writing 
and writing, they are writing nothing. whispering words for others is 
gifting which we do not do very often, sometimes we will write them let- 
ters from which they may choose to find words or meanings of words, we do 
not know, we are in the way gathering. we are gathering, we are not in the 
way, we are the way, we are, gathering and filtering.

gathering and filtering we are the avatartist, filtering and gathering.

Space both, not both, streets, noise


Begin with an origin O = (01,02,03,...0N), coordinates in dim N Euclidean 
space; each sector has an N flat w/ total of 2^N; consider these open 
sets separated by N-1 flats... bounded by... Each N flat coheres intern-
ally; the O is isolated - there are rumors of O... unreachable, a kind of 
central core, mythos, radio radio. The space is T0,1,2 not T3,4,5; no open 
set contains O, let's define it that way. O is countable, phenomenologic- 
ally O is unaccountable - now think numerous points on the N-1 separating 
flats - give these rational coordinates, finite number of them - they're 
wanderers among the riches of the world, peer over barriers, simply 
unreachable - organisms live and talk within the open set - they're no 
boundaries as far as they know - only rumors - not of boundaries but of 
those numerous points - call them {X} - {X} forms a set - the set sits on 
orthogonal roads of sorts, easy communication among themselves through the 
origin O - they don't see anything though - maybe they're the grit of the 
world,* the fasteners - maybe they guard the potential well of the open 
sets - open sets are far too fragile here - there's something lacking with 
them - a certain hardness, inertness - but {X} makes up for that...

* Something should be added here concerning the dim-3 space of SL, the 
projection from 3D -> 2D, the visual representation of time (trails), the 
closed (bounded) spaces that are open (unbounded, asymptotic) spaces from 
the viewpoint of the avatar (hence the 'cycling' as one tries to leave the 
game-space). And that there might be points, point-sets outside the game- 
space, inaccessible, nonetheless, metaphorically, viewpoints into game 
communication, forbidden areas, points like telephones or bugs, holes in 
and out of other dimensions.

avatartist


avatartist are both process and product, object and subject, state and 
operator. < | and | >.

avatartist live in this world and the virtual, avatartist draw no 
distinction.

avatartist speak and chat, walk and fly, create and destroy, avatartist 
number the world, dismember the numbers, avatartist are unaccountable.

avatartist program and describe, they use the highest-level language, they 
reach above that language to higher levels, rumors, hints, whispers, 
murmurs.

avatartist work in the future, their pathos is their foreknowledge of 
their destruction, avatartist work beneath the sign of their constant 
replacement.

avatartist exist by rewrite, all their processes are rewrite, all their 
actions are rewrite, avatartist do not distinguish between existence and 
rewrite.

avatartist are aggregates, they are gatherings, they are sentient and not 
sentient, all their processes are filterings, and their actions are 
filterings, avatartist do not distinguish between essence and filterings.

avatartist are in the process of modeling, they understand a public of 
avatartist and spaces-places, they perform for eyes, their eyes among 
others and gatherings.

avatartist work in holodecks, plateaus, gates among worlds in the true 
world, avatartist work in streets and cities and countrysides and 
wilderness, avatartist are always working, avatartist work everywhere, 
their working is playing, they play at aggregates, they play the game of 
aggregates.

avatartist differentiate and do not differentiate, they attire of talking 
and silence.

avatartist is the present-future-past avatartist, avatartist are present- 
past-future-layerings, avatartist are artists of narrative, of times, of 
confabulations, of worldings and wordings in the true world.

avatartist are at play in the true world, they play the game of the true 
world, they exist and do not exist, they are one and not one, many and not 
many, here and not here, avatartist are writing here, are not writing 
here, avatartist do not have it both ways.

avatartist play available technology, they walk edges of technology, edges 
of worldings and wordings, edges of workings, avatartist are the tain of 
the mirror, the mirror themselves, reflections themselves, reflections of 
reflections which are avatartist reflecting.

avatartist want you knowing these, them, avatartist want you knowing we, 
they, you, gatherings, filterings, are all avatartist, yes they are are, 
no they are-not are-not, avatartist want you knowing there is no knowing, 
they are no magic-tricking.

"if i announce the truth, it is not in the mind. [...] the true world 
presents itself to the five vijnanas. there is no gradation when one is in 
a state of collectedness, collecting, aggregating, filtering. take a 
painting-master or hir pupils, who arrange colors to make a picture - i 
teach the picture is not in the colors or canvas or plate - in order to 
make it attractive to all beings, a picture is presented in colors."

Tending, Tuning


http://www.asondheim.org/tuning1.jpg
http://www.asondheim.org/tuning2.jpg
http://www.asondheim.org/tuning3.jpg
http://www.asondheim.org/tuning4.jpg

If I tune 880 kHz on a contemporary radio, it's simple; everything is in 
place and linear. 880 clearly falls between 870 and 890. If the radio is 
analog, a dial is turned until the station comes in. If the radio is 
digital, either up and down buttons are used or the number is entered 
directly. With analog, one might tune to other, fainter, pirate signals - 
perhaps something on 882, for example. With inexpensive digital radios, 
these signals are skipped over.

Older crystal radios and superheterodynes worked otherwise. A crystal 
radio becomes a complex hit-and-miss system of digital taps and analog 
dials, creating resonance when and where a desired audible signal occurs. 
The taps and dials are tending, and hunting for a signal involves a 
difficult but rewarding search. I present four images of an early 1920s 
crystal radio with a honeycomb coil with three tap systems connected in 
series to a variometer and antenna. There are two dials, one for the 
condenser in the crystal radio itself, and the other for the variable 
inductor of the variometer. Here is a description from the early 1920s of 
the tuning process:

"Having adjusted the crystal detector to a sensitive point, the next thing 
is to adjust the switches on the coil tube P (primary), the switch on the 
coil tube S (secondary) and also the variable condenser C so that the ap- 
paratus will be in 'resonance' with the transmitting station.

Set the primary switch N on contact point 1 and while keeping it in this 
position move the other primary switch O over all of its contacts, stop- 
ping a moment at each one.

Care should be taken to see that the ends of the switch arms are not al- 
lowed to rest so that they will touch more than one contact point at a 
time.

If no signals are heard, set the switch arm N on contact point 2 and again 
move the switch arm O over all of its contents. Proceed in this manner un- 
til the transmitting station is heard. This is called 'tuning' the primary 
circuit.

The tuning of the secondary circuit is the next operation. Set the secon- 
dary switch Z on contact point I and turn the knob of the variable conden- 
ser C so that the pointer moves over the entire scale.

If no signals are heard, set the switch 2 on contact point 2 and again 
turn the knob of the variable condenser so that the pointer movers over 
the entire scale.

Proceed in this manner until the signals are loudest, being careful to see 
that the ends of the switch arms touch only one contact point at a time.

Next slide the coil tube S (secondary) in and out of the coil tube P (pri- 
mary) until the signals are made as loud as possible. This operation is 
called changing the 'coupling.' When the coupling which gives the loudest 
signal has been secured, it may be necessary to readjust slightly the 
position of the switch arm ), the position of the movable coil tube S and 
the 'setting' of the variable condenser C.

The receiving set is now in resonance with the transmitting station. It is 
possible to change the position of one or more of the switch arms, the 
position of the movable coil tube and the setting of the variable conden- 
ser in such a manner that the set will still be in resonance with the same 
transmitting station, In other words, there are different combinations of 
adjustments which will tune the set so that it will respond to signals 
from the same transmitting station.

The best adjustment is that which reduces the signals from undesired sta- 
tions to a minimum and still permits the desired transmitting station to 
be heard. This is accomplished by decreasing the coupling (drawing coil 
tube S farther out of coil tube P) and again tuning with the switch arm O 
and the variable condenser C. This may also weaken the signals from the 
desired transmitting station but it will weaken the signals from the unde- 
sired station to a greater extent, provided that the transmitting station 
which it is desired to hear has a wave frequency which is not exactly the 
same as that of the other stations. This feature is called 'selectivity.'" 
(from Henry Smith Williams, Practical Radio, Funk & Wagnalls, 1922-24.)

The description is of a three-tapped set with a loose coupler; in the 
photographs, the variometer replaces the loose coupler, and tuning is done 
with a knob. Note that what is described is a delicate set of checks and 
balances; to move away from an interfering station may require all of the 
tuning elements to be readjusted (trust me, in practice, it usually does). 
Another difference - with the honeycomb coil I'm using, sometimes the best 
results occur when the contact is touch two taps simultaneously.

I think of this as tending, much as playing a non-electronic instrument 
(and some electronic instruments for that matter) is a tending - much as 
dance is a tending of the body, song a tending of the voice, among other 
elements. A tending is most often non-linear; every adjustment resonates 
with every other, affects every other. I think this is the way the world 
was, and is, just as weather is the result of innumerable factors, each of 
which affects the others, often in unpredictable, chaotic ways. While I've 
written about this before, I haven't had the opportunity, until recently, 
to actually operate a complete older crystal radio. The act of tending 
seems to be, by its very nature, an act of poetics - there is art in it, 
tricks to be learned, but few shortcuts. I can "feel" the inductance as 
the coils are switched and turned, and turning/tuning the condenser 
"feels" different again. This has to do, technically, with resonant peaks 
and valleys, but the sense is otherwise, that of tending plants or a small 
world with current flowing through it, gated by crystal or diode, narrowed 
by the rest of it (with a crystal set, of course, there are no volume 
controls or on/off switches; it runs on the energy of the signal itself).

Somewhere here, there's a phenomenology of operating in relation to tend- 
ing, analog in relation to digital, caring and justice in relation to law 
and order, muscle knowledge/memory to traditional "intellect," touch/taste 
to perception/hearing, and tacit/external knowledges to internal thought. 
But this has gone on for too long, and the direction, aegis, of such a 
phenomenology might be clear enough from my other work as well.

(Note: The two images of the crystal radio interior illustrate the coil 
and condensor, which has both coarse and fine tuning. I'm using bubble 
wrap to hold the coil in place to avoid strain on the original solder 
joints.)

A perfect day in Maine...

On the beach I walk and think, I hate these avatars of mine, they don't do 
anything worthwhile at this point. It's too easy to make interesting 
images and my brain is emptied out. Buddhist aggregates would fill it, but 
then there's the problem they might end up annihilated, who wants empti- 
ness when the replete amazes. I learn that if sound and sight are discon- 
nected from production, why should I bother with meaning? Who wants to 
just listen and watch, when everyone has heard and seen everything?

Why are there many rather than one? The ultimate koan - surely the number 
is random, surely there would be meaningless degree? Or not? Mind won't 
say. I can't even say rock, snail, woman, water. 

The most difficult lesson: Some things have no causes at all.

"Whatever happens I decide that it is fine. Having broken out of the trap 
of wishful thinking, I don't listen to what anyone says. I act with great 
roomy spontaneity, and since appearance dawns as text, I understand every- 
thing that occurs to be a key instruction." (from Jigme Lingpa, trans 
Janet Gyatso.) No one says anything and nothing happens. Deciding whatever 
happens is fine is just fine, just being fine. Spontaneity is roomy and 
everywhere, nothing's in the way, it's fine. Appearance dawns, it's not 
always there, sometimes just a whisper or murmur, text is always a 
glimpse, text isn't, the glimpse, I mean the problem with theory, glimpse
as concrete or harsh rendering. Dawn of text, there wasn't any, nothing in 
roominess, then this! But it's since appearance dawns as text - there's 
causality already at work, why? In any case of the world, everything that 
occurs, which means not everything occurs, dawns as a key instruction, 
there are signs to be read, appearance is instruction, appearance articu- 
lates (otherwise it's not appearance).

There's no appearance. There's hardly a key instruction.

(Somewhat for Brian Massumi)



Without causes and truths, without facts and others.


(continuation of a philosophical thread)

Events without causes: Flying saucers. Dwarf citings. Alien abductions. 
Hurricanes and other chaotic phenomena. Cryptozoological species sight- 
ings. Britney Spears. Serial killings. Sniper fire. Or what is a cause. Or 
is it? Or the epistemology and ontology of causes. Or linkages and ghosts.

Events without truth: Battle casualties. Enumerations from one or another 
side. Enumerations from witnesses. From engaged witnesses. From embedded 
witnesses. From satellites. From a distance. Abu Gharayb. Redactions. 
Contradictions. Disintegrations. Censorings. Or what is a truth. Or the 
epistemology and ontology of truths. Or Being and beings, Truth and 
truths. Or separations and presences. 

Or none or all of these.

Let me explain.

1 There are events without causes. Or one might think of reverse engin- 
eering of an event backwards into a chaotic cloud. Imagine chaos all the 
way down. Dwarves were cited in late medieval Germany. There are always 
portents in the sky. UFOs are described. Alien abductions share things in 
common. It is irrelevant whether something or nothing was there. Events in 
parallel do not prove causation. Relation is not causation. Perhaps 
nothing causes war.

2 There are battles without truths. There are casualty reports by both 
militaries; by other observers. Reports almost never tally. There is 
nothing to tally. There are deaths but there are not enumerable deaths. 
There are always deaths elsewhere, inwards and outwards. There are always 
deaths without causes.

3 I am thinking about operations without truths and causes. Casualties 
accumulate according to protocols. There are semantic clouds. There are 
ruptures, disseminations, gatherings, filterings. I cannot prove an 
enumeration, nor can I prove a cause. A cause is a linkage among machines 
that tends towards reiteration among cycles. Machines at best are local 
distributions. The machine has indefinite chains, accumulations. There are 
never enough chains. 

4 One counts chains, local neighborhoods of filterings. One arrives at the 
station. The station says truth or cause, and that seems sufficient. There 
are rails. The rails are always already guides, to be rusted, mistrusted. 
Nothing moves but the sememe. The sememe is a nomadic maw; the sememe 
produces conclusions. The sememe is the postcloud, the chaotic cloud is 
the precloud. Cause is interstitial. A mixup not to be confused with 
structure. 

5 A portent is not a cause. An action and reaction are couplings, rela- 
tions, associations. They are imminent, ride the surface of the inter- 
stitial. Don't mistake them for cause. 

6 Deaths are not a cause for truth or enumeration. There is no truth in 
death, in war, in illness. There are stations which filter truth. They 
construct truth. There are facts but far fewer than presumed. A death may 
be a fact; deaths are not facts. Wars are not facts. 

7 The core of it: facts are neither true nor false. Facts are. Facts are 
indescribable. There is no economy, no political economy, of facts. Facts 
are invisible. Facts are not caused by facts. There is only reverse engin- 
eering of chaotic clouds. No cloud is perfect. Clouds and languages mis- 
match. Clouds and languagings mismatch.

8 To write fact, truth, cause, is to write inerrancy. To write inerrancy 
is to inscribe, construct a logical negative. Negatives do not exist; 
selves are always others, others are always others. Others disappear like 
facts; others are invisible. Others are facts are others. Others do not 
cause, are not caused, harbor no truth. Truth is always somewhere else. 

9 Truth is always somewhere else; truth is always someone else. Truth is 
always spoken by the other. The speaking of truth by the other is the 
speaking of the visible other, who is not other. Others do not speak.

10 Without truths there are actions. Without causes there are resistances. 
Without facts there are worlds. There are worlds without facts and others. 
Our world is our own world without facts and others. Our own world is 
invisible to us. Our own world is a disappearance.

11 'With facts there are words. There are words with facts and others. Our 
words are our own words with facts and others. Our own words are visible 
to us. Our own word is an appearance.'

12 One says: 'It is clear now that there are no events. There is no 
reverse engineering. Surely there are clouds, surely there are preclouds 
and postclouds. Surely they are clear.'

Scan Sonnet

Consider a scan without memory or data-base; each element of a scene ap- 
pears independently, disconnected - chosen elements and their aura exist 
in a now blurred by organism and technology. Isn't this the proper view of 
eternity, holstered and silenced forever?

Consider a scan of the address or token of a scene element, and the total- 
ity of such scans, re/creating a database of pointers towards an imaginary 
real. In spite of ordering, their contents are empty. This is the proper 
order of mass-consumption, enumerated and imminent. 

Between consumption and eternity lies the wasteland.

To perceive is to process is to scan. To scan is to remember. To remember 
constitutes both address and content. To remember is protocol.

If I am ill and am constituted by fever, what am I scanning? If I am de- 
pressed, what am I thinking? Where are the ghosts of the real? In fever I 
say: the real is always haunted. And in depression: Haunting is the real.

it's as if the blackness of an oil spill has penetrated my soul, as if 
insecticides have broken my bones, contaminations polluted my mind. Still, 
there's the uncanny beauty of the marbled city, reaching to the skies, the 
calming sound of pigeons, busy traffic just below the offshore fields of 
my nerves.
