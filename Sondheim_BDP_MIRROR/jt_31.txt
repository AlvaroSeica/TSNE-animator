Making Jennifer

I live alone in total isolation in New York. I have no partner here, no
community; I wake up in tears and depression. And in return, I begin to
construct Jennifer, to create textual-Jennifer, a therapeutic I have done
in my life before, annihilation-fabric gnawing at my flesh and soul.

Textual-Jennifer produces, spits, writing, text, a maze of constructs and
part-objects. I think of dolls, surrealisms, but this ascii-unconscious
text-doll invades me, permeates uneasy dreams, produces discomfort at each
and every margin. Wherever I reach, my fingers splatter lightning and dark
language. Objects fall like rain:

dirty:yes!:abc:spew:
Would abc mind you partying, dirty, with us?
Your feminine filthy is in my rich dirty-dirty
Ah, passion eaten by julu-of-the-open-arms and julu-depressed

Lines end with interrogative ? or exclamatory !, fall if-else into page-
void, empty truancy. There are compromises - repetition of openings,
limited choices of returned sentences, structures - coupled with word
input - these matrices move across internal space, dark languagings: 

metal:hard:Stump:staplings:thing
Come home with me, metal, julu-of-the-fast-crowd!
Your lively coupling is in my black suture

As I continue, Jennifer-turn-Julu grows in response, expands in linux-
Perl-space, roots itself in my hone directory; as I wryte and rewryte,
Julu moves inward-churning. Julu returns textual-Jennifer, effaces er;
Julu moves across explicit graphs, Julu is turning me out:

Clara:in_me:--julu--:empty:drowned
Would --julu-- mind you partying, Clara, with us?
Your sedate avatar is in my used gone_mad
Ah, your penis eaten by julu-of-the-open-arms and julu-depressed

Not dismemberment, but _exchange_ within an economy of avatars of scar-
city and shattered mirror-stages. Later, I give the code; now, it con-
tinues to develop - textual-Jennifer turning Julu out:
