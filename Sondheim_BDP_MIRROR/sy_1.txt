it's depressing being alive
it's depressing being
dream with me of violent white men
come and smash anything that moves
shooting the white out of the eyes of others
others who don't look back
this country flees into this country
this country's in it for the long haul
everybody is every body and then some
violent white men choke yourselves to death
violent white men clean up after every crime
you don't believe me sue the president
look he's still moving sue him again
i'm a corporation you can't kill me
i'm a religion that tells me to kill you
there's every difference in difference
you can't vote unless you turn your skin in
violent white men go ahead push the lever
the votes are in go ahead executioners
i win the vote you're dead
it's depressing being alive anyway
it's depressing being
really depressing being
go ahead

just traded today for an alto clarinet, i haven't
played this before, and needed some time away from
everything else, exploring the dynamics, terrain,
of the instrument, invisibility! timbre! manacles!



United States Music and Maps

http://www.alansondheim.org/maps02.jpg

recently traded for an Irish banjo and here is a medley,

http://www.alansondheim.org/lillilt1.mp3 which I quite like,
almost like being there (here, where i'm playing)

i also found an original copy of the first geography of the 
United States, from 1784, by Jedidiah Morse, father of Samuel 
Morse, painter and inventor of the telegraph. the book is 
missing the first ten pages, which were xeroxed in. i have no 
idea of the history of this particular volume; it's strange and 
utterly wonderful. it contains four _word maps_ - the only other 
word map i've seen is from 1300s China, reproduced below as 
well. (note the U.S. map is missing about a third on the right.)

belief takes our breath away and the wall's a virgin
scorched earth and someone's lying there
no wait there's two of them and one's hard like stone
one's a stone and one's fire and one's earth
everything's got hands everything takes everyone

Ye diff'rent sects, who all declare,
"Lo here is Christ, or Christ is there!"
Your stronger proofs divinely give,
And show us where the Christians live!

Your claim, alas! ye cannnot prove;
Ye want the genuine mark of love:
Thou only, Lord, thine own canst know
For sure thou hast a church below.

Scatter'd o'er all the earth they lie,
Till thou collect them with thine eye.
Draw by the music of thy name, 
And charm into a beauteous frame.

For this the pleading Spirit groans, 
And cries in all thy banish'd ones:
Love, greatest of thy gifts impart,
And make us of one mind and heart.

Join ev'ry soul that looks to thee,
In bonds of perfect charity:
Now Lord, they glorious fulness give,
And all in all for ever live.

- Anonymous (Universal Psalmist, 1833)

"VII

The analogy of lamplight and pramanas adduced by the opponent is 
unfit, because the lamplight cannot illuminate darkness, since 
no connection is possible between them.

It must be said:

7. The lamplight, either connected or not connected with 
darkness, does not illuminate.

The lamplight, either illuminates with being connected with 
darkness, or illuminates without being connected (with it).

(We have it that) the lamplight cannot illuminate being 
connected with darkness, since (that) connection is not 
(possible), because the lamplight and darkness do not get 
connected as they are opposed. Where the lamplight is, there 
darkness is not; consequently how the lamplight could either 
remove or illuminate darkness?

Also (the lamplight cannot illuminate) not being connected (with 
darkness), as the sword that is not in contact (with something) 
does not cut (it)."

From Nagarjuna's Refutation of Logic (Nyaya), Vaidalyaprakarana, 
edited and commentary, Fernando Tola, Carmen Dragonetti, 
pp. 60-61

Where one is, the other is not, or: One and the other both are, 
but of the darkness, a focus, and of the lamplight, a focus. Or 
an imposition or a superimposition, entangled, but neither one 
nor the other.

Pramana - here, the means of valid knowledge,
Prameya - here, the knowable (object)

From IV: 

"Pramana and prameya as mutually dependent are neither existent 
nor non-existent nor existent and non-existent.

Moreover

4. An existing (thing), a non-existing (thing), and a thing that 
were both are not dependent (on something other)."

(p. 59, end of something other)

Now then presuppose the darkness as monstrous, the lamplight as 
flickering, what then?

It is present, it is past forgetting; they are present, they are 
past forgetting. They will be forgotten, they will be past 
forgetting. They forget. The darkness forgets the darkness, the 
lamplight forgets the lamplight. Substitute a Victor. The Victor 
forgets the darkness, the darkness forgets the Victor. The 
Victor forgets the lamplight, the lamplight forgets the Victor.

But are they not for example vestiges of lux?
Or of radiation or its lack, there you are, dark matter a 
vestige of darkness?

Where might one find a photo? Virtual particle? Neutrino? It is 
luminous, this darkness within the red and darkened lamplight, 
it is sexual, yes, the means of valid knowledge.

shallow shoreline beyond which I dared not venture,
heading there, the S was lost or hallowed ground
daylight remains fallow, graves are always shallow,
life is never hallowed, signs are born from sorrow,
hallowed, deep or shallow, always nude and proper,
foaming ride on the surface, unfolding hallowed shallows,
so shallow, that it rides foam-like on the surface of the sky,
oh shallow to follow the shadow to the pond,
something in the depths, something hardened, hallowed,
he headed towards the shallows and the S was lost

http://www.alansondheim.org/duchampkills1.png

Duchamp Kills: how often I've chanted that slogan!
And for good reason, shrapnel everywhere, war or 
no war, gangs or no gangs. Raiders violating every
fucking body, constant roar of shrapnel, bombs,
not even punctuated by the cries of the wounded. A
wrong turn for modern art when we lost the way of 
the people, when we turned away from war, except as
exhilaration, acute angles, planes cut into each
other until some of then escaped, returned to drop
angels among the rest of us, fucking angels killing
everything in sight. We should have known better, 
we should get down on our knees and pray that we
turn towards the pain everywhere in the world and 
we have to do what we can to overturn the damage we
have done in our failure to recognize the deep root
of culture falling through the earth towards the 
very center of our Being. Duchamp kills, modern art
kills, modern culture kills, deconstruction kills,
and we cannot forget the deaths we have ignored, 
the pain we have caused everyone who is not of us,
the torture we can never absolve, deaths and more
deaths, more of everything, more of everyone as well.
