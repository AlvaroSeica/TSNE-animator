brief note



from Nikuko - "I can drive the voices out of my head temporarily by asking

them to shut up, be quiet; sometimes this leads to more and more chatter

as one objection after another is offered. It's exhausting. Sometimes

there's a break of a few seconds, though, during which I regain strength,

inhabit silence, rest. I almost beg them. I'll whisper to them, as if that

would make any difference. They go on about all sorts of things. They in-

sist they have nowhere else to talk. Usually it's about trivia - things to

do, events of the day, the latest gossip, revenge scenarios. I've tried to

take more control - I really have. If I start singing, one or another of

them takes over, and that's no help. I wonder who's making the requests;

I desperately need sleep, not these incessant voices ..."
