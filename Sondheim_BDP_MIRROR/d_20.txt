The Sonnet of Insulting God





If I insult God running down the wires

Will I burn hard interminably in fires -

Will I burn terminals dissolute, enmired 

If I curse God pouring through the wires -

If I trample Holy Names, scream my desires

Will infants die, angels sing in choirs

Cursing a male, email, female joined in wires

If I burn Names, illuminated fires -

Let me burn a God whose Name is now enmired

In centuries of pain, perverse desires

Sung by third-sexed angels, fucking choirs

Of she male, see male, female in the wires -

If I burn Names, illuminated fires

Let me burn both mine and thine, 

			borne in the wires
