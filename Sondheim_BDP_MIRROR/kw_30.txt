in this dream there were walls and waves beyond, and there were objects
come forth from the walls, hardened electricity, ready to burst, of all
sorts, some of which my friends could see, all of which were visible to
me. and oh, upon waking, all those energies from the storms about, brood-
ing and sullen - all those energies collapsed into perfect writings from
other worlds, of which I am grateful to be the conducer, the channeler,
the flow-by-night-and-day, the dream-weaver, the shape-rider. in truth it
is your shape always behind me, always within me, that turns with the
force of several horse-power, an alternating-current motor running my
images against the inert and shattered real of everyday life. so in this
dream, there was a patent number, and that patent number was you.
