working slowly through different scales, at the
same time, well it might as well be in the middle
of the night, it seems all the time, the saz is a
meditation, one moves majestically among the 
plateaus of the instruments, its fields and 
vectors, its moment where virtue falls by the 
wayside, replace by nothing, its catering to the
horseman riding through a forest, the path is
at the edge of a ravine, there are grasses and
gnarled trees, the hot sun but the brook below,
the blue sky but the dust beneath

it's too strong


it's right here


it's right in the middle of us


it twists and turns


there's no end to it


in a conversation with Ken Wark 
I invented the word codework
we were discussing the bones of the text
modified by a computer so that the bones
were the program within the language and
both were speaking


it churns


she said when I die because I'm afraid of death
and weep and wail about it
that she'd take care of it


night having the horrors of death and
disfiguration


codework destroys the language given to us with
the uneasy birthright of Cain,
 
the mark on Cain is the terminal prompt \

decoding the journeys of the Wandering Jew, an
.stl file that prints out the world's body


it looms


it's born on a loom and dies on a loom, as it grows,
it weaves itself


it weaves itself into a loom and grows itself


it grows turning and it says to itself
i turn left
i turn right


chiasm it crosses itself 
it grows churning and it says to itself

center right center center left
center left center center right


it swallows time it's the family favorite
i kill my father and mother i kill my sister and
brother i kill my son and daughter
i'm the family favorite, i'm the family favorite


it melds
it erases its Origin
it erases the INTERSECTION OF THE 
 ABCISSA AND ORDINATE

it's somewhere


it's really something


it's somewhere


it's somewhere DIIRTY


I think of the dance as a whirl without consent, like the body burning, or
 like a singer without a song, totally open to the world, no computer,
    I think of an inverted hysteria, the world as symptom of this

 it wobbles on pivots, it gyres on axes, it twists
and turns, 
 it turns away the face, the face of the world is the dance 


the world of the face is the trance


I think the hands hold old-fashioned canes and crushes these could be
		  quite dangerous wobble turn around


I think you leave holding hands 


my heart
bursts open

my heart
bursts open, and blood everywhere, this burst heart! And then I no longer
	   think, my whirling body-heart, body-burst-heart!

    I think of an inverted hysteria, the world as symptom of this
 burst-heart-body, world roiling and heaving system fast rotation and
				wobble

I think the hands hold old-fashioned canes and crushes these could be
		  quite dangerous wobble turn around


      pulling forth the cane from the body can only be imagined

		   the body is the dream of freedom
		  the dance is the dream of freedom
		      dream of freedom, the cane



i remember she didn't have to die 
for once the doctors were right
death claims those who ignore


who sway to the right move to the left
who move to the left sway to the right

who sway to the left move to the right
who move to the right sway to the left


I'll see your eyes. I'll see your face. Language is an enemy. Language
is the enemy. 

Get out. Get out of here. I'll see your face. I'll see your eyes.


I get into the ocean. I get out of the sea.

I get out of the sea. I get into the ocean.


poetry is an emergency

poetry is always an emergency



a steep hill with wooden steps near the top 
 an abandoned apartment
second floor a picture i know there 
 forget now
someone i know lived around the apartment
in Providence it was a guitar maker from back then


plane crash in the north back yard
splits open filled with medicine bottles

a bad one


in a house with saxophone players but we're talking
they leave it's dark out dangerous i'm alone
need to get out of there find somewhere

not home but somewhere i'm staying or something


just five minutes after i'm dead 
what will she see

the engine which vanquishes the same

desire drawn forth and vanquished, and who may

what skin or leaf

For Geoff Dugan and the ambiance

Worked with Geoff Dugan today, playing a number of
instruments for experimental production of ambient
and instrumental sonorities. Three of the pieces 
we did present pump organ works recorded inside our
1878 Beatty instrument; these will be combined with
Geoff's recording and we'll see what emerges. In 
the meantime, enjoy the pump organ; I'm happy to 
say that the bellows are still intact and relatively
tight, and everything still works. The low notes are
particularly interesting, I think; they sound like
64' pipes, but I'm not sure, how could I be?

floods in the works of i back upon hirself, reminiscent of i's 
position of woman as both literal and hir senses). consider for a

maqet

http://www.alansondheim.org/maqet.mp4

more and more we move towards the recognition
of something that carries ourselves into this
others world only to have them collapses onto
itself towards the end of extinctions of your
lives and form and so these amount to numbers
and codes and among them circulations of such
account as you might tally of animals and too
of plants and too of flora and too of fauna i
knew and harbored more and more the soft skin
and more and more the hard bones of all these
you remember and might have sadly named there
and now the deaths arising and moving here in
these vast unlabeled regions


alone in the woods i don't care what you say
i wish i was a yankee in the boulders
the old man of the mountain crashed after the coin
i'll sit and think here it's the only place
my free body cragged in fissured time
i didn't know they could think that smart
geology is a rock in a rock
a rock on a rock is a stratum
nothing glows like inner glows in a stream
it's dark and shadowy streaming in these nice woods
the ground remembers a history of warmth
ground follows ground until something stops it
down below above is more of the same behind its back
black smokers harbor life i'd like to be
still me a different thing is alone in the forest
i wish i was a yankee there i wish i was a stone
