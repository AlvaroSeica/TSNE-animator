I wanted to gather together URLs for purchase etc. of my work available 
online. This is probably incomplete, but for those who are interested, it 
is probably useful. Note that Printed Matter carries a number of things.
I definitely recommend the books - VEL, The Wayward, Sophia, .echo. There 
are days I wish I was a store. Those are the days I could still wish.
