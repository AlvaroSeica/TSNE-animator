lament maquette for the dead as the world oozes human beings
human beings come forth and gather their dead and die

the virtual is the pain of the real and an escape
the virtual is powered by the pain and escapes into the virtual

o real pain o virtual
o doom of memory o dead soldiers o stuck flesh o martyrologies

you are deaf and hear nothing but your pain
call you forth and you hear nothing and what is survive

radio makes those sounds when you are not listen
radio make those sounds and murmur when you are

they get stuck in this life and yearn to return to the other

in pain in doom of memory in soldiers in yearning
in returning in memory in stick in lives and in survive

you hear nothing and you listen and read forth and this is a thing
it is a thing like no other listen and reading it comes forth

it comes forth swaying and swings from one to a return to an other
it goes forth dying and sways into another of your own world

i steal your own world from you and your virtual too
i steal your avatar and play it sound on radio here

you listen and you are stuck here in your long to return to an other
i succeed and you are stuck here in your long to return to an other

you listen you

you are stuck in pain, you are held back, you cannot move

they get stuck in this life and yearn to return to the other

they are held back by memory and skin which falls from their seasons

they cannot move but are made from layers torn from their flesh
