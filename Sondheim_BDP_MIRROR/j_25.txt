Confession of Writing

I write because if I don't, I'd kill myself. I write because I don't want 
to think of my past. I write because I had good times then and depression
now and I don't want to think of the good times. I think because I don't
want to think. I write because something will bring back a memory and I
don't want memory, nothing from my life. I write because I was alive once.
I write because I can never figure out enough. I write because there is no
other reason for my cyborg existence. I write because if I don't I'll fall
out the window. I write because if I stop I place the bag over my head,
set fire to the world. I write because the saying of the world stops the
world. I write because I don't want the world to stop. I write because I
am without hope. I write because the earth becomes darker with each passing
year. I write because there is no culture, no first, second, third cul-
tures, no first, second, third, fourth, fifth worlds. I write because there
are photographs I cannot look at, images that surround me, haunt me, invade
my dreams. I write because I am invaded. And I write because I do not know
the truth about this, or any other thing.
