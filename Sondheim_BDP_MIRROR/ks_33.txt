Holderlin's


  Voll Gut' ist; keiner aber fasser       Full good is, but no one grasps
Allein Gott.                                   alone God. / God alone.

To begin (Tubingen comes to mind) Patmos. That this version virgin still
escapes. This later Patmos. Jennifer with hands wide open. Fingers
splayed. Jennifer with hardened circumambulation. No community. That Alan,
dead: She speaks. Sacrifice of Alan. So that she grasps. They said:
"Jennifer is grasping." "Something's missing in her." "She's a ruin." They
said: "Whatever it is, it's got to be good." They said: "Jennifer's too
good for herself." Meant her clothes thin, "you can see everything there."
Her constant God-yammering. "She'd fuck Him." Constant: "He'd fuck her."
Harder. No communion. She knew: "God would fuck her if He could." She knew
"He couldn't": her strength. She wore Her Skin in Her Skin. Virgin God
"couldn't" do a "Thing." Erosion of storms in laughter. Her olive Face,
Her black Eyes, Her black Hair. God fastened on Her. God fascinated. His
Offering.

- God.
