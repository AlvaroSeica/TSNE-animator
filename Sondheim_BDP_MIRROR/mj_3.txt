memory


it comes to me in the night. it's in the form of glowing cacti, golden 
arms. it a kernel or generator. something emerges, expands.
i will write it down. or i will forget, feverish. 
now there is this image: the expanding golden man with spines.
the concept of it, or the narrative, caressed in disappearance.
i will write it down. i will type it out.
weary, i will walk downstairs, waiting for you.
if you are in my machine, glowing arms, i will hear you.
if you are moving through my files, i will search you out.

Essay for Graduate Record Exams (GRE) from a dream:


On a Shelf, The Futility of Being

Here, on a shelf in my unaccustomed house, bottles and dishes are linked 
together by association. Perhaps a plate is nestled upon another; perhaps 
a bottle sits next to a bottle. All of these objects occupy my field of 
view together, as if they are simultaneous, connected by other than their 
random placement.

Ah, if they were only linked, the fate of one connected to the fate of 
all! But such is not to be. Thus we divide the world into those objects 
and associations deeply committed to one another, embedded within each 
other, dependent upon one another - and those objects whose being in 
relation to one another is nothing more than futile. Shamefully they 
insist on connection that is not there; they exhaust themselves in the 
effort, and to no avail.

warmth


Jennifer wonders about her new boy. Jennifer says, when we cuddle together 
we are very very warm. Jennifer's boy wonders about this. Jennifer says, 
look at it this way. We are warmer for two reasons. Where our bodies 
touch, we are not cold and we pass warmth among us so that the warmth is 
there and nice with us, and our bodies come together in warmth and 
coolness and then warmness all over. And our skin which is not touching, 
that skin is less than the separate skins of our separate selves. And so, 
her boy says, if we adopt a third, there will be even less surface and 
more inside and lovely warmth. yes yes says Jennifer, and we can add a 
fourth and fifth, and her boy says as we add more and more, the surface is 
smaller and smaller compared to all the lovely warmth inside. Oh yes says 
her boy, if we had hundreds and hundreds, why then so many will be so 
lovely warmth inside all over, and on the surface, even then only half 
will be cold and the other half warmed by the great engine within. Yes, 
says Jennifer, and we will be a part of that great engine and all warmed 
with that lovely warmth and all toasty. We are warmed by our thinking says 
Jennifer's boy. Yes yes yes says Jennifer, we are very warmed by our 
hundreds of thinking thoughts and bodies surrounding us in such lovely 
warmth.

Jennifer's essay on warmly warm

warmly warm is when you're very very safe and cuddly and there is your boy
and your stuffed animals and a lot of blankets and there are no terrorists
under the bed or looking in your windows and you feel nice and warmly warm
and there are no bad people and no robbers and you know you will have
sweet dreams all night long and your boy's arms are around you and the
whole world is leaving you alone and maybe smiling and everyone is very
very quiet and you feel so snuggly and so very full of love and you know
everyone and everyone is so very warmly warm and happy and peaceful and no
one will ever ever die and everyone has enough to eat and time to sleep
and play and do wonderful things and no one is ever ever sick and you fall
asleep so very warmly warm and happy and your stuffed animals are happy
too and quietly talking together

 As unbelievable as it may sound, we are happy to say that our success
rate with NewCurves is 89%! I know this may be a bit hard to swallow, so
I'd like to share with you some success stories of just a few of our
numerous satisfied clients: "I started using NewCurves 10 days ago. I was
told by one of your representatives that it takes about 5 to 6 weeks to
see results, so I never expected to see results before then. Two days ago
as I was massaging the cream, my breasts felt a little larger but I really
didn't give it much thought. That night, my boyfriend said that I looked
bigger. I couldn't believe it. I kept telling him it's too soon, it's only
been 10 days. But he said 'Look, your bra is too tight, it fit you fine
before.' Those were the sweetest words I had ever heard. I am so excited
about NewCurves. I just can't wait to see the change it will make in the
coming weeks."

Jennifer's essay of pride and cowardice


god did not intend for humans to populate the earth. by virtue and example
of the first death, there's death for everyone. by virtue of the first
murder, there's everyone's murder, our true disappearance. we're all
chosen people; our time has come, we'll bring ourselves down. because of
abraham, moses, jesus and mohammed, prophets of one and scapegoats of the
other, we're the seeds of world destruction. by virtue of einstein, cosmos
and energy-mass. by virtue of bin-laden and bush, unleashing of fermi and
binding of newton, by virtue of marx and stalin, lincoln and lenin, the
harnessing of humanism in the enlightenment of the slave. god did intend
us to perish, i'm sure. i'm the prophet of perishing. i'm the prophet of
preparation.  listen and believe, believe and listen. i'm the prophet of
mass-destruction, of energy-mass destruction. truly everyone's afraid, and
most of all, of me. of me, me, me. of me.

the zone


this is the zone, dave said, you go to the zone. that's how we survive
here. in the zone we're open to the world. it's not something i can
describe. it's outside of language. it's a sensitivity to the timing and
passing of familiar things. it's a withdrawal of the human from imminence,
it's keenness and meditation, it's the ululations changing pitch around
the pond at two in the morning, and the sound of wood stork wings at the
breeding ground at five in the afternoon. the ululations changed pitch,
holding the onset and rhythm through everything. at one end of the pond,
other animals were signaling; everything was loud, energetic, and out of
site at two in the morning. we crawled back through the thicket,
photographing inside animal holes and those cavernous spaces beneath the
root structures of overturned trees. there were several closeup images of
cormorants, showing the structure of the back feathers. there were large
egrets and a white morph of the great blue as well as several green herons
feeding. cormorant young were everywhere. at shark valley, the anhinga
chicks were just about ready to fly away. we stopped tourists from
throwing sticks at an alligator, which was furious and moving at lightning
speed. i yelled at twenty of them. i was a madman in the zone. you go to
the zone, dave said, that's how you survive here. we can enter the zone
any time. it's emptied of people. other things are speaking or quiet;
other things approach like the peculiar anole that sat for :we were back
out on the southern road to flamingo; the small unmarked boardwalk was
dry, the periphyton turned to mud. this time we went out to the end at
christian point; there were small crabs of two types, and horseshoe crabs
washed up and dead on the shore. the cacti thickened nearer the coast, and
the tri-lobed form gave way to six-lobed and then almost columnar links at
the tip. the periphyton was dried, desert-dried, and there were black and
light-grey lichen across the mud-flats. the first time we took the trail,
there were magnificent osprey; this time, nothing. but at the farthest
pond there were two roseate spoonbills. i looked for swallow-tailed kites
or snail-kites at the stop-off points, but none were to be seen. a lot of
blue tilapia on the anhinga trail. no more deer, just dried and desiccated
landscape, various small flowers. all of the mangrove were doing well,
both red and black in the desert meadow of christian point. and somewhere
we heard parrots.:today we rescued one of the larger slugs; for the first
time i was ensured it wasn't a flatworm - its head appeared at the upper
end. the spider, about three centimeters across, managed to rebuild its
web. the synchronous ululations of the frogs stopped; they were apparently
signaled by yesterday's rain. in the thicket,, the medallion or blood-
sucking conenoses were out again; this identification is hazy, incorrect,
confusing. there were two albino ones, all pink and red and yellow, about
an inch and a half in length and an inch in width. they had moved to
different branches on another tree. we found our first slime mold, yellow
and bulbous, in the thicket as well. and some strange small reddish birds;
i'll get the identification later.::i'll get them all, these repeated
images, five-hundred nine so far,

repeated images, hardly moving at all. our favorite anole, beautiful and
courageous and in love with innovati0n.X Folder: INBOX M My repeated
images, hardly moving at all. our favorite anole, beautiful and coura
geous and in love with innovation.

sadness of world askew


we're thrown to a halt, run out, stop traffic. she's sitting there. all
among the fairest; suffice if one voice of the cars and trucks slow
around.

any darkness, weather, i'd say that we, on mangrove roots, closeup:
barnacles, limpets, mussels, mangroved say eternity, if animals still
roamed free, if there were animals, oysters, worm tubings. i dream of
land's end images, they claw at me, a god was here, so glorious in
us, all among the fairest; message down in the water of the continent.

down with bodies floating in the stream of stories. If you drown,
it is data you drown; if you write, you're written. write and you drown;
the cacti vines, looking grafted, even over, of the web of eternal life, 
a number of deaths, swallow-tailed kites high above turkey buzzards,
cormorant perch suffice in my contrary red white black of twist.

if you get death, there are countries full of them, the ink, your lungs
of darkness and dark ink.

creatur pink flux in hole to the foot. ... ...  belief in atomic light ...
... mouthtime.

i know i can count on you and i promise i will never let you down, heart
shatter and your child her period, our country, its dark mouth.
