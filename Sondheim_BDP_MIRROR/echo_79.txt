belief





:"You must really believe in writing," said Nikuko, "to continue in this

almost linear manner, texts with perforations and tendrils. In the future

none of this will survive. Don't you think you're doing nothing but writ-

ing your own epitaph?"::"If there is life, there is inscription," Alan

replied. "These texts are world, enclosed and comforted by their presence

and dissemination. Enter them, and you enter me. Return to them; your mind

is always already elsewhere." :"dissemination" said Alan The chorus spoke.

"They are incisions within the sememe, exposing the interior. They are not

the belief in writing, but the writing itself, which inscribes belief."



"your space replete fecundity" said the chorus "is on my summits" 

"prolongation" said Nikuko
