                        my home has a roof, 
                           no ceiling; yours,
                              a ceiling, no roof -
                        upside-down,
                           legs in the air -





apology

it is a weakness of mine to write couplets, not facticity:
oh there may be a distinction or there may not be:
all these terms already shorn of their long hair,
placed within the discomfiture of a porcelain mortar:
but this is a land of extreme enervations,
and there is an enormous doorknob, very subtle sounds of clicking
deep within the brass lock, that must be placed hard about it:
a cylinder:
i am waiting for survival
