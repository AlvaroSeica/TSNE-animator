idiot! three people pass each other on the street
idiot! they form a configuration
idiot! that configuration will never exist again
idiot! there's a meeting with eight members of my class in 1972
idiot! intensely i'm in there among the students
idiot! this is gone, it's obdurate, always inconsequential
idiot! when something goes there's never any proof,
        not of the details, not of the tenor of the world
idiot! what was platt townend wearing that day on the corner
idiot! what year was that, how many before 1960
idiot! the world is nothing but those corners
idiot! our whole lives are structured against that meeting
        of the eight members of the class or that passing
        of those three people on the street
idiot! oh oh oh this is so maudlin and trite, but that's not
        the point, well what is
idiot! that every moment of the world's existence is a rock
idiot! we're smashed against that rock
idiot! our bodies crumble, they're repeatedly smashed
        rock after rock after rock
        until one day we're dead and part of the rock
idiot! who cares if someone else is doing the smashing
idiot! the rock's there at dawn, it was there at midnight
idiot! the rock's there at dusk, it was there at noon
idiot! this is so stupid, it's the stupidest thing
        i ever said, it's maybe the food i ate or something
        happening like uneasy atmosphere or dark premonitions
        i should take it back, i've got a war against idiocy
        i'd beg you to kill me but it would be too good
idiot! there's always the rock and i sacrifice to it
idiot! that's enough, there's no more song-sungable
