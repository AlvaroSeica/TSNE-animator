You


Your packets and mine, intertwined, subdomains alternating one after ano-
ther, caressing your ascii-encoded limbs, opening your email over and over
again; 

holding my breath against your domain address, turning towards, always
towards, your name in my Inbox, reading your full header, pausing at each
stage tracerouting myself to you, and back, journey of space, copper, and
fiber-optic heavens;

calling out your URL in my sleep, dreaming your green words on my black
screen, voicing your writing, speaking it quietly in your absent voice,
and I close my eyes, imagine the play of interrupts from keyboard through
server out to the wide wide world;

wanting you here, no longer driven by pixels bitmapped through checksums
and error-codes, wanting you here,

wanting you here, wanting you here and hating distance and impossibility,
and lags, and message-bases, and five layers of numerous protocols, seven
layers of others, two layers of ascii code, one layer of beating hearts,
filter systems and error warnings, country-code after country code inter-
spersed in the midst of unknown ISPs and Netstorms, wanting nothing more
than the loving touch of an arm, weight of a finger against lips, parted,
and 

just about to speak, and silent, and no need to say anything more
