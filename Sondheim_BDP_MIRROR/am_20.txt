A second phenomenology of interest is the _transformation of the ear/
piece-mouth/piece of the instrument itself. These moved from independent
status in earlier telephones, to a _virtual inverted aural head,_ ear
against mouth, mouth against ear, what was originally termed the "French" 
handset. The handset moved from the _cradle_ of the base to the cradle of
the hand and head; speaking became intimate, whispering, as microphony
developed as well. Consider this _telephonic introjection_ as a stage on
the way to VR telephony through stage V above. Current implementations of
Iphone require the use of keyboard, mouse, speakers, and microphone which
may or may not be hand-held; the tasks, in other words, are _distributed._
It is only a matter of time before one speaks, intimately, through and 
against the simulated lips of the other, at a flat and very desirable rate.
