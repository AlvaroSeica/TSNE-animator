depression


walking anywhere, there are scraps of paper, and i wonder about the 
mutilated history of every little thing

every thing cries out its lost name, every paper bag, every twig, every 
discarded note by discarded lovers

things cry out their mines and forests, their roots deep within the earth 
or tethered above it

things have lost their tongues, their eyes; they're present, orphaned, 
invisible, ransacked and raped by the animals that carved them from the 
cradle of the planet

a split-second use of a styrofoam cup, aluminum can, metals and molecules 
twisted and forged, released and hammered into almost total annihilation

and this is depression, too much history, too much longing in the things 
themselves, the world yearning for another, alterity consumed by capital

as we're all consumed by capital, taking even this space of writing for 
granted, infinite presence and infinite resource, text splattered across 
the world in decaying patterns

depression is recognizing the waning, the dying-out, the embers;  depres-
sion is recognizing the death drives as nothing more, nothing less, than 
a slow settling, the local-real trashed, not beyond, but into recognition 

and it's impossible to survive their imaginary cries
