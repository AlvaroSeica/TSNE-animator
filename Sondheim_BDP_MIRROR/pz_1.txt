Images from the Arena opening, Uqbar, Debris Field, Second Life


During the opening the environment constantly changed; objects were given 
weight and dropped. It was oddly symbolic; many of them landed on build- 
ings in the area. Later I reconstructed the chains that went up to the 4k 
level. The number of invisible or phantom objects increased as well. Sandy 
Baldwin performed and added text fragments. One of my avatars performed; 
the other was up in the clouds.

The worse my vision gets (it's bad now), the more the visible becomes a 
sign of hysteria or transference. This landscape appears almost self-gen- 
erating; architecture has long since disappeared or become a remnant of 
something else growing, flooding land and sea and air. It's the old story 
- chaos or mess or messay, life out of control, but everything delibera- 
ted, deliberate, calculating, everything waiting for their day in the 
artificial sun.

Weather, Sync, and Physics in SL


The following have come out of the show in Second Life - 

ian.mp4 is based on Debris Field, the title of the installation - since it 
was near closing, I took out a lot of the elements present and added one 
which was duplicated - this was made for Ian Ah. There are about 100 of 
these; in ian.mp4 the avatar travels through them. What's interesting is 
the way they align themselves into two groups, at either ends of the field 
- and the way the particles from the groups form somewhat random vortices. 
You can see the alignment in sync.mp4 - I removed the particles for this, 
so the objects are clearly visible and divided into two sets of equivalent 
but out of sync motions. I'm fascinated by this - I think the field itself 
must be divided into two different land parcels. So virtual worlds go - 
they're stitched together. The last video, vortices.mp4, maps the weather 
over the regions - particles cross boundaries without changing direction, 
but their initial impulse comes from their parent region. There's a fairly 
complex physics at work here - the vortices are in 3d of course, or 4d 
dynamic objects. In a sense this is a computer modeling of a computer 
modeling - the programmed space made visible by a layer of programmed 
responding particles and particle generators. 

So what emerges? Stitching, vortices, weathers without precipitation or 
effect on 'concrete objects' (i.e. only on particles). In the future, the 
stitching will cover larger and larger areas, precipitation will leave 
floods, wind damage, and destruction in its wake; and grounds will muddy, 
dust bowls will render the virtual land virtually fallow...

Below are some stills from the above as well as others of the elements in 
the debris field, including a few of Julu Twine with different elements as 
well.

Zebulon recording from last night 1/25/09


Here's a recording of the set Myk Freedman (lap steel), Azure Carter 
(voice), and I (acoustic electric, tamburitza, ukulele) did last night at 
Zebulon. The original recording was incredibly noisy - I did what I could 
to sweeten it with CoolEdit. I'm quite happy with the music. In order - 
all accompanied by Myk - 
1 - w/ acoustic electric. This is the worst recorded - string buzz is much 
too noticable. Fast tempo.
2 - w/ Azure, melody and voice, and tamburitza - slow then jump rhythm
3 - w/ ukulele - this needed a contact mike - I was thinking of Henry 
Grimes' percussion along the way.
4 - w/ acoustic electric - high-speed quotes outside potential wells.

That's about it - enjoy - Alan

Forestry in Odyssey and Debris Field interference

"This is a radical transformation of the Odyssey installation from the 
Debris Field installation." (below)

These worlds don't stave off death. Nothing does. Not a single word. I 
feel like a relic playing with ESP-Disk, 'one of the original recording 
artists.' I should fumble around on my instrument, cough a lot. I should 
have stories to tell and talk about friends I miss. I should say I know 
I'm too old to take up another instrument or learn Japanese for example or 
even travel. I should say traveling exhausts me. I should be grateful for 
the chance to play in public again. For the chance to play. A chance for 
young people to see what I do. A chance to say I still have my chops. I 
should putter around the stage and smile and thank all you good folks. You 
good folks out there. 

These worlds stave off nothing. My truth is banal: if I cease to innovate 
or somehow in my book, if not yours, cease to be culturally relevant, 
cease to be relevant, begin to become a case, 'the case of' - I should be 
done away with; if I cease to wonder, if I dwell too much on death and 
'earth to earth' (and I am close to that), I should be anesthetized, put 
out of my misery.

Words stave off nothing. There are no books to burn; there are books to 
burn but theory lies in ashes; I fumble for readers - if you're reading 
this, you're probably unique - for publishers - nothing of the sort, not 
that chap again, too much online, save the trees - the petrochemical 
industry - for someone else. His works are vacuous - he can't learn 
another language - he can't even speak Japanese - sooner or later he'll 
drop that guitar - his vision's blurred, he won't be able to find it - you 
can see he's withdrawing - down a potential well - there's no way out - 
there's not the energy to get out - he's fumbling down there - he thinks 
he has an audience - he's playing something or other - we can't hear him - 
he's deaf as well - did you know he recorded for ESP way back then - 
amazing he's still alive - still around - wonder what he thinks of them 
now - don't bother asking - he'll stumble around an answer - mumbles a 
lot, you can't always hear what he's saying.

Of misery, put him out.
Of insomnia, give him sleep.
Of dead friends, give him nothing.
Of Japanese, sayonara.
Of Second Life, too much of the first.
Of life, stupidity in the second.

You can make whole worlds come crashing down, you can make them physical, 
you can dream they come from the screen, out of the screen - they're 
coming for you - whirring too fast, once they're made you can't do 
anything about them, they're too quick for you - you can shut the whole 
thing down, return everything, nothing but manifolds there were, nothing 
but singularities and trajectories were there, nothing but point sets 
there were, nothing but patching were there, nothing but stitching there 
were, nothing but words were there.

This is a radical transformation of the Odyssey installation from the 
Debris Field installation. Do go to the Odyssey site if you can; check out 
the pngs below as well. The Odyssey site:

These are some sort of transformation, these are some kind of change, 
these are a waste of time, these are hypnagogic, hallucinatory, mesmeric, 
oneiric, these are manufactured beauty, these are a collaboration between 
Louise Brooks and Hedy Lamarr, they call them false images or codes.

I fumble for the codes, kludge the codes, I hold worlds in my hands, I 
produce nothing, I produce nothing.

Fumbled worlds in my hands, I produce nothing.


Hello me! 

Hello me! not I, the Understand Man! That familiar you! This letter has 
you!  But your minutes change. Read it, life!  Perhaps my will first. Be 
present, old. My name live is in Marina. Kanash never was married. Have 
carried beauty, for watching, loving man, in evening. Saw 30000 Russia 
men, 000 women, such women! Expensively solved, happy relation-love! 
Family gave from country. data woman. Photo appearance would completely 
begin relations. look only once! Precisely me! Don't friend, it ready 
serious love, relations. Give MAN fragile person. You on turned, out, 
define woman. Answer pleasant, let lonely know.

The Newborn Age

http://www.alansondheim.org/ back jpgs

another masque for Alan Dojoji aka Aylan Dojoji aka Julu Twine; hir body 
switched back to female (during performance), hir prosthesis switched back 
to male. It's an uncomfortable image; a close friend in Brooklyn has 
cancer now and this figure (in the sense of trope) appears to carry, not 
sexuality, but death upon hir. It must be seen that the entire avatar is 
prosthetic, that it breaks down into prosthetic and malleable parts, that 
many of the parts are detachable, and in fact, that many of the parts are 
detached. I do not dream of hir but dream through hir; as transitional 
object, s/he returns the repressed into furious transformations of the 
landscape - furious in the sense of quickly thrown up, in spite of their 
complexity. You go in now and it's different than yesterday, you go in 
tomorrow and it's different than today. As fetish-object, avatar and hir 
space. S/he wears the space like s/pace, like cloth, action-cloth, flex- 
bile prims (object-units). S/he's about the only identifiable element in 
place. Literally s/he channels the show, pointing towards a place in 
s/pace or thing - then adding, subtracting, distending, wryting, wrything, 
among new or old objects until everything appears to gleam again or 
respond in sullen misery. Kristevan semiology, grammar of tropes and 
tropic grammar, s/he moves among the concretization of theory, stopping 
here for a moment for a slim series of portrait-images on the ground, 
beneath the surface of the sea, in the sky - in Second Life, it makes no 
difference. S/he is always already newborn, refreshed at 60 hz, redrawn by 
a distant machinic tended by sysadmins who never came close to hir image, 
hir presence or coordinates, hir history, what s/he has accomplished as if 
by hirself in an untoward or contrary manner.

Meanwhile closer to earth, Linux Journal has an article on SL and open 
source, really elementary, but next issue promises more. I bring this up 
only because of its description of SL art, which is similar to other 
descriptions, and almost always refers to the surrealist/dadaist juxta- 
position of objects and movements, bordering on fantasies. What about 
this? Only that artists who are doing truly original work in SL - Gaz for 
example - are ignored, while art seems to have shifted into fairy-tales. I 
would love to see something in the more or less popular press about the 
radical _alterity_ of Second Life - the ability to create ab nihilo so to 
speak, not even from the ground up. The epistemology of the world itself 
can be questioned, as well as s/paces and places almost inconceivable, 
even as dreamwork, elsewhere. Enough with wings and sparkles!



Sleep study with dream and avatar of six hours' duration


During the study I had a dream of sensors and wires, blood-red, falling 
and failing. I floundered, foundered. I failed, faltered. A somewhat 
reading-study (momentum, center-of-mass) evening. Images during sensor 
attachment, and at the beginning of one of the wake-up periods, the reason 
I'm there in the first place. This was just after an afternoon of wearing 
Gaz' avatar-skin in the OpenSim SL alternative open-source space where I 
ended up surrounded by deep aqua-marine, a perfect space of color. 

When I stirred, I'd go back to reading Baez, A Universal History of the 
Destruction of Books.

I BELIEVE Julu Twine MOVED in OpenSim and Alan Dojoji MOVED in Second 
Life, in exact and specific COORDINATION with the OUTPUT from the ON-BOARD 
sensors, which, in fact, totaled 1000 pages.

I BELIEVE in SELF-MOVEMENT and AUTOMATIC WRYTING as evident HERE:

http://www.alansondheim.org/avatarsleep.mov


un-becoming-Gaz

inconceivable, but Julu Twine gives it a try in OpenSim thanks to Gaz' 
celebration of OpenSim anniversary with an avatar give-away, so here a 
dance celebration - http://www.alansondheim.org/transjulugaz.mp4 - she 
grows on you; needless to say Gaz and hir works are amazing.

"When I am this tired, that's what I look for, erosion at the edges."

I didn't realize until I saw these, how exhausted I've been, how dream and 
non-dream merge how virtual and real collapse into one another; there are 
signs everywhere. [...] [ ... ]

[12:21]  Alan Dojoji: There are two different land parcels here - each has 
its own weather
[12:21]  Alan Dojoji: so you get two different particle flows, storm fkiws
[12:21]  Alan Dojoji: storm flows
[12:22]  Alan Dojoji: The texture at the very end is different with 
different physics
[12:22]  Alan Dojoji: it's at the end of a stationary platform
[12:22]  Alan Dojoji: These squares revolve much faster than any raster so

[12:23]  Alan Dojoji: You should to be able to walk out on it
[12:24]  Alan Dojoji: The spheres generate these things - they're 
miniature reductions of the 40x40x40m spheres in the other show
[12:24]  Alan Dojoji: the blue textures were made here
[12:25]  Alan Dojoji: You can actually walk out on the rotation elements.
[12:26]  Alan Dojoji: The weather stuff fascinates me - from above you can
