this might sound arrogant, but i always write for an audience
the writing has to tear me apart however
but there is someone unknown on the other end
to whom this tearing will have some sort of meaning

so that i would tend say to step out as far as i can on an edge or
perimeter
not to be caught on the other end
but to loop through the wonder
which can only occur if something new is also occurring
and that means the complicity of at least a potential reader or audience

otherwise i'm kidding myself
my beautiful work, etc.
my incredible intelligence, etc.
this is the best thing ever, etc.

even when there's no audience, there's always another book, another
seduction, another text
reading them steels me, prepares me
alan, you're an idiot, see what x or y says
alan, you've never read z before - and you don't know what you're talking
about

i need these voices
otherwise it's all a masquerade
as opposed to the masquerade of 'emanations' i can write from or into
as opposed to the masquerade of pushing myself to the limits

so paradoxically the readings keep me honest
i don't fool myself
i can tread out as far as possible on the ledge and know
that maybe it's an @ledge and i'll just fall into another text
or maybe there's more at stake
but it keeps me going
