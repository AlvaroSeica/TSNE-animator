i'm incapable of saying anything authoritative. stemming from an inability
ever to best my father when growing up. he always had to have the last
word. in. i never believe what i'm saying or writing or about to say. that
gives me no followers, no credence, and a skeptical, overly critical, and
dubious attitude towards the world at large. (did i say that?) if i coin a
neologism, i accompany it with a sense of shame; why couldn't i express
myself more clearly. my work is filled with far too many irrelevant refer-
ences (unlike, say, the work of Wittgenstein), giving the text a sense of
legitimation which is often nothing more than a masquerade.

This is me, Jennifer, writing you, from everywhere in this large world.
Do you read me, world? Do you want me, world?
If you, world, do not answer, I will kill myself.
Honestly, I will kill myself. Do not doubt I will do this very thing.
Now I will send the dismissile and the dismissive and I will wait.
I will wait for an answer and I will decide what to do.
I, Jennifer, will do what I will do. I will be missived. I will misbehave.

i'm at a loss for words. i'm hideously ugly. i can't go out in the day. i
can't show myself at night. i avoid nightclubs. i avoid people. so in all
these senses, i'm ideal canon fodder for online culture, this skittered
orality, a culture constantly transforming down to the very bit and byte -
a letter that is here, now, may be gone tomorrow. i don't have to own up
to anything. i can write the way others breathe. i don't have any choice.
everything exacts too high a toll. i don't have to see anyone ever. i
don't have to be anyone at all. i can hardly write this. i can hardly
think, it's so hard to think. this letter is gone tomorrow. i can hardly
think.
