I wrestled the goddamned angel to the ground. The angel just watched me
from a pillow while I slept. I kept going up and down the stairs. I was a
boy a girl, I didn't have pubic hair. The angel was damned, damn-mad, be-
cause he had to lose. I'd kill to get that text right. It didn't matter at
all in the breadth of a stain on a minor planet. But I made the angel fuck
me over and over again and then I fucked the angel and then I couldn't
tell who did what to whom. That was the very best ever because I was doing
physics. I'd almost get the text right and there it was. It never fit, ne-
ver _like that_ but almost _like that._ It raised its blocky head.
