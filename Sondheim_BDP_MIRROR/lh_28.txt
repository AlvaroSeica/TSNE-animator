video-hole, because wherever you are in the viewfinder, there are you,
taking it, it always comes forth, peels off, is precisely a presence. 
so you can prove you were with me, and everyone watching adds another 
statistic of truth. they are witnesses. they dislike looking but they 
look and they remember but they only see the rest of it, not the hole
itself.

Parable


Nikuko and Izanagi were walking near Lake Biwa. They were discussing the
parables of Nikuko, which were also the parables of Izanagi. He said,
They'll be known by your name, The Parables of Nikuko. She replied, Noth-
ing in this world exists outside of the sign, or everything exists outside
of the sign. If nothing exists outside, these parables will remain forever
in human memory, but if everything exists outside, these parables will
already have been forgotten. That is indeed a sentence, said Izanagi, or a
sentencing. It is only two, said Nikuko, and that is already two too many.
They continued walking around the shore.
