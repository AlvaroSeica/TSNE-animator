Timeout -- while doing something indeterminable.


at last finger no longer brings home the world
but only a murmuring behind thick or walls filled flush
with oozing text: poor Unix has no geomancy
telling among the rocks of this rare earth
what rare earths glow subluminary;
I search and find nothing but something, a something
indeterminable, skittering across protocols and bins,
hungering after permissions and lost directories,
buried within the mining of metals and coals,
tunneled and shored by timbers diffused with light:
at last the finger points; and what bleak source
eludes, dissolves, and steers the Word off course?
