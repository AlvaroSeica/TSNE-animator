thing against the softness of our bodies
 plates and coagulations, rivets, suturings of steel
thing against the wetness of our bodies
 fabrication of dry parts
thing against the sloughing off of skins
 lubrications and channels
thing against our ten holes, nine holes, eight, seven, six
 sealings-off, containments, platters and lids
thing against our flaccid breasts, cocks, lips, weak desires
 chemicals, shamed memories, cloth and iron mesh
thing against the gropings of speech, apologies, and cries
 sounds thrown across glasses, airs, and wires
thing against our weakness
 iron, iron, against our weaknesss, iron
