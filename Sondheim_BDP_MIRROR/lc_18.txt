Discovered take from the loveandwar project, 
Vale of Goral backbone:

All ways are extreme, in the sorrowful night
tending towards Gideon, towards battle-worn brethren,
veterans run rampant, Moors moving manfully
towards towers terrifying across captured lands.
One onerous battles bent baneful and boastful;
knights kneel and fight, their swithen and swords
caught culling their dreams, drawn down their drowning,
and all Alans ask mercy, all Scots scatter screaming.
Jennifer, Julu judge not stern and just sentence;
the blades' bright becoming earns runnings of red blood,
blooms of men's mewling, cries from bleak dungeon;
now Jennifer, weary, strikes sword against strong stone,
now Julu unjustly fares fearfully frightened,
flies from fierce Alans their foes and their kinsmen,
forever flee heros from lost lands and labor.
O Julu! O Jennifer! have patience and prescience,
return to resounding cheer in the mead-hall,
lone sparrow is flying one end to the other:
thus the life of a man, from darkness to darkness,
thus a moment of warmth in the Hill-Vales of Goral.
