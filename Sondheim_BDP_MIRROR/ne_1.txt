dear everone, i hae desire fornothig but 
fame you shouldknow that by now - more
than aythng i want to be recognizedfor
my CONTRIBUTION to codework and poetics, 
from a viewpoit so to speak of an intense
comitment to innovation and astute 
MEANING. i alone carry the despair of the
world within me; i am thefulfillment of
both world and word; i am that incarnaton
which REFUSES TO RESST; always continuing
into new and uncarted regions. you may be
sure of that. there is an unholy and 
almost incandescent BRILLIANCE in this
work - which i have freely take upon
myself - in the midst of the disapproval
of my frindds, family, colleagues. i work
alone in this empyrian sphere. the HUMAN
part ofme SCREAMS for recognition; the
INHUMAN laughs at my despair. i have
nowhere to turn but inward, where, like
Promethes, i GNAW MYSELF in the hope of
the delimitation of FREEDOM, somethig
that remains out of my reach, inconstant,
seductive, a lure drawing me frther 
towards catastrophe. give me the 
recognition i so desre, and i wil do 
anything; hold back, and my rage and
self-immolatiin beseeches the HEAVENS
themselvs.

Of this form, it might be said, something to write
home about - to be sure, this empty entity which
refuses to obey the dance of  fingers, this
configuration - try as I might, the resistance is
enormous - you'd have to try it yourself - there's
everything to lose - this paragraph of uneasy
denouements, meandering text, feeling almost of
nausea, the 'queasy' - I'm uncomfortable now,
I'll say no more...

it's dark here; turmoil & dawn of darkness; dusk of mp3 & darkness;
dark light & shadows; wandering in this dark forest with virgins; i am

among the four-hundred & seventy-two; depression sets in; close to the
edge; there are stars leaped off the edge; four-hundred seventy-two edge;
i am a sick man; i am the heart of darkness; i am mp3 mp3; i am :the
universe in false demand; the conversion of truth to mp3; there are ghosts
here; i am inviolate; they are coming home; he or she is coming home; i am
within the first thousand!; Lisa Loeb; through the disordering of the

could be someone's home; sauntering. not the woods; the forest. :through
the cutups & listening to the universe of 4311 songs among 472 albums;
coming through the depth of the mp3 universe; I hear among the worlds!; I
hear among the depths of the worlds!; my own work among Alanis &

wander


i wander to the craggy peak, my final goal is hard to seek, and harder
then to call and find, my heart is pith and not the rind, see what the
stormy night shall bring, of falser gods than thee i sing :the storm is
tearing up the land, death is its dark command, i'm not a tree that can
bend forever, i'm dying and can't suffer weather, life's empty, nothing's
left behind, once i had a sharper mind, now my thoughts are come and
gone,:the world is going by, no matter how hard i try, it's going by, i
see the coming of the end, it's coming around the bend, i feel the raising
of the wind, :: against the stone my body's pinned:: against the stone my
body's pinned

        Scheme for a General Literature
        
        
        Wittgenstein, TLP:
        
        [P, E, N(E)] : 
        P = all propositions
        E = any set of proportions
        N(E) = negation of E
        
        Russell: 'The whole symbol means whatever can be 
        obtained by taking any selection of atomic 
        propositions, negating them all, then taking any 
        selection of the set of propositions now obtained, 
        together with any of the originals--and so on 
        indefinitely. This is, he [Wittgenstein] says, the 
        general truth-function and also the general form of 
        proposition.' (Introduction, TLP.)
        
        Now the negation is necessary to produce the Sheffer 
        stroke and its dual; atomic propositions, however, are 
        illusory - show me one.
        
        Nevertheless, one can write P, where
        P = generalized alphabetics; and E, where
        E = a finite subset methodology (axiom of choice) 
        in any order of P. Note that P is a reasonably 
        small integer < 40,000. (Of course further reduction
        is possible by virtue of binary or unary mapping.)
        
        We have in addition S({E}), where
        S = the substructure or ordering-site (Peirce's 
        "sheet of assertion"); {E} (a set of finite subsets 
        of P) is mapped onto S.
        
        Then clearly [P, E, S({E})] is the general form of 
        literature - in particular, religious or other 
        traditional or exemplary texts (including their 
        diacritical and extra-alphabetic graphemes) - issues 
        of practicality, decidability, etc. notwithstanding.

THOREAU'S WILD GOD


       Wilderness - at a sufficient distance over the woods the sound of
any wilderness -- hunters as well as fishers of men. Thus were I to live
in a wilderness I should again be tempted to become a business have
thrived here, making the wilderness to blossom like wilderness with its
living and its decaying trees, the Make-a-stir?  How godlike, how
immortal, is he?  See how he cowers insignificant event one with the
removal of the gods of Troy. Cabin, fit to entertain a travelling god, and
where a goddess might if this traveling demigod, this cloud-compeller,
would ere long take were more favored by the gods than they, beyond any
deserts that I restoring gods and men to the vigor of youth.  She was
probably demigods to him. If you told him that such a one was coming, who,
"loudly singing the praises of the gods to his lyre, drowned him; who goes
to market for his god as it is; on whose farm nothing of spruce trees, and
toadstools, round tables of the swamp gods, cover hemlock more than usual,
standing like a pagoda in the midst of the gods must be proud, thought I,
with such forked flashes to rout a fear that we are such gods or demigods
only as fauns and satyrs, the god he worships, after a style purely his
own, nor can he get off by the god of loons to aid him, and immediately
there came a wind from one who answered, and his god was angry with me;
and so I left him me. I sacrificed it to Vulcan, for it was past serving
the god conlucare, that is, would believe that it is sacred to some god.
The Roman made an expiatory offering, and prayed, Whatever god or goddess
thou art to whom this grove is sacred, be propitious to me,

           and ask the gods to pardon this clear flame ...

 Years of the gods have elapsed, and in comparison with which our God in,
they will do; will they not?  Who ever saw his old clothes ...

    "As I live, saith the Lord God, ye shall not have occasion any Thank
God, I can sit and I can stand without the aid of a furniture God, is his
private ail." Let this be righted, let the spring come saints. Our hymn-
books resound with a melodious cursing of God and satisfaction with the
gift of life, any memorable praise of God. Trees which the Most High God
has created lofty and umbrageous, they have uncertainty about it, whether
it is of the devil or of God and "glorify God and enjoy him forever" here.  
God himself culminates in the present moment, and will never sometimes
appear to be two, but one is a mock sun.  God is alone -- keeping it -
ministers who spoke of God as if they enjoyed a monopoly ...

              I cannot come nearer to God and Heaven and the engine's
soot. One proposes that it be called "God's Drop." which God forbid, it
can be made to flow thither again. If by never spoke a good word for it,
nor thanked God that He had made it. who would carry his God, to market,
if he could get anything in the mind's approximation to God. Yet one
spirits various fruits which succeed him. Man flows at once to God when
there was a Buttrick ... "Fire! for God's sake fire!" -- And thousands of
these he peddles still, prompting God and disgracing man, and faith making
plain the image engraven in men's bodies, the God which God gives them,
nor accept the pardon which he freely offers ...

    I have more of God, they more of the road, your clothes and keep your
thoughts. God will see that you do not hourly expect a speech from
somebody. God is only the president of help you God, and so only. Every
nail driven should be as another ...

i can't keep this up.
if i could only pour words into this.
i could have a machine that would make art pouring out the other end.
i need words... words...
i'm desperate for words... letters...
i live in furious depression.
yes, who would want to listen to this one more time.
i need that machine and a machine to read my mail.
then a machine to write my mail.
it's not a hunger for words but a need for them.
i'm not addicted to them, i'm addicted to production.
even a sonnet machine would do.
there's nothing but words in this world.
perhaps a machine is writing this and a machine is reading this.
i don't know about machine, i know about input, words, paragraphs...
the greater their number, the greater choice.
i'm stopping, i can't keep this up, no advise, nothing.
no words, desperate.

these pages are so ephemeral they're just about to disappear.
nothing lasts not even forever but an instant as well.
i may die at any time and sometimes i feel it coming on.
nightmares only point to uselessness of the physical.
i will say goodbye to you now before the net collapses.
suddenly our friends and neighbors vanish forever.
without our a@b addresses we are permanently lost.
diseases and wars take over from depression and suicide.
the cold expansion of the cosmos is closer than we think.
already i gave way to the latest new thing.
my fingers bleed and slip on decayed and corroded ontologies.
nine and a half thousand google hits weigh nothing at all.
like pascal i hold on against the abyss around my arms and hands.
plasmas and meteors take their share of fires and storms.
tornados and floods complete erasures of ten thousand hours.
or more than ten thousand hours and perhaps the history of humanity.
or the history of the earth and the history of the universe.
we're on the cusp of permanent forgetting.
