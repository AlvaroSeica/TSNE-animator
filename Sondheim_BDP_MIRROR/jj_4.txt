Perth(0), unto, untoward

This is like a dream. So clearly a moment already passed. Back in New York
seeming. As if everything had never happened. Except for the presence of a
single small object. Perhaps in the pocket or carried. As a remainder or
surplus. So thisis a fantastic. Interlude of philosophy. Already missed or
passed. Present as a moment within. The history of philosophy. The history
of thought. Of thinking. If I am alive, I am philosophy unto its death; if
I am in Perth, I am in philosophy's Perth, and there is none beyond.
