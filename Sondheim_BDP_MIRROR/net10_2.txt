SPEECH AND COMPUTATIONAL LIMITS


The program below is an extremely simple investigation of the formula
y = sin(cot x), with a 'minor' addition. First, note that the value of
y ranges from +1 to -1, since sin(f(x)), whatever f(x), is limited. 
Second, note that cot x tends to +/- infinity at x = 0; therefore the
formula implies a "speed-up" of frequency near 0. And third, note that
within classical trigonometry, this function is analog with a periodic
singularity. To _plot_ this equation is to take incremental values of
x, calculate y, and plot (x,y). (Note by the way that cos(x)/sin(x) is
equivalent to cot(x) which is not immediately available in qbasic.)

The _complexity_ of the program occurs through the _second_ term of
the formula, - k*y. (In ordinary mathematics, the formula would be
written y = sin(cot x) - ky.) Here k is a constant between -1 and 1;
outside the bandwidth, the equation overflows. What does the second
term say?

It indicates that _every time_ y is calculated, the previous value of
y times a constant is subtracted from the formula. If the first term
is analog, i.e. functioning continuously with the exception of periodic
points, the second term is _discrete_ and dependent upon, not only k,
but also: 1. -a (i.e. the initial value of x) and 2. z (the increment
of x). Both a and z are _arbitrarily_ chosen by the user; each choice
completely determines a different graphic result - such results not
necessarily transforming one into another.* In other words, a _discrete_
system imposed on an _analog_ system here fails to have any "natural
mapping," it would seem; the class of all such maps notwithstanding.
Suppose, for example, z was infinitesimal; then the graph would remain
constant, at x = -a. 

What is the point of all of this? Within the realm of relatively simple
mathematics, we are creating a _broken structure,_ dependent on user's
choice. The choosing can be considered a _form of interference_ - which
is readily apparent if k = 0. Remembering Heisenberg or Schroedinger's
cat, it seems germane to ask:

Is speaking always a form of distortion?

DEFDBL x
home: y = 0: CLS :
INPUT "Screen +/-x, +/-y, k for ky, k<1"; a, b, k
PRINT "Hit r for restart"
INPUT "Enter x increment, usually between .001 and 1"; z
CLS : SCREEN 11: WINDOW (-a, b)-(a, -b)
LINE (-a, 0)-(a, 0): LINE (0, b)-(0, -b)
x = -a
two:
y = SIN(COS(x) / SIN(x)) - k * y
PSET (x, y)
IF INKEY$ = "r" THEN GOTO home
x = x + z
GOTO two


*At certain values, the graph appears to become chaotic.
