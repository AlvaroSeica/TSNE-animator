and letters


letters fall over and lie there as well. 
if this had been a book, you would have read this long ago.
the pages, yours, letters swollen, loving your mouth.
the grist of letters among protrusions of the flesh.

all letters sing only of sex and death.
love appears along their splines or embrochures.
it is the ancient science of letters.
never confuse this with material or spiritual wealth.

letters survive and murmur and couple and mourn.
letters need nothing, not even our speaking and writing.
the page is a trap is a cemetery is a constant death.
letters burn black fire white smoke in sullen truths of skies.

what we see is their death, what we know, their death.
nothing of their song or the spike of them in tongue.
your mouth gets in the way, they don't want to leave.
our lives are seduced by each and every page.

letters, leave us.
letters, leave us.
