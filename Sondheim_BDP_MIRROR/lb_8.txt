BIG SONG


Sidonius, trans. Sondheim, Ad V. C. Catvllinvm:

"Why, even if I could, do you bid me to compose a song to Diones, the
lover of Fescennine jubilation, since I'm living among long-haird hordes
and having to listen to German verbiage, praising often with a wry face
the song of the gluttonous Burgundian who spreads rancid butter on his
hair? Should I tell you what wrecks poems? Spewed out by barbarian wail-
ing, Thalia's spurned the six-foot style ever since she's seen these
seven-foot patrons."

Continued trans. Anderson:

"I am fain to call your eyes and ears happy, happy too your nose, for you
don't have a reek of garlic and foul onions discharged upon you at early
morn from ten breakfasts, and you are not invaded even before dawn, like
an old grandfater or a foster-father, by a crowd of giants so many and so
big that not even the kitchen of Alcinous could support them.

"But already my Muse is silent and draws reign after only a few jesting
hendecasyllables, lest anyone should call even these lines satire."


 Quid me, etsi valcam, parare carmen / Fescenninicolae iubes Diones /
inter crinigeras situm catervas / et Germanica verba sustinentem, /
laudantem tetrico subinde vultu / quod Burgundio cantat esculentus, /
infundens acido comam butyro? / vis dicam tibi, quid poema frangat? /
ex hoc barbaricis abacta plectris / spermit senipedem stilum Thalia, /
ex quo septipedes videt patronos. / felices oculos tuos et aures /
felicemque libet vocare nasum, / cui non allia sordidumque cepe /
ructant mane novo decem apparatus / quem non ut vetulum patris parentem /
nutricisque virum die nec orto / tot tantique petunt simul Gigantes, /
quot vix Alcinoi culina ferret. /
 Sed iam Musa tacet tenetque habenas / paucis hendecasyllabis iocata, /
ne quisquam satiram vel hos vocaret.
