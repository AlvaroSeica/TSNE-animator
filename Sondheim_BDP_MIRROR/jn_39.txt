Teaching tonight, I found a number of students did not know what a prompt
was, in any format. This will become more comment.

The _potential_ screen or space implied by 
C:\>
will have been replaced by <a> <b> <c> options, already preconfigured.

Instead of the quasi-programming commands like sed, debug, grep, awk, or
availability of Perl, Qbasic, etc., preconfiguring will function as both
filter and puncture. No longer a body of space or text, computational
space becomes a tangle or hierarchy of links.

As with Network television, this space, pre-constructed, constructs the
subject as well: into consumption, continuous upgrade, format.

And as with all consumption, seduction is critical - using sound, music,
memories of revolution. The space of the Turing machine has disappeared.

The task no longer draws itself forth into the blankness of creative mis-
management; instead, tasks are already enumerated, packaged.

Consider these _packets of (post)modernization,_ (Berger); the effects are
already lost, efface, a deconstruction of sublimation. _It_ scatters.

_They're_ gone.
