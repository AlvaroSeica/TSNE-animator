Lament for the Wolves

for the killing of wolves by helicopter
for the hatred of wolves
lament for the brilliance of wolves

http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/wolveslament.mp3

i cannot write this, can only play it
solo viola, lament for the shooting of wolves


Lament for the Wolves, what i heard and saw

these are what i heard and saw, playing lament for the wolves,
the images are _literal,_ they were _there_ in the music, 
among the music, guiding the music, they were _shaman_ in the
_literal_ sense

the crying and mewling of wolves
howling of wounded and dying wolves
wet flanks of the wolves running everywhere
i was just above them, smell of wet fur
panting of the wolves fleeing for their lives
broken legs and necks, wolves, shot, tumbling
choking for breath of the terrified wolves
roar and sputtering of helicopter blades
sounds of firing and collapsing wolves
cries of the pups and stumbling pups
trampled pups and constant thunder
screaming animals and the loss of life
broken families and slaughtered bodies
blinded and deafened wolves
the brutal melody of death and mourning


ecology and music

http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/hunters.mp3 pipa
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/huntersandgeese.mp3 guitar
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/canadageese.mp3 guitar

hunters and geese, entangled birds, in brooklyn, canada geese were 
recently gassed at prospect park - including one who had been saved, after 
an arrow was found embedded in her. the pipa expresses martial rage; the 
guitar broils, settles down in the last section.

for reasons going back to childhood, fear, depression, regret, guilt, i 
can't deal with suffering; i would cripple buddhism, oblate the terminus. 
azure kept the story from me for a long time. in aurora, outside of 
denver, we watched a story on channel 9 news - with the newscasters 
laughing as a robin repeatedly crashed into the picture window of one of 
their homes, marking up the pane with what one could only assume was lymph 
and blood. an "ornithologist" "explained" the robin wanted the home. no 
one mentioned a simple owl or other bird silhouette on the window would 
have saved the bird from injury. it was horrifying. aurora's where the 
prairie dogs were gassed. in any case, this image - of the robin - 
imprinted itself on me; it's burned in, adds to misery. (robins by the way 
are amazing; we saw one in the middle of an alpine lake in the wasatch. 
they live up into the middle of alaska, smart birds.)

another element - going for a colonoscopy tomorrow so haven't eaten all 
day and the music happened in a world of spaciness, close to fainting. i 
suppose shots fired in the imaginary helped with the broiling. i played 
carelessly but accurately, at least as well as i can tell in my condition.

bushmeat

bushmeat, what we do to animals
what our rhetoric does to humans to animals
what animals suffer (rhetoric, humans)
what humans suffer (humans, rhetoric)
speech is a violation
speech is slaughter
the imminence of speech: annihilation to the limit
the immanence of speech: limitless annihilation
bushmeat: everyone disappears
permanence of disappearance
an animal is a human
talk goes on and on precisely the same
talk is slaughter
listen to me, i will kill you
deaf and dead you: i will kill you 
i will devour you your bones
bushmeat, dead with the death of the last animal
with the last you, bushmeat gone with your death

don't stop now

when the guns come
salute the stupid people
open the mouths of the animals
open the mouths of the mouths
salute those who salute you
salute you stupid animals

if you sing we shoot faster
if you don't sing we shoot slower
die you stupid animals

Law's occultation

Law's occultation, outlawed in this sanctuary, and i confess occultation: 
in this part of the sanctuary, the names of gods, scape-goating, speaking 
the planet, ossuaries, stases, and defending oneself, watching slowly, the 
release of the hawk, the forms of the dead, soft, egg-like, yellowed, the 
color of Law's occultation

the testimony they had given; they cried out with a loud body, presencing, 
following, excessive. across the internet, Julu testimonies, Jennifer 
testimonies; nothing is sacred, i am pariah, sanctuary, in my skin and 
avatar, look for avatar. the testimony of schizophrenia: _they eat and are 
eaten._ [...] and hands, painlessly, but extrinsic, unable to testify. no 
testimony, no sanctuary, stillborn, mourning, submitting hir statement, 
Jennifer's, in the ossuary of the other, the mechanical.
		    o courteous trimmed testimonies,
far ossuaries in the scientific city and its sepulchers.

heidegger no kant honestly flickers through a tired eye as the debris 
after menses or semen. Body in idle chatter, flickering through random 
receptors, temporary or peripheral organism of the LCD green-screen, 
organic plasma reassembled in your water. Purified, you cradle me; I 
flicker female sleeping in the corner. Winds howl; flames make eerie 
scales, fire, long tongues spell kanji-shapes in and out of the neural, 
lists of sexual graphemes and net sex, bodies in and out of this world, 
between suns and moons

between God-calls, falling pebble sounds, flickering bodies swelling stuff 
broke. from outer space there must have been a flicker, miasma, surfeit of 
shapes, margins, exiles. Because of the flickering of addresses, red in 
the vaporous clouds that rose among the storms, electric currents in the 
neon wilderness, I hear you Nikuko. Our skin pales beneath flickering 
flourescents, jaundiced incandescents. with flickering and competitive 
protocols. There are no rooms left for the sleeping

for the memory of you, time fashions against the desert sky, blue-black 
bodies in some other space. identity arises in the flicker, which has a 
number, the number of the object, almost there, but not quite, forgotten 
among dead-desire machines. The candle flickers while he strangles his 
mother, and the other candle flickers when he stabs his father, read 
Lacan

where always something seemed to be flickering and shimmering, a darkness 
with flickering and competitive protocols. There are no rooms left for the 
one, like nuclei floating in vacuo, of no goddesses, my body flickering in 
and out and I'm ashamed (the system falters), And radical disconnects 
fragment day and night after night and day to pirouette for him. THERE ARE 
NO ROOMS LEFT FOR THE DEAD.

wax's huge flickering candle's light. she said, I will say these poems' 
she imagines her womb flickering with text pouring around it she imagines 
stuff broke. from outer space there must have been a flicker. think filled 
with water. She spat it out of this world, flickering between the picked 
poem's book, incandescent wax's huge flickering candle's light. flicker on 
unplastered wall - wildly movement, the woman caught, the flickering of 
screens - silk, not celluloid - to similar other wars reduced to mute and 
brutal silence as screens flicker out and others other as wars screens 
died before they were born: NO ROOMS LEFT FOR THE DEAD ALREADY STILL-BORN, 
ABSENT.

dark working sky, the lights sky, flickering lights towers, the people 
dark across the sky, lights flickering in the towers, people working. 
That's my role of thinking. Deities flicker on the lip-nub of death. The 
jumble begins to take advantage of screen resolution and frame/flicker 
recognition. I found myself having difficulties with flicker phenomena as 
I am lost in miasma, too many shapes, my eyes take or spew barely in 
control. ALREADY GONE.

or they're just a flicker in hir imagination.

capit

each takes the head of the others, each capitulates to the others,
each recapitulates the others, each is reminiscent of the others
of themselves
of their head outside themselves
of an unobtainable heading
of heading towards reminiscence
of never quite achieving reminiscence
of each other 
of the head of the other outside itself
of the unobtained, incontrovertible, wayward, contrary, fused
