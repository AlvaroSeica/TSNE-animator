NIGHT. _MY DINNER WITH ANDRE:_





Wally:



If I understand it correctly, I think Heidegger said that if you were

to experience your own being to the full, you would be experiencing

the decay of that being toward death as part of your experience.



Andre':



Yes. You know, in the sexual act there's that moment of complete 

forgetting which is so incredible, and in the next moment you start

to think about things - work on the play, what you've got to do

tomorrow. I don't know if this is true of you, but I think it must

be quite common. The world comes in quite fast. Now, that may be

because we don't have the courage to stay in that place of forgetting,

because that is again close to death. Like people who are afraid to

go to sleep. [...]
