Hi - Need help! I'm giving a panel talk at the Hastac Conference in 
Toronto, at the end of April; my proposal was as follows -

"I'd like to do a full talk, dealing with What is to be Done, with issues
of animal and plant extinctions, with degrees of hopelessness, with the
mass Permian extinction, with images of escape in Second Life and
elsewhere, with the damnation of technophilia and Google Glasses. I would
talk from notes and project, not read a paper (I never write papers to
read), but could turn the notes in later of course. This is a theme I've
been harping on more and more - how to deal with absolute despair and the
despair of the absolute."

I've written out (most of) an outline below, and would appreciate any
comments you might have. I realize my naivete in relation to the subject,
and I'm trying to get away from just "gut feelings" and say something
useful, with some sort of clarity. Please send me any thoughts; you can
write me back-channel (what an old expression!) and thanks,

- Alan
