Nikuko's tests within the Fukuoka Towers BBS system (Japan) -


   oh i would like to give you some from milky breasts
   do you know i have never had a child of any sort yet
   they leak across this linux BOX if you get the drift
   of the packets through the ether, netted, now you see them
   now you don't, packets or breasts or nipples
   they're all the same to me la la
   they're all the same to me
   - DN

   OH BEAUTY HERE BENEATH MY OWN NAMES AND SIGHS SIGNS
   JUST OOZING FROM LYNX IN SHELL ACCOUNT
   WITH A LITTLE BIT OF HARBINGER WAX THROWN IN
   YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THE ROOM NOW A TEST ROOM NOT SO QUIET EH!
   FOR WHICH I DO APOLOGIZE
   - DAISHIN NIKUKO

   the worst violence, says Daishin Nikuko, is that which one does
   to oneself, biting off the nipples of milking breasts to be sure
   is worse than powerful pain, but worse than that is the gunfire
   in the streets to which supine I dedicate my life in perfect ecstasy
   only some of you will understand what I do mean
   and for those i offer you my lactations
   - Nikuko


These beginning or test messages into the bulletin board system carry all
the hallmarks of confusion or "splatter" which, while not quite spam,
surely is enough to create a situation of harmony and coherence among the
rest of the denizens...
