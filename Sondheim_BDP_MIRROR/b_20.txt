 





My Paper "Absolut"





"Absolut" refers both to vodka and the things we buy and sell when we are 

operating under the fact that we need money to do the things we buy. I 

love vodka and all forms of drink and thought it would be wonderful to 

see the land where Mr. Kruschev (sp.!!!) comes from where there was so 

much thinking about this and later the war which is just like our War 

Between the States to keep Chechenve (sp.!!!!) so that Russia can keep 

her church. And I thought that Mr. Pascal had the write idea as well 

because he says that submission is cool because there's always someone 

who knows more than you do, and who knows who that someone could be! So I 

thought that was cool and just perfect.



And because I use computers (I play Doom and Myst is great too but you 

have to think too much) that old book on cybernetics really showed how 

the Russians could just see the whole world as information reflected in 

every piece of matter, just as when I smile my teeth light up the 

computer screen because it's black (I could never figure out windows!!!). 

I guess like Blake says the whole world is reflected in a piece of sand 

in front of a mirror (it's in his Flowers of Evil I think but I don't 

read French!!!!!!!), so the Russians found this out really late. And it 

was great to make a whole paper without even ONE word that I WROTE 

(underline! underline!!!) because they were all things someone else had 

said! So guess what I submitted to THEIR THOUGHTS! And they REFLECTED 

WHAT I WAS THINKING! And I hope they win their war to free Chechchenene 

(sp.!!!) because the Russians know what's best!!! (Well they do now 

because all the COMMUNISTS have left and stuff!!!!!!!!!!!!)
