I have been working on an outline for an Internet course that will deal 
with issues ranging from technical to theoretical. I am giving eleven 
lectures of two hours each. The outline, which is quite extensive, is 
below; I think it may be useful, given the range of materials covered.

EXTENDED OUTLINE: 

This is a guide to all of the material that would be covered in the 
course, either in outline form or in detail. I presuppose no prior 
knowledge of the Internet. The main book is Harley Hahn, The Internet 
Complete Reference, Second Edition, Osborne.
