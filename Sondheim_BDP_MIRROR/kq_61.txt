ay, how would you describe me? you'd take a moment and look at
me, maybe when you log on or through the .w command and that
would excite you! more, you'd always ask for, beg for; nearing
the end, you might run an .examine julu, just to see what would
come up. i'd be waiting for something about warm pulsating walls
or rather i'd be waiting for someone in warm pulsating walls,
hoping for the concrete before the conclusion initiated by the
presence of a single or singular dot, isolated on a line by it-
self, hovered in the silence of a perfect conclusion. now you
know i am lingering about, waiting to see what you make of my
perfect description. you will want me and you will search my
name, hungering for more and more, writing me as you realize
that you and i were made for each other. it is a long way home
from there, but you and i know the way.
