Doctor Leopold Konninger


Doctor Leopold Konninger says to Nikuko: We understand each other
perfectly.

Nikuko smiles. She has heard so much about the doctor. She says: You are
mine for the evening, doctor. I will dance for you and no one else.

The doctor wears thick pince-nez. He wears a black top-hat. He carries 
a cane. The doctor is silent. His eyes glitter.

Nikuko says: But you must do one thing for me doctor.

The doctor is silent. He is waiting. Waiting gives him an advantage.
Nikuko says: You must remove your clothing. You must remove your 
eye-glasses. Who watches me is also watched.

The doctor is silent. Nikuko continues: I will wear my tutu. It is 
embroidered with the flags of all the European nations. I will create 
a free and independent Europe. My entrechat speaks eloquently of free 
and sovereign states. My cabriole carries happiness to the skies.

The doctor is silent. He does not know what to think. Nikuko begins to
dance. The doctor removes his pince-nez. The doctor puts down his cane.
