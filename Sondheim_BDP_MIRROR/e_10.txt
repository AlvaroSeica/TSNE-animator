third sex


he had these dreams where he would lay naked with the hogs. he wouldn't 
tell anyone about them. hed hold the door of the pen open wide. the 
scuffling sounded like his body. he could feel blank eyes staring at him. 
he was on his back was lower than they were. hed hear their snuffling in 
his dreams. hed wake up with his fingers in him imagining. he never knew 
what a dream was. once there was no once. he dreamed that it stayed like 
his cousin stayed. she was thirteen and she stayed. he said to himself 
was used to it.

the pen was near the flat joint to the hill. they grew peaches up there 
and he would open his mouth wide on the trees. he could never open it 
wide enough. his tongue would crawl with it.

there was a stream and he thought there might be something to wash off 
but there wasnt.

she lay down in the water with her white dress on.
she lay down in the water with her thin white dress on.
she could see through the sweet dress.
she thought of bees humming all around, she thought about flowers.
she made a vow made the solemnest vow ever.
she closed her eyes and saw through her bones and there were eyes through 
her bones.

once there was no one.
