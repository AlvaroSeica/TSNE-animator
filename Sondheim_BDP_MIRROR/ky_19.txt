my deep question

oh how do you continue to live -
oh i have lived in so many places, so many partners -
oh i have worked in so many places, so many bosses -
i have married and married and married and married 
and divorced and divorced and divorced and divorced and 
and and i continue to live, i know tomorrow i will wake up
and at two o'clock in the afternoon i will continue to live -
later, at seven in the evening, i will continue to live, 
and all into the next day, i would bet on it, continue to live -
sometimes when i continue to live, i think to myself, here
i am and i continue to live, or i will nap, fall into a
deep sleep, many dreams and adventures, i will wake up and
think, here i am, i continue to live, or while i am dreaming
as well, 'look at me, i continue to live' -
i'll eat, too, excrete, read a book, have sex, shop, go to the 
movies, i am looking at the movies and i continue to live -
there are so many things to think about and write down -
i will write down all these things and think about them -
i will continue to live while i think and write -
there are times i'll have something to drink or "just taste" -
god bless you all, good night
