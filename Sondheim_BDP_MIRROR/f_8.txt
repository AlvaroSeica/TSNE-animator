artificial life and the violated envelope of the body





i can't touch the life on the screen.

the life on the screen can touch the life on the screen.

if i kill the life on the screen it doesn't know what happened.

if the life on the screen kills the life on the screen, memory 

and history begin, and so do the remnants of the monumental.

the life on the screen is propelled by fate which exists outside

the bandwidth of its self-defining.

the life on the screen develops frameworks for fate, speeding up

the development of culture.

the life on the screen can laugh, tickle itself, the life on the

screen can touch.

gods have no hands.
