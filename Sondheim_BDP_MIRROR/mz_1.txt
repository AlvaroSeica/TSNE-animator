I recently received an Axil 245 with Solaris 7 on it. The computer didn't 
come with a monitor (I checked it out on one, however), and has a 13W3 
connector on the back.

Has anyone had experience writing this (or a related) machine to a PC

connectors?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Dispersion


The spews and emissions of the universe are of fundamental consequence; 
from plasmas through aerodynamics, particle fields through one-to-many 
electromagnetic transmitters, dispersion characterizes the world. Objects 
are temporary at best; objects cohere, disperse, decay, splinter, 
dissolve, discharge, as in decathexis. What cathects is temporary at best; 
'defuge' is a basic process that sloughs attentivity and value. As groups 
form and dissolve, temporary genidentity structures local flows; one 
participates, drops out, identifies, decathects, and so forth, from birth 
to death; after death, the aura of effects transforms and continues, while 
the name and provenance become increasingly remote.

Dispersion occurs on-line and off (Rheingold's Smart Mobs); packet 
transmission itself is both dispersion and coalescence. If a site does not 
acknowledge, error messages may be returned to the transmitter, as if they 
were growing fainter (they do not) with each passing communication, until 
the time limit is reached; then everything stops. Lost messages constantly 
float, as do disconnected webpages, dead-ended links, any forms of 
interruptions within the temporary flows and stases that constitute both 
inter- and intranets.

Writing or programming or producing within these spaces, these paradigms, 
(which themselves are in flux) is problematic; hardware and software, 
languages and protocols, die out. There is an apocalyptic air to what can 
only be labeled _dispersion production,_ an air of disappearance which 
pervades the work produced; nothing is as permanent as modernism. What 
remains is the remnants or residue of audience, for whom the work is 
peripheral; instead, it is the political economy of the structure and 
state-space of the work, in terms of communality and accessibility, that 
determines its relative value. Genre, typology, typification, become 
irrelevant, replaced by situational analysis. What is functional is the 
occasion and occasioning of speech. 

And speech is not only _parole,_ momentary enunciation; it parasitizes 
writing and inscription. Inscriptive production problematizes and 
occasions dispersion production; dispersion production problematizes and 
occasions inscriptive production through speech and other communicative 
acts. 

We are mistaken to the extent we desire the occasion to override the
occasional. The occasional is the kernel (to the extent that the kernel 
absorbs identity) of infinity; the disappearance of identity is also the 
disappearance of all products of labor, piecemeal or otherwise. That is 
why we say, "Nothing matters at all, except you!" "I am nothing without my 
fans!" "The use-value is replaced by the exchange value!" "You are 
everything to me!"

Nikuko-Dispersion


Nikuko-Dispersion is language independent, programming independent, 
context-free, protocol independent. Nikuko-Dispersion is digital-eternal, 
infinitely duplicated, the phenomenology of equivalence. The structure of 
Nikuko-Dispersion is that of transmissions and receptions, transmittings 
and receivings, a structure of residues and flows.

The digital-eternal is no such thing in praxis, therefore no such thing. 
Masteries and technologies erode, are forsaken. Every potential well is 
statistical at best. There are no ultimate solutions. 

Nikuko-Dispersion is Nikuko-Filter, transformations in which the Nikuko 
kernel is parasitic, the coloration of flux, just as all avatars are 
filters. Someday we will find all entities, processes, continuums, states, 
and operators are filters, that the cosmos is a collocation of filters and 
jostlings of filters.

Nikuko-Filter adapts to languages, programs, and protocols. Nikuko-Filter 
is an adaptation. Filter and Dispersion are equivalent; one is not the 
parasitic on the other, nor is one the object to the process of the other. 

What holds for Nikuko-Filter, Nikuko-Dispersion, holds for N-Filter, 
N-Dispersion, where N is ontologically equivalent and dispersed among 
traditional process- and entity-oriented ontologies. These transform- 
ations are understood as fundamental to the universe in its entirety. 

(Think of Filter-Dispersion, _difilter,_ _difiltering,_ _difiltration._ 
Any neologism will do.)

George Bush fucks everyone in sight. He sucks Iraqi stumps. He murders 
Iraqi children. He crawls over his daughters wallowing in shit-muck with 
very secret service. He is known killer. He keeps M. Hussein for private 
pleasure bound and gagged. He can't sleep. His cock is hard with napalm. 
He shits on M. Hussein. Suddein chokes and falls over. He thinks. They 
both think. Their mouths are full of one another. They hear voices:

Philosophy Text of the Northern Trek


We ran off, it was an exciting escape! We left the ruined snowmobile at
3000 meters and began our slow trek northward. We went passed fallen
ski-lifts, half choked by glaciers, cormorants nesting among the rusted
cables. We continued northward. Anything to escape the wars and slaughters
in the south. In the south, humanity was disappearing; blind animals died
sullenly beneath the noon-day sun. We walked across the upper crusts of
the glacial beds, crevices everywhere. Some disappeared, the rest of us
continued to the station. We hoped for signs of life. We were disappointed
at the ruined station. Corroded batteries were everywhere. The fury had
hit; we thought it stopped elsewhere. Everywhere the planet shuddered; the
obscene auroras with their unearthly colors reflected the future of the
world. "Stop Here" he said. "This is as far as we can go." But the rest of
us left, and continued our trek. He was speaking to himself now, mumbling
and describing the death of billions. Breathless, we approached the frozen
waters of the polar ocean. The last remnants of surface life moved slowly
to the meandering field of true north. Unaware of global precession, our
trek continued, shuddering in our tracks. The nights were harsh with
bioluminescent fury beneath the missiles overhead. They crawled, exploded
across the sky, raining radioactive debris into the frozen north. Metal
fragments burned through the ice in fiery storms. We watched silently,
vowing to remain there, as the ice began to crack. We heard shouts of
"Open water!" over and over again... ...We held on for dear life to the
last vestiges of the polar ice...

(for Prague Literary Review)


Search and Deploy


Thinking about search engines - using the googleapi - their gathering of 
universal information according to their own filtering - bringing in the 
dispersion to the prompt - applying this to principles of universal 
thought and cognition - applying this to philosophical categories - 
looking at everyone's code - the other floating beneath the surface of the 
waters - the other always submerged - we're always submerged ourselves -


1\ Dispersion as the mode of distribution of our time: no receivers,
diminution of symbolic fluxes

2\ Filtering as the parasitic content of dispersion, the residue as the
ghost of the content of the receiving

3\ Difiltering as the ontological and epistemological combination of
dispersion and filtering

4\ Modes of literary production dependent on distributions, with content
that isn't mode-oriented, but filtering and adding semantics to neutral
and neutralized data-streams

distribution is a dissemination, and intellectual property disperses with
the ageing of technology, hacking, quotation, borrowing, remaking. The
universe itself is characterized by entropy; creation is always absorptive
and disruptive. Representation itself is an act of delimiting. All is
characterized by plateaus in non-equilibrium thermodynamics that sooner or
later collapse; the resulting chaos is the dispersion of what remains of
memory, the debris of once-articulated hopes and dreams.

is not a virus; it's a filter, parasitic on the real; filtering is the
third in the channel between sender and receiver. Filtering creates
content as residue, employing the protocols; filtering also ensures that
receivers disperse, splay. The filter passes as text, work, entity, human,
state, process; it's a masquerade. The filter is protocol's ghost;  
protocol is filter's ghost. They are interdependent ghast/geist/wraithe.

7\ Dyphylterososyng ahz pe ontologykeyl &... epyhztemologykeyl

the acting of being and becoming among plasmas and implicate orders,
content riding protocol, protocol riding content, both equivalent,
embedded in the noise of their structure and semantics. Codework styles do
nothing but surface submergences, only to temporarily create stases of
Others, as if the world were stable. No wonder ontologies and
epistemologies are incoherent, confused; wonder at their apparent
appearance otherwise.

has either the one or the other, a disaster, back to modernity and

already filtered - both proceed as if there's a source or origin - it's
the source or origin that's identified as thinking and moving in the world
- it's the source or origin that gives rise to culture - that tends
towards an inconceivable and inauthentic absolute - that tends towards
this absolute with its inherent violence -

Been looking through Google Groups for my first post - as follows - I 
don't know why this is still of interest, but my interests seem to have
remained fairly consistent over the past decade or so. It's one of the old 
bitnet lists/newsgroups - no idea if it's still running. As usual I have
spelling errors - Lyotard's differend was meant which is all the

It is certainly relevant to discuss Letterman since this is also a
video discussion group. I do watch the show, on and off; there are
periods when I watch it a great deal. At this point the show is
fascinating from a theoretical viewpoint because of its complete
absorption of conceptual/postmodern attitudes of
fragmentation/cynicism/cynical documentary - and turning these
attitudes into a completely sutured surface, as modernist as any
glass and steel office-building. The show is perfect in its way. As
far as Pekar is concerned, he's always of interest - as are other
"discomforting" guests - because they permit the show a degree of
latitude, the reification of a subaltern opposition that in reality
plays into Letterman, i.e. the role of (Lyotard's) different. It's
interesting also in respect of all of this to watch Conan O'Brien's
show which is always in the process of working itself out - WORKING -
the labor of the thing is evident.
