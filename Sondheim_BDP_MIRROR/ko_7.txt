Poetics (End of Saying Texts)


When they escape, they are of interest. When they can't type because
they're out of control, that's when they type. When their eyes burn with
dark fires reflected in the soot and sparks surrounding them. When there
are pyres. When there are ghosts.

When Jennifer wills Alan alive so that Jennifer can't think any more. When
her limbs are caught in his. When her breath is his own. When she traces
writing into wryting, forcing the flesh through the i's. When emerges,
when the tablet is broken, scroll opened, envelope unsealed: there are
holes. When there are beings in the holes. 

Alan is afraid of theory, just as Alan theorizes. In Disorders of the
Real, he saw the roots for what they were. In The Case of the Real, what
doesn't fall apart, frays at the edges.

Virtual Alan begs Jennifer to let him live.
