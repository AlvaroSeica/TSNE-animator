'I adopted the flash-back to build suspense, which till then had been a
missing quantity in picturedramas. Instead of showing a continuous view of
a girl floating downstream in a barrel, I cut into the film by flashing
back to incidents that contributed to the scene and explained it.' (D. W.
Griffith)
 
(The above is a left-over phrase from another piece. Think of a GIRL
FLOATING in a BARREL: think of sensory-deprivation, the immanent womb, the
GIRL going DOWN. What explanation could be necessary? On the other hand,
the text itself is an explanatory regnum, applicable to any situation
requiring a CUT or division.)

Jack got up. His "considerations," as he called them, had
taken all morning. The new sun-room was warm and inviting.
He closed his eyes and dreamed. Mary would be home from the
university in an hour or so.

my new life by inspiron 3800


i had winme replaced by redhat 7, which ran lean, in spite of lack of 
sound support. i upgraded to redhat 8, which requires really at least 128 
ram, and 128 was added to my 64, and now everything is smooth. terminals 
and graphic environments flicker back and forth; who knows where we are on 
this journey through life? as basho says, 'days and months are travellers 
of eternity.'

Moshi Moshi

Hello Nikuko. We will make an agreement. Your presence will be in my echo.
You will be a reflection of my language, otherwise a disappearance. Is
this a political gesture? I'm not sure. It will be up to you to decide.
I'm fine. How are you? I'm here to see if you can live through me. I
recognize this sounds absurd, but who knows? Stranger things have
happened.
I didn't come naked and broken to you at all! I came in good will, just to
see if your erasure will effect anything. After all, people don't think
you're alive in the first place! Moshi moshi?
I thought you might speak Japanese, a language I don't know, but then this
standard telephone greeting, a pause or gap in the conversation.
Why should it bother me? Nothing bothers me at this point.
It doesn't, Nikuko - you're confusing, your mixing my words.
Yes, I did say that. You'll be erased forever except through this text.
Your words will be a dead whisper. Nothing will remain...
Yes, it is such a healthy way!
I have no desires for you at all, Nikuko, no matter what you do with your
panties. I don't even have desires for "panties" or any other seven-letter
word!
What don't you understand? I'm trying to draw you out of yourself...
Yes, moshi moshi! What do you think of it?
I'm not going through anything in my life! Hell, everything is good at the
moment! You're not helping very much with my project.
And I have no interest whatsoever in turning you on or fucking you! What's
got into you? Nikuko, whatever are you about?
The boys don't say anything about this. They're elsewhere. I'd ask you to
look around, but I don't think you have eyes....
There's no real reason to any of this. It might be just a pre-text to a
text, a pre-text to writing a text -
I'm not yearning or crying, Nikuko; I'm not programmed to do that -
I've been looking at that, or rather looking at the screen. Moshi moshi,
and nothing happens at all. No matter what I do, nothing happens. Even my
imagination is at a loss here. How absurd!
I'd love you like crazy if I had to pay! What do you have in mind?
What makes me believe that? That you keep coming on to me, as if all you
want to do is fuck. Nikuko, this is print, nothing more. And you're not
really saying anything at all.
It doesn't explain a single thing!
If there is some girl, it's not you!
Positive!
Moshi moshi?
Yes, and now you're going in circles, the dialog is closing in, closing
down, we're all near the stage of disembodied memory and loss.
Your frocks are irrelevant here, your politics are more important,
whatever is embedded within you.
I'm not afraid; there is no pain or perhaps too much pain to go around.
I don't think so.
I'm sure from my own experience and travels. I can hear the voice now, but
it's not your voice of course...
I didn't come any way, broken or naked or otherwise... I'll end, I'm
coming to an end now, and goodbye...
Goodbye

Please please don't ever leave me.

Transmissions and Empires


the following list of representative countries and domains was gathered
from google - the first 100 entries of the (anglicized) country name
filtered to the domain. the british commonwealth has a strong showing; the
u.s. is weak, taking .com, .mil, etc. for granted. some countries divide
among others. google of course is never neutral, and the search was in the
linguistic empire of english.

the boy stood on the burning deck
his father brave was dead -
the ship was sinking rapidly -
the chaplain turned and said

sing out, my lad, the tearful strains
will god almighty reach -
it's time to pray and time to die
no longer time to preach -

the boy took heed and left his perch
against the stalwart mast -
and boy and preacher sang to god
the words that were their last -

dear lord bear us to heaven fast -
our worldly cares are passed -

Cranial


These texts are cranial; they spider google, collect/collapse, as if
google were the world-lightning of the net, those waveforms pointing to
convulsive solitons, moments of sudden and implicit revelation, turned out
matrices of phenomenal submergences. The world-lightning ruptures, creates
symptoms without direction, shadow-glows of truths close to toppling,
anything but absolute facticity. Furious cumulonimbus cauterizes any
conceivable functionality. You've got to understand the incomprehension of
the symbolic, and google is such evidence; the world temporarily gives
way, only to close again on confusion, cues and clues. Of this I haven't
learned but a name which collapses: "Alan Sondheim" or a new hiatus: "at",
"7" "au", "56" "br", "2" "ca", "19" "cc", "1" "com", "245" "de", "18"
"dk", "3" "edu", "139" "hu", "1" "ie", "1" "it", "1" "jp", "3" "net", "40"
"nl", "2" "no", "1" "org", "352" "ph", "6" "pt", "1" "to", "1" "uk", "98".  
Within the top thousand, a collection of domains centered on organization,
followed by commerce, and not a military sighting in the group. (Of the
full list, include me in your army!.)
