Reviewing By Country


Here are the results of reviewing FOP-L and Cybermind by country. Note
that the country spread is greater per user for Cybermind (36 against 14)
and that in both cases, the resulting curve, organized by demographic
rank, would approach that of an exponential. It would be wonderful if we 
could extend our member-bases so that Italy, for example, would have more 
than one representative or exponent - actually neither, but an _index_ at 
the least. So the spread of the demographics, for the most part, is an 
illusion...

In FOP-L, 7 countries are represented by one person, or 50%; in Cybermind,
17, or 47%, almost the same. Let us expand each of these ten-fold, let us
build tentative networks, bases, world-wide, let the lists embed them-
selves in multiculturalisms, let us see what emerges at the dawn of the
millennium...
