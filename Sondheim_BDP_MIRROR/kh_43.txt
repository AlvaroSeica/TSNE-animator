Parable of possible questions from the Santa Cruz talk (see above)


Are there ethics, and do ethics play a role in my work? Are Nikuko,
Jennifer, and Julu automatically written, or do you write them? Do they
write you as well? Are the things that are sent back and forth through the
government post office in danger of not being sent back and forth because
of the government's involvement in the Net? Do you write about anything
other than sex? What is the point of all of this? Have you ever actually
spoken to Nikuko? What does her voice sound like? Does she mind all of
this writing? Does she ever get upset with you? What do her friends think?
How can your writing be real the same way a sonnet is real? Do you ever
read sonnets? Do you ever read poetry at all? What does Nikuko think about
poetry? How good is her English? Have you ever stolen any of Jennifer's
poems? Does she know what's going on at all? Does Jennifer mind that you
use her Julu avatar? Is Jennifer psychotic? What do you think about a
decentralized mode of communication that allows home control over tailor-
made components? Does Nikuko own a computer? Does it do English?
