 Oh, I'm waiting for you; I've got the Nuts ./a.out running on port 3000, 
 Oh, I'm waiting for you; I've got the Haven -d scrambling on port 7000,
 Oh, I'm waiting for you; I've got the Slip up and running on my machine,
 Oh, I'm waiting for you; I've got daemons all over the place,
 I've got sendmail, I've got inetd, I've got httpd, I've got daemons
 Oh, I'm waiting for you; I've got my Web wide open on port 80,
 And O! these daemons everywhere! and O! A girl in every port!
