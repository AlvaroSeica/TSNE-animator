Stared Stiff


I'm staring at:

Dynamic HTML, The Definitive Reference
Web Design in a Nutshell
Linux in a Nutshell
Year 2000 in a Nutshell
Internet in a Nutshell
Learning Perl on Win32 Systems

and I'm thinking: The _thickness_ of these texts presenting _potentials_
or matrices resulting long term in the construction of _worlds._ Dynamic
HTML (Danny Goodman) set me off in this direction - page after page of
reference (and of course still nothing compared, say, to the X Window
manuals) - particulations, attributes of objects, protocols given in full.
What I'm referencing is the _texture_ of the manual and its role as open
source - atomics - moleculars - for emergences - but also the defuge ass-
ociated with these manuals - the paste-like exhaustion - concatenating
strings - and think of the attributions - the _properties_ - of all the
objects in the world. Like "bgcolor" these are emptied, waiting. Quote
"now that the _animate_ object is defined" - further - <BODY><DIV ID="ani-
mate"> This Enormous Life-Form Which Will Dominate Your Small and Vulner-
able BODY </DIV></BODY> - HTML is all HEAD and BODY - ANIMATEDHTML - "Our
Animate Boy" - 1933 - "Our Animate Girl" - 1944 (more complex and in War-
time) - What is the Life-Form - What is Emerging from this Thickness - Who
are the Readers with Talons - What Surgical Performances - What Satanic
Mills -
