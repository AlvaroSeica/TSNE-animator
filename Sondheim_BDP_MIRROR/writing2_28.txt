For those who want it, here is a short bio (and don't hesitate to get in 
touch with me if you have any questions!) -


Alan Sondheim's books include the anthology Being on Line: Net Subjecti-
vity (Lusitania, 1996), Disorders of the Real (Station Hill, 1988), and
.echo (alt-X digital arts, 2001) as well as numerous other chapbooks,
books and articles. His video and films have been shown internationally.
Sondheim co-moderates several email lists, including Cybermind, Cybercul-
ture, and Wryting. For the past several years, he has been working on an
"Internet Text," a continuous meditation on philosophy, psychology, lang-
uage, body, sexuality, and virtuality. Sondheim lives in Brooklyn, New
York and teaches part-time at the School of Visual Arts; he lectures and
publishes widely on contemporary art and Internet issues. In 1999, Sond-
heim was the second virtual writer-in-residence for the trAce (sic) online
writing community, originating in Nottingham, England. He is currently 
Associate Editor of the online magazine Beehive, and is assembling a spec- 
ial topic for the America Book Review on Codework. His video/soundwork has 
been recently screened at Millennium Film (NYC), as well as Western 
Ontario and York Universities (Toronto).
