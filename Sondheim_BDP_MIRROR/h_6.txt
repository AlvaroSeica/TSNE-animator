Subject: Footnote to the Life-Definition







It seems to me that life then possesses two dialectical characteristics -

interesting to think of it this way - the first is a tendency towards

totality, boundary-recognition and defense/repetition - and the second is

a tendency towards fragmentation, heterogeneity. The latter occurs as

_internal_ divisions within the former; the heterogeneous is itself repro-

ducible.
