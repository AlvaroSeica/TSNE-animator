Space of Wonder and Consolation on the Cybermine Talker *


Room: ill-logic

Broken forms, ragged edges, fragments, languages, scrolls.

Come here when the words tangle in your throat, when sounds from nowhere
murmur and cry, when you feel the problem in your stomach, the solution
in your womb, insoluble.

You are all alone here.

Current topic: Wonder

*** The ill-logic message board ***

When things are difficult and there is no beginning
And there is no ending to their difficulty
And they lie entwined like lovers speaking for the last time
About the nature of _things_ and _things_ are in the way
Of things and lovers; then appear in this space once and forever
To heal, ascertain, overcome, measure their beginning
Of everything and all; you will heal, wounds turned deep, and scars
>From wounds and no more, and thus you will a woman be, or man
Or gender-free, the sullen flesh expanded into ecstasy
For you, for me, and ease will rule the stars.
