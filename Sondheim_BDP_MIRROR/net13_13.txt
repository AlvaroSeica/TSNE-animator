My Medical Expert System





My new palmtop came with medical software, a patients' directory that

allows me to track the condition of everyone around me. I can enter

my friends' names in it, complete with their illnesses, my drug treat-

ments for them (also whether they're cured), and the symptoms that led

to my diagnoses in the first place. I carry the palmtop everywhere I

go, tracking their progress from day to day. I love doing this because

I know all the time just how they feel! Here are some results.



Unable to resist, I begin with myself. I must admit I am not a medical

doctor (although I have propensities, like everyone else, in that di-

rection); some of the terminology may in fact seem resplendent and of

my own making. But it is a patients' medical directory, and as true as

can be!
