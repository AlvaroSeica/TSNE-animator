to thwart under these circumstances: interventions of
 glitch-physics, edge phenomena coupled with boundary
 transgressions
example: once beyond sim boundaries, chat dialog no
 longer presented itself within the virtual world (see 
 above); it was only readable from the chat slot itself
example: logged out and in, finally in an anomalous
 space beyond/without the homeland, there I could speak
 but neither move nor see

thwart as capital, as mechanism, as boundary control
thwart as detumescence, collapse, debris field
thwart as absence, as future anterior, annihilation
thwart as absence of others, as the act of absenting
thwart as control-glitch and glitch-control
thwart as the fragility of good things in catastrophe
 theory
thwart as data-breaching, digital degree-zero
thwart as the phenomenological horizon of the universal
 future




Measurement


"These measures are suitable for the post. One suitable form 
should he produce and make the post. They say, however, 'One 
should not measure the post; let it be unmeasured; the measured 
by the measured one wins; the unmeasured by the unmeasured; 
(therefore it serves) to win the incommensurable.'" (Kausitaki 
Brahmana, Adhyaya X 1)

"Agni is the lowest of the gods; Visnu the highest; between them 
are all the other deities. A cake to Agni and Visnu on eleven 
potsherds they offer in connexion with the consecration; verily 
they offer it without omission to all the deities. All the 
deities are Agni; all the deities are Visnu; Agni and Visnu are 
the two terminal forms of the sacrifice. In that they offer the 
cake to Agni and Visnu, verily thus at the ends they prosper as 
regards the gods. They say 'In that the cake is on eleven 
potsherds, and Agni and Visnu are two, what is the arrangement 
here for the two, what the division?' That for Agni is on eight 
potsherds; the Gayatri has eight syllables; the metre of Agni is 
the Gayatri. That for Visnu is on three potsherds, for thrice 
did Visnu stride across this. This is the arrangement here for 
the two, this the division. (Aitareya Brahmana, Pancika I, 
Adhyaya I 1)

The Seminal Cinema: Codework petit a

Going through the older essays on codework, I'm drawn to the 
concepts of 'smear/smudge/splurge/smatter' as codework dissolves 
in terms of the _discrete symbol_ to various modes of decay; now 
I think of it as _dreamwork,_ the production of the dream 
through smeared codes, not through anything axiomatic, nor 
through clean and proper, i.e. runnable, language. Then codework 
also appears as part-objects, object petitioned ah, the route of 
the circle, the circumambulation; like the sm objects I wrote 
about so long ago, such part-objects either latch onto and 
modify or mollify fluid texts, or they create such texts, 
dissolve within them. The kn% date for example is performative, 
reminiscent of performance, and even within _this_ short test, 
it functions as a reminder or marker for the specificity of time
guided by a universal and exhausted clock. The part-object of 
codework supplies a phenomenology of embedding or self-embedding 
- a horizon construed as a self-horizon, one in the form of a 
mobius topology, transforming and returning within itself; I 
think of the 10 oxherding pictures which portend stages on the 
way to and from enlightenment for example, without any such, or 
with the presence of annihilation and emptiness at the heart of 
things. The background of codework is uncanny; otherwise, it's 
flat-lined code or a picture. The uncanniness is a diacritical 
mark, as if something has occurred in the midst of, or through, 
non-occurrence. The body reads and renders codework as such, and 
codework _now_ disappears to the extent it's codework; it 
attaches to image, sound, dynamics, video;

it is always an approach for or within the duratoin or dwelling, 
habitus of a body that is striated from the moment of birth; the 
body of course is always already on the way to, among, decay, 
and just as the universe unfurls in the form of granularities 
and percolations, so there are strange attractors within the 
trajectory of the body - these are the dynamics that constitute 
our lived world. The attractors from this viewpoint are codework 
as well, the working out of momentarily stabilizing and dynamic 
chaotic structures; the world, in other words, is filled and 
fulfilled by codework which constitutes itself.
