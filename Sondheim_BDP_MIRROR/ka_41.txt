When the Symbol isn't Reading, Read


Myouka learning kanji: Take the symbol for yen - you see it every-
where in Japan, where, at least, you know what you're paying, even if
you don't know what you're paying, for.

I recognize the symbol everywhere, read it as "yen."

But I don't read it, nor do I know the _gift_ of the symbol _for_ yen,
which is foreign to my thought, just as "y," "e," "n," do not consti-
tute the symbol-for-yen, but instead, _spell yen out._

Spelling-out is constructed from the double-articulation of alphabet
and word: Alphabet is adjunct to the word, supple tool or mechanism
(high use-value) which is applicable to _any_ word, new or older or
foreign.

In Hebrew, the relationship is one-to-one: Know the spelling (includ-
ing the vowel dots), and you know the word. This works in reverse as
well, almost entirely.

In English, we know "off," "cough," "rough," "huff," and so forth -
and there are those who consider, as a result, English ideogrammatic.
But even if so, there are only 26 ideograms, entirely.

Think of kanji broken-articulations, roots here and there, stroke
order, blocked ideograms which are irreducible. Think of a dictionary
of 500, 6000, 45,000. In a sense this is easy enough. Children learn
one or two kanji a day, by rote.

But I think that the kanji for "yen," and _the word itself_ are visit-
ing each other, contingent at best, in spite of the _image_ or poten-
tial story of the symbol. And I cannot _see_ this relationship; it
breaks internally, although quite familiar.

It doesn't feel like reading. It feels like an infinite distance be-
tween strokes and word, strokes and meaning. It's lost on me.

Three symbols for "Western Japan," Nishi Nippon. Three more for jido-
sha, automobile. Sha, wheel, like a chariot from above - body, axle,
wheels on both sides. I can recognize them, the Western Japan Auto-
mobile place where you might get your cars worked on. Memorized the
tripling of symbol, word, and meaning.

Still cut open, so I can't read, can't write. Still broken in two.

_Elsewhere,_ I recuperate my writing, bring it in, bring it together,
comfortable with lower ascii. It slips too easily from its moorings. I
make mistakes (but words aren't things). I confuse myself (but things
_are_ by virtue of words).

At a loss, I dream of strokes, thick black ink pouring over everything
in the world, culture's burial in the hysteria of viscous speech.

Every post an ideogram, every entry in netindex.txt (indexing Internet
Text at http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/~spoons/internet_txt.html
or http://www.anu.edu.au/english/internet_txt) a totality, construct, as
if there were no other, as if each ideogram were the last, as if the
_natural_ were reasserting itself once again.

The ideogrammatic lends itself to misrecognition and the delusion of the
bracketing of origins: Just as _this_ means _that,_ so I assert that _A_
is _B_ and describe what might be considered the material or _stuff_ of
meaning. 

Consensus disappears in the dream, when it's revealed that screens are
just that, and that no one seems to cast a shadow.
