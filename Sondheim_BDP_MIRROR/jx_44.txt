Rewrite of Louis Untermeyer's, "Any City" (The Masses, July 1913)


Any City


Down each shuddered thoroughfare,
 She takes her nightly walk;
Exhausted, she is hardly there -
 They watch her like a hawk.

She transforms into thing of flesh,
 Despised by men - desired;
Those selfsame men who would enmesh
 Her soul, have nothing sired.

No female grace or charm or wile,
 No beauty, sense of power;
She offers a pathetic smile
 That lasts a useless hour.

The street has seen her come, and go;
 It offers nothing real,
And she is hard, and won't forgo
 Diamonds, wine, a meal.

Like Sleazy, she's a walkabout,
 A cutup who's been cut -
Don't waste your time, don't twist and shout,
 She's really in a rut.

She's twenty-threed, she's skidooed too,
 She's got it, oh you kid,
The lies, the thefts, she's in a stew -
 Take pity, smoke a lid.
