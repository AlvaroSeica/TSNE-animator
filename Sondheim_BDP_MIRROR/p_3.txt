As far, by the way, as my tribulations, I downloaded still another beta 
version of Netscape 2.0 on top of the first (but later) version and this 
eliminated the quotation marks, but disabled help and find even more... 
On the other hand, I have Display running down deep in DOS and have made 
a nice Window for my Internet using Old English Type and a deep maroon...
