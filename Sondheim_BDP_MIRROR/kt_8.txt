metaphysics of transcendence


when abscess pain takes over the mouth, nothing happens; topical anesthe-
tic or antibiotic or pain-killer do little. at the moment, i can hardly
think, think in a whisper between lightnings: i want the jaw removed. the
point, though, is that among these flashes, another brilliant insight -
that in the abscess, imminence and transcendence, universal and particu-
lar, take over the body - it's not that the region of the jaw expands,
calling attention to itself, but that the body is absorbed in the locus of
pain. in fact, one might say that there is no body, or that the body is
one of becoming-animal - the pain, which is now the phenomenological hori-
zon as a totality (so to speak among the flashes), annihilates the project
of the subject (which is collapsed to the flatness of brute avoidance).
let us now say further that metaphysics itself is the production of
wounds, diseases, pains - all irrupting within and through the body, and
all providing lessons in relatives, absolutes, subjects, objects, ideals,
and the subversion of the true, the beautiful, and the good, wherever,
whatever, and whomever they might be (just as another flash occurs, just
as pain seals off, forecloses, the argument). (in these ages of modernisms
and postmodernisms, we are far from the lessons of the wound.) (yes, there
are wounds, more than ever.) (yes, that is not what i meant.)
