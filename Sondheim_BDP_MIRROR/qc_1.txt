pack

meters in whatever space this is really. you take it with you, carapace 
cloth, it hides you, you move, you move it, it moves. you can move things 
totally gainormous, no leverage involved, only the usual matrix transform- 
ations or maybe perspective all mixed up with sins, cosines, tangents. 
it's all appearance, this thing with its smoke and rafters, balsa struts 
and paper kite folding, the greatest moving freely as the smallest. blown 
air a transformation factored into object emission-spigot movement, it's 
all functions, high-speed rendering gaming physics does. it's that. but it 
give you freedom as well, set up, perform fast, don't even bother to take 
down, just detach, move on before they catch you. audience applause is 
what you live for, every show more spectacular than every other, there's 
no repertoire, just these things that flood, flow about, all going back to 
the dimly-lit (it was dimly-lit) room in the virtual environments labora- 
tory, a few people shuffling about, wires everywhere, up and down them, in 
and out of them. it comes down to files and interrupts, data and keystroke
and mouse, some site and sight involved.

Compression of Originary Bodies

Consider 4 avatars:
f, m, F, M.
F, M, full bodies,
f, m, articulated armature figures
M parents F: F(M)
m conforms to F: F[m]
f conforms to M: M[f]
substituting with liberty:
F([m]M)->F([m]M[f])
F in relation to M, M root:
F(x,y,z,t), where x,y,z,t are real coordinates in 4-space
now consider this a compression of an originary body, B:
B:F([m]M[f]), B in movement from two bodies F' and M',
independent of each other such that H1=F'(x,y,z,t)+M'(x,y,z,t)
H1 = bvh dynamic motion file
now there is a transformation function 
G(H1(F',M',x,y,z,t))->H2(F',M',x,y,z,t), 
filtering H1, resulting in H2
now we have B(t):(H2(F([m]M[f]),F',M',x,y,z,t))
in other words:

The phenomenology of the originary body is dependent on a transformed
dynamic movement file applied to the compression-avatars.

this says nothing mathematically (and is poor math at that); however,
it describes the site of intrinsic performance, evidenced in over.mp4

what does this say but movement files composed of many bodies are
applied to bodies composed of many avatars

we might think of such bodies as matrix-bodies or skein bodies:
what we are witnessing are communities of the virtual body, somewhat
equivalent to the body of virtual communities
think of these as dispersions and coalescences

correct my math.

(The) Only Cosmic Music.

http://www.alansondheim.org/tambura1.mp3
http://www.alansondheim.org/tambura2.mp3

(Please do listen, I am happiest of this of all.)

North Indian tambura digitally descending and ascending.
Perhaps this is the closest one comes to an image-universe.
Artifacts appear and disappear as descent and ascent continues.
For example, audio lissajous towards the end of tambura2.
Of course these are always there.
All music and all sound tends towards this, not towards tambura steady- 
state.
Entanglement with observer and apparatus, intrinsic and extrinsic.
What my ears tell me is what is heard.
What my eyes show me is what is seen.
Loop these for perfection.
There are small events among the continuous movement of the fingers.
Mind in the fingers, among them.
For as not to see after and through eye surgery, the hearing.
And trying not to focus and not to focus on trying.
For the Natyasastra says nothing about the drone.
And the drone is present today with sruti box, melodeon, tambura,
electronic software and hardware.
And is always present.
And is always present and in motion and there is motion in the computer,
there is always motion.
There is always motion that collapses and motion that contracts.
Some motion can't get out, some can't get in.
Some motion can't get out, can't get in.
Sometimes there are objects and states as if existing and these are 
somewhere in the background.
As if existing for all time, to give existence a meaning.
Or huddled-cuddled around themselves, as if there are objects, objects,
objects.
And now you can hear them, there are no objects at all.
As if there were something to hear.
What is heard is the hearing of it.
What is heard are all the times and spaces of the hearing.
Let us call this beauty, untoward.
Let us call.

brooklyn with the left eye


because i'm write/right/rite-eyed-sight/cite/site dominant and now forced 
to use the left, camera tilting w/fixed-focus eye/I/eye-lens with fixed- 
focus lens: what can go wrong? bundling up the color against a u-shaped 
brightness-curve. because neighborhood brooklyn is spring/ing flowering as 
such. but eye/I can't see what i've done, perhaps u-can.

http://www.alansondheim.org/ bklynd jpgs

not only have i taken site for granted, also rite-i-dominance. i think of 
vision as byproduct, a peeling of the surface of the world/whirled, world 
and whirled are me. with my left eye, eye had to search for the view- 
finder; eye-hand coordination was non-existent, as was the remnants of any 
horizon i might have held before me. the whirled veers, precesses, me 
inside the schwarzschild radius. i can't say enough of the virtual; it's 
the area or dream screen that carries entropy. check the equations. my i 
holds off, peels symbol after symbol among balls and spheres. at horizon, 
information is just out of reach, symbols peel off as memory, nothing more 
and nothing accurate. they're heated. the hole collapses, bang boom with 
untoward heat, forget it, just now, I read the text, and it was mine. At 
least for the moment, pre-sent to present. Brooklyn's already disappeared 
- I can't say enough about memory.

Adventures in the Sim Trade: 

Accidental Art and Performance in Second Life


June 2008 through March 2009, I worked in an installation/performance 
space called Odyssey in the virtual world Second Life. I changed the 
environment daily, reflecting dynamic (moving, shuddering) complex spaces 
that were narratives in their own right, difficult to navigate, built on 
phenomenologies of being virtually real, really virtual. I will walk/work 
my way through these transformations, presenting videos and images of 
installations (with Azure Carter), dance (with Foofwa d'Imobilite and 
Sandy Baldwin), and performance (with Sandy Baldwin). This work is unique 
within and without Second Life.

From the original information sheet (all this and more will be explained!)


How to view The Accidental Artist exhibition in Second Life

The exhibition is quite complex; here's some suggestions when visiting:

1. Try turning the glow off. Go to preferences, graphics, and uncheck 
basic shading, if it's on. Basic shading seems to use up more resources 
than anything else with the rendering engine. You can also set things like 
rendering distance; the lower the distance, the faster the loading.

2. Turn the video media button off. This on the lower right-hand corner of 
the screen. If you turn it on, the texture-mapping consumes a huge amount 
of resources. On the other hand, the audio for the parcel (the audio 
button) runs fairly lean.

3. If you find the space too cluttered to enter, try flying in.

4. If you find flying in too cluttered, fly higher, and drop in. There is 
a dome in the center of the space which you can enter.

5. Most objects on the ground level (and some beneath the ground, on the 
seafloor) will flee from you - what looks crowded from a distance might 
well clear out.

6. If it clears out, look up - you'll see all sorts of things above you.

7. Fly vertically to see the rest of the exhibition. If you can't fly as 
high as you want, click control-alt-d, which opens up an advanced menu. 
Open the menu and get rid of camera constraints. You can then move the 
camera at a great distance from your avatar body - your viewpoint moves 
independently, and you can move at least to the top of the exhibition, 
which is maybe a mile or so up, SL measurement.

8. If you get stuck anywhere, teleport back in.

9. Try moving inside the objects; the interior textures are often 
different from the exterior ones (this is almost always the case with the 
spheres).

10. You can push objects vertically into the sky by moving beneath them 
and flying; they flee upwards.

11. You can see the exhibition 'differently' by using the advanced menu, 
going to render, and then looking for info - clicking on any one of the 
info options will give you different viewpoints.

12. You can often sit on moving objects, which will whirl you around; if 
you sit on an object that moves vertically as a result of your proximity, 
you can ride it up. When you stand up again, you can fall down back into 
the space. The riding height seems to be around 4117 SL units, but unless 
you have a flight bracelet or feather, you probably won't go that high.

13. Moving about on the ground level, keep the sound turned on (lower 
right), and you'll hear a variety of songs about SL and language. These 
mix with a number of looping sound modules embedded in the space.

14. If you've been moving around SL a lot, go to preferences, and empty 
your cache; this might speed things up. You'll have to restart SL again.

15. If you see a sign for teleporting, try it. Sometimes it will lead back 
to the ground level, sometimes to the seabed, sometimes to a skysphere. 
All of these locations have clickable objects which will take you else- 
where (or back to the same space but at a slightly different location). 
You might have to right-click on the object, then click on teleport - or 
you might just left click - it depends on the object.

16, Try different 'lenses' - click on control-8 to make the image wide- 
angle, control-9 to return to normal, control-0 for telephoto. Repeated 
clicks work as well - with control-8 you can create extreme distortions.

17. Try moving into 'small' spaces and look about. You can save snapshots 
of anything you see, on your hard drive.

18. That's about it. The general idea is to run lean, fly about, teleport 
back if you're stuck, play with the controls. The architecture is constan- 
tly changing and deconstructing itself - play with that....




eye focus elegie last teyeme now

http://www.alansondheim.org/gluon.mp3 dotar 

this is the last teyeme eye'll be able to _focus_ my eyes,
 one, right, remaining yet for surgery, muscles and lense still
 working fyene,
 Sun Apr 19 23:21:51 EDT 2009
someteyemes working on music eye will come across
eye will come across a piece based on a particular musical deveyece
such is the case with gluon, releyes on a steyele of fingering
breaking out with small sections of revereye murmuring
as gluons spread across the world, a universe
what black hole horeyezon beckons us forward, eye'm coming, going
 nowhere and everything normal, just outseyede every universal
 thinging dissolved or dissolution
so this is elegie to normal eyes, eyes within eyes, within glass,
 so this is a moment before the brittleness of the world
 furiously announces itself, eye would remain deaf, 
 were eye could, seyete already issues with surgereye, oh the one
 completed, 'one to go and fixed,' but what eye shall speak about,
 when music moves from steyele or technique to moment,
 the world holds still, my father in hospital, and
there is no tapping, there are sections, small eyevents, you listen
and you listen with care to these and other small eyevents
for though deaf eye may become and tinneyetus spread, yet sound holds
 supple
sound holds supple and bending with deleyet, no crystalline
and no world and no seyete elastic more than pre-sent now
and eye play for you
yes, eye play for you
wheyele meye eye still moves, wheyele the world still swirl around me

new zone to wander among
high-speed elements captured in such a manner that position 
 is untenable
what is posited is invisible
rotation at 700 rpm +/- and in other words, due to approximation
 configurations constantly change
weathers constantly change

yet another model disseminated from a limited number of parameters
too many models, defuge, useless, one after another, parade of models
wheels or go-karts with no track, no trek, all trick
in such a world self-hatred stands one in good stead

wandering among zones
models of nothing in particular

Romeo Di Giorgio guitar solos

I'm writing an article for Signal to Noise magazine on the 1949 Romeo Di 
Giorgio guitar I own and have used for decades now; it's always been my 
main instrument. As a way of preparing, I recorded the following four solo 
(songs) with it; I was in an odd state and able to actually able to play 
complexly without too much difficulty. This is unusual - it allowed me to 
inhabit the music in a different way than unusual. I've also included 
notes on the instrument - images will follow, at least for the magazine. 
Thanks for listening - Alan

1949 Di Giorgio classical guitar. I bought this instrument in Cambridge, 
Mass, around 1967, and I've had it ever since. I started playing music 
after a disastrous relationship; this was 1962, and I was influenced by 
Lightning Hopkins. I learned chords in alphabetic order, A,B,C,D,E,F,G, 
and the sharps/flats in due order. I went through a number of guitars, 
settling on a Gibson electric and the Di Giorgio. In the Cambridge scene, 
Al Wilson considered me a 'city blues player' because I played fast, but I 
was more John Fahey than Charlie Patton. Other instruments came and went, 
but the Di Giorgio has stayed with me. When I bought it, the clerk at the 
music store cried; he'd been using it himself in concerts. It cost $75. It 
came with 17 cracks and still has 17 cracks. It's gone through two floods, 
one in a closet in Providence, Rhode Island, and one in a warehouse in Los 
Angeles, after having traveled back from Tasmania. 

The guitar is remarkable: inside the soundhole, there's a hyperboloid 
surface extending to within an inch of the back. This is from eighteenth- 
century guitar experiments, but I haven't seen any other contemporary 
guitar with the device. This device is also found in the current Di 
Giorgio Tarrega model (which however has an oval soundhole).

Parameter sets and their construct of the visual

Slowly changing the parameters in Second Life, modifying the dynamics 
accordingly. Note the central vortices towards the end of param.mp4 and 
the rough double helices which reverse themselves earlier.
The three variable arenas:
1. The parameter sets of the dynamics built into the atmospheric space 
of the virtual world; these change over time, hence higher derivatives.
2. The parameter set of the revolution of the invisible armature carrying 
the particle emission nodes.
3. The parameter sets of the emission nodes themselves.
The result is, at least visually, chaotic sets of particles confined 
within parameterized frameworks; for example, no particle lasts longer 
than 30 seconds before disappearing.
"An interesting experiment with close to immediate results."

Death Accompanied by Double Dissipations


The matrix of the habitus corrodes almost from birth.
Nothing is left but memories which are necessarily filtered.
Filtered memories are cauterized.
The corrosion is absolute and complete.
The past is a state of permanent withdrawal.
People as well as environments disappear and most of either have 
 a last time or moment deeply unrecognized: I don't remember when
 I saw him last; you can't see him again.
When did the war end, when did any war end?
These are the deaths of others within the aegis of my death, events
 are always on the horizon.

My death among the lives of others: dissipation of the habitus.
The collapsed habitus, fading out, expands. .
Trails begin without ending; these trails end for no one.
I am no longer around for the trails and their meanders, events are
 always on the horizon.

The trails are objects, processes, scents, sounds, sights.
My life connects them; they're blurred, communal among themselves.
It's always a masquerade, this communality.
A masquerade and a fantasm, always already dissolved and dissolute.
Isn't it like this, holarchic structures observed, created, recreated.
I have so much to tell here, and time runs out.
Worlds and words and levels and what remains, an invisible skein.
Structuring is destructuring, events are always on the horizon.
 
Goodbye to everything who know me, I release you, you release me,
 just as I release you, just as we are unknown among one another,
 unknown among ourselves, ourselves unknowing, events are always
 on the horizon.

the lost Lost text

The main text from the Lost Project created for the trAce online writing 
community; visitors to the site were asked to enter their email address 
and then describe something they lost. On "playback" the list of email 
addresses was separated from the list of the lost; in other words, the 
tether was broken. The text of what was lost is a form of literature 
itself; it had disappeared in my files until now. What was lost is now 
found, what is found can never be recuperated. I think the Lost Project is 
still located at the trAce archives; trAce ended as a community headed by 
Sue Thomas, a few years ago. The project was created around 1999-2000, 
when I was trAce's second virtual writer-in-residence. Please check out 
the text; it's oddly beautiful, the result of so many minds.

I want to thank again everyone who made this possible at the time.





with soundtrack, and staying around

serious family and health traumas all over the place going on
so I asked Helfe Ihnen to connect the tambura1.mp3 to the sim
so he said he'd connect it to the land parcel, which, what I run
so it's connected to what I run, which is that object there
so the object's linked and running full tilt boogie ahead now
and the words are moving like crazy and jumping around now
and the tambura's going downhill until the end of the world now
and I wonder where the next event will be
and I wonder how long until something goes normal once again
and I think who will be left when radiation kills the world
so once and for all I've escaped to pure processes
so I've got dynamics running on nothing but virtual particles now
so the downhill tambura tolls the wages of the world now
so the serious the health and the traumas so the downhill words
 are hardly audible when you go there to East of Odyssey now

terpsichoreographic unit (t.u.)

there are two types of t.u.s - one possessing the pylon of the sleeper, 
the other a black featureless sphere.
a dancer/performer sits on either and an animation takes over until 
s/he rises. there are five animations for each t.u. chosen at random.
spherical shells of particles embed the performer.
the black featureless sphere is a black hole with an inverted event
horizon. the particles may trap the display driver into crashing.
the display driver enters overload and the interface enters crash mode.
the pylon sleeper t.u. is a dream production machine trapping the 
dancer into useless dream production particle phenomena. the particles
may trap the display driver into crashing.
the display driver enters overload and the interface enters crash mode.
a t.u. DANCE consists of 4-5 t.u.s in an environment with performers on 
each. performers may stand and move to other t.u.s.
the t.u. INSTALLATION may be placed anywhere at a moment's notice.
variables include animations, particle textures and stream intensities.
of course one may dance in the vicinity of particle streams which 
continue for at least thirty seconds after the performer stands.
one may also assign physicality to the pylon or black featureless
sphere, in which case the object may be GRABBED during particle 
emission and moved; this creates temporary particle FLORA within the
performance space.
videos below give some indication (between computer crashes) of the
mechanism; stills give a few closeups.

fifth solo most difficult of times

when beginnings fall short of endings
when endings erase beginnings
when origination is a memory of origination
when the end disperses for an other
when time penetrates galilean relativity
then and only then is everything beginning always
and what ever any of us think is only an afterthought
say things, surely i can't hear them
and then about beginnings and endings and originations
and then about time and origination's relativity
nothing anyone can hear but
there are beginnings and endings all virtual and lovely
and ragged strings and this sound for you for now
and it's called 'when beginnings fall short of endings'
and it's called 'nothing anyone can hear'

how to create unique sounds in the ukulele field

http://www.alansondheim.org/uku2.mp3

here in pennsylvania i meditate on memory and auschwitz.
my songs forget where they go.
something about a nazi saying jews have no pride, they sang
in the boxcars. 
singing is memory slinging on the far end of a nucleonic string.
everything is ulterior to everything, no matter entanglement.
the discomfort of my work is the false comfort of my world.
my world is your world, is it not.
did i say more than this, i did not.

god the arrogance of the above, as if what one, rather as if what i have 
to say is of interest or consequence, not to mention use or some dark and 
rough equivalence to memory of the real. i would not go so far, i puff 
myself up heedlessly, swollen words fill greater space with puffery...




Levinas in brief

http://www.alansondheim.org/ukufourth1.mp3
http://www.alansondheim.org/ukufourth2.mp3

ukulele with 25% pitch lowering
the speed remains the same.
i'm fascinated by the 'lumbering' quality of the results.
it's as if one projects massivity onto the apparent materiality
of the instrument - strings as thick ropes, etc.
most of the harmony is lost or appears hazy.
physical projection i assume is _always_ present in listening.
it's strongly here.
who is writing about this? not even Helmholtz.
it's as if sound appears disconnected from mass, 
just as philosophy appears disconnected from health.
here is a reversal then dedicated to Levinas' existence and existents.
enjoy.
