s/ms leak from the blood from my body
it's raining out and the s/ms continue to leak
leaking, i begin to think of death in life, and death
the s/ms wash the absolute away
there's no formula, no word, nothing at all
"each woman or man faces death alone"
"nothing accompanies him or her on the long journey"
"there is no destination to the journey"
"these words fail me"
the s/ms wash the word away
the word is the absolute word 
the absolute is the spoken absolute
"each woman or man goes to her or his death in silence"
"this silence is the only silence"
"silence is never in opposition"
couplings are uncoupled, linkages are unlinked
the s/ms burrow-nanotech, the s/ms leak from my body
blood is s/ms, word is s/ms, body is s/ms
silence is s/ms, absolute is s/ms, man or woman is s/ms
s/ms are everywhere and for all time
"only Jennifer has all the time in the world"
"please try to understand Jennifer"
"i am the falling and rising"
the s/ms are the falling and the rising
and the s/ms are uncountable and accounting
the s/ms are uncounted-for and unaccountable
s/ms leak from the blood from my body 
it's raining out and the s/ms continue to leak
leaking, i am emptying, i am dying
"i watch my life ebb away"
"i am alpha and omega"
"all the riches in the world do not stave off death"
s/ms uncoupled, the sidewalks are wet with rain
s/ms unlinked, the rain continues to fall steadily
"i don't want to leave anything unsaid"
"i realize now i've known nothing at all"
s/ms turned from the red-brown pooling blood
"there is so much i have yet to do, so much I want to say"
the rain no longer falls, no silence, nothing
s/ms leak everywhere in the stillborn world
"for all my brilliance, i have achieved nothing"
"i know nothing, have known nothing, have been nowhere"
s/ms still the language, there are rumors of language
there are rumors of language, there are murmurs
"my words go on and on"
s/ms fall from the nighttime sky, rain runs in the gutters
rain washes down the drain, more rain falls from the sky
s/ms fall from the rain, leak from the falling rain
"the world turns and turns, the world too goes on and on"
s/ms in silence, an image of the great wheel
"the image turns, the wheel is still forever"
s/ms leak from the blood from my body
s/ms uncoupled and unlinked
