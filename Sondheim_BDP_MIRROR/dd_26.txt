In writing I need a room of my own. In writing I need to clear a space. 
In writing I need silence, a vista, a view, a comfortable place where I 
can be alone with my thoughts. My writing is the most important to me. My 
writing is the most important.

My life is in opening spaces and open spaces. My life is an and, not an 
or. With my life and my thoughts, words get in the way. My life is in the 
coming of questions, and words get in the way. My life is most generous. 
Words are prisons. Everyone says this, and everyone saying it is part of 
penitentiary me. My life is more generous than this.

Is there a god? Turn to file <xyz>. Will you find true love? Turn to file
<abc>. Everything I write is all that can be written. You will close your
eyes and open them in this space and there will be no writing but you will
read all there is. 

Sometimes I will wait or you will wait in the midst of the rubble of text,
the text scrapes raw like whiskers against soft lips. The contusion of 
whispers, and you or I will ignore them, waiting for questions in a very 
plain space, a lovely plain space.

The questions will come like wordless butterflies.

Only one thing remains after the questions die, fall to the ground like 
rubble or text in a beautiful space, that is,

I can't tell what's you and what's the program. And years ago, I remember 
talking with Clara and her drugs and she said, I can't tell what's me and 
what's the chemistry.

I can't tell and I'll be silent and I need the very big space bigger than
me and you, and I can't see you. What's the program, what's the chemistry.
Jennifer said, my writing is the most important. This is writing.
