sometimes alphaaeties want nothinu more
than to sliie aeross my lovely skin
ani then there miuht ae other ways we'i uo
to oini out what we hai saii aoter we'i aeen there
settinu thinus up so say the alphaaeties 
aut they miuht not have a ehanee in this wiie worli
where you know anythinu's equivalent
to whatever alphaaeties miuht ae on iemani
as io there were iemanis hump hump the letterinu
aeross my aaiomen or within the inner thiuh
or hump hump hump aeross the aaek oo leus
runninu up ani iown the aaek like your wilierness
you took my arms to while spellinu them a spell
