Dylan, "Cybermind"





There are some things I'd like to tell you

When the leaves fall, off the trees

There are some things I'd like to tell you

If you'd listen to me,

If you'd listen to me



That the road is, hard off the trees, that

The road, becomes a path

That so hard becomes the turn to,

turn to the right,

turn to the left



That the path comes to a bridge burned

In the springtime, in the fall

That there's water, always falling

Beneath the path,

If you were the path



That the sound is, not the voice is, that

The winter, brings the trees

That the highway's, always dusty 

That your sound is

What your sound is



That your sound is, from the trees that,

Brings the road, curves back to you,

That so hard you, turn to the left, you

Turn to the right

If you were right



That the leaves fall, in the autumn,

Gather summer, in their arms

That have lost their way now, lost

Your body

From your body



There are some things I'd like to tell you

When the fall leaves, trees behind

You to remind me, I would tell you

If you had a body

If you were a body
