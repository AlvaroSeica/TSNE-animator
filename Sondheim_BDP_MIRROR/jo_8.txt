Balthus (continuation of Jennifer's philosophy):

Heidegger's going out! Heidegger's going out! He's got his costume on!
He's on the run like Rommel. Jabes is mulling the desert. Jabes makes
sand-vortices, sand-tornados. Jabes, on the approach. Would any of us 
be here without Heine? Husserl? Heidegger's shoes end up in a book by
Derrida, painted by Van Gogh, the early days of package mail. Balthus..

Jennifer leans back on the chair, daydreaming... Alan's over by the win-
dow, pulling back the curtains...
