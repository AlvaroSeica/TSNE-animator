"burned atoms," a poem by jennifer-alan

music acknowledging the universe and death
numbers halted while machines run on
waves tearing into violation fabric
burned atoms
o quality natalie step-dance riding writing
name into integer, she owns gift of jennifer-alan
burned asylums, eyes and ochres
at any second plasmas halt worlds strings times
drowned quarks family empathetic motioning the primes
natalie macmaster playing fiddle, i writing laptop
universe coming to an end
