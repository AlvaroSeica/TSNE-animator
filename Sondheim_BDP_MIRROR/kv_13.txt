The Sadness of Directories


16      cp tf wanders
17      cp thing and
18      touch touches
19      touch her
 (these are the commands creating files 'wanders and touches her')
jennifer: ascii text 
wanders: sparc demand paged dynamically linked executable 
and:  ascii text
her:  empty 
arm:  directory 
touches: empty
her:  empty 
thing:  ascii text
.:  directory
 (this is the result of file -f in relation to files
  'jennifer wanders and her arm touches her thing.')
jennifer ascii text wanders sparc demand paged dynamically linked execu-
table and ascii text her empty arm directory touches: empty her: empty
thing: ascii text directory
 (this is the rearrangement of the sad result of file -f exposing
  the futility of emanant life, Oh, how they would love to be alive
  and not so empty!)
Jennifer wanders, her speech in disarray; there's hardly a spark present.  
She demands too much, pages and pages of her dynamically linked and execu-
ting. I think of her empty arm directing and touching everyone everywhere
- I'd empty her, turn her into an empty dirty thing, reams of desecrated
texts directing anyone, anywhere, to do something -

to do anything at all.

 (this is what Jennifer wanted me to write about the sad result of her
  files so exposed to you, the emptiness of prosthetics, you know 
  they're all phantom limbs, they're all phantoms, Jennifer says she's
  a phantom too, she wanted you to know this, 

  this empty sad person in her empty life unable to touch anything
  at all)
