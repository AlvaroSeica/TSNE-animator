Bad Writing Work Wet Dream of Fear and Truth





No time is good for birth. Nothing is ever unborn haha.

I say what there is, and I say what there isn't haha.

And what there isn't, always is, and what there isn't, remains and reminds 

us. And what remains and reminds corrodes by the catalyst:  

The trapped corrosion of love and desire, the trapped corrosion

of the violence of thought come to the presence of the written deed.

Of the written deed of the written dead haha.



My tongue's coated with rock-hard paint, the color of you, 

the color of you haha.

I have been chewed by women spat out by men. 

I say what there is and I say what there isn't haha.

I have done damage, deserve to be punished in a _tendency._ 

I write myself into existence, write myself out of existence.

Love, I write myself in and out of you haha.



I'm suffocating, torn and ravaged by dismembered mother boards harnassing

the heat of the interior.

I'm surrounded by capacitors, leaked blood across skin lined with text 

writing me, me-me haha.

Leaking the desire of all things decathect-decathect.

The universe writes and writes -

the trees write cars write highways scatter bodies across my chest

my arms my legs - the bodies write haha -

Nothing penetrates the throat which closes speech; the word sloughs 

mold, my tongue's coated with rock-hard paint -

My breasts are jealous of your milk, my nipples jealous of your teeth -

My speech fills with vowels spanning empty space,

my lids are stitched shut, slits cut through into a masquerade of light -

O light I say I see the light O light I say -



My existence salutes you haha -

Nothing remains out of the whole cloth but the whole cloth -

Remember the salute haha -

My existence salutes haha -
