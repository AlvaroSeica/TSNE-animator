beneath the water disturbances water-clogged 
earth which is always waters the waters 
talking in the middle of the world 
delicate among elements suspended in water 
eyes open the balance of water and water 
the balance of water and air balance of death 
and water waters mooring waters waters
mooring from the water a message a shrieking angel 

earth lapping at the waters seeped in waters
dispersions of earths and souls and drowned eyes
and drowned 
earths, waters, souls, moorings, souls
