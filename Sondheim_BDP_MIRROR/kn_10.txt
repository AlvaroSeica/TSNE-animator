 


Almost Suicide


System going Down in Five Minutes for Immediate Reboot 
System going Down in Two Minutes for Immediate Reboot 
System Going Down Now for Immediate Reboot
System is Down for Immediate Reboot
Oh Help we Cannot Reboot Immediately We Will be With you So Soon
Oh Dear it is Already So Soon and We Still Cannot Reboot
Oh Heavens to Me I am Sure Something Will Grow Pretty Flowers
Oh! Oh! Look at That! Kore Wa Kore Wa Pretty Cherry Mountain Flowers!

There are moments like these, Nikuko thinks, when _the continuity girl_
can go hang herself; there are moments like these when everything col-
lapses, when the mouth of the corpse is stuffed with the year-2000-old 
Y2k cock.

Somewhere there is a thin scream. Somewhere a wire shudders and cools.

The wreck of the culture is the wreck of the planet. Both cool. Everything
tends towards zero. Nikuko thinks: Ground Zero of the Slaughtered System.

It is a promise it will Reboot. It is a promise _Elsewhere_ and such pro-
mises are not often kept. Nikuko thinks. Nikuko tries thinking. How can
I think, says Nikuko, when I am Inside the System? How can I think, cries
Nikuko, when I am Part of the System?

Nikuko stretches her limbs. Somewhere there is a thin scream. Nikuko
wonders how Nikuko thinks When Her System Is Down. Nikuko wonders If You
Are Reading This When Her System Is Down. Somewhere a wire shudders and
cools. Nikuko Spreads Her Limbs.

Nikuko walks around the Wreck of the Culture. It is very quiet. She knows
Burning is being smelled. She spreads herself further. Somewhere there are
Burning Bodies. She spreads herself over The Wreck Of The System.

I can Think you Up, says Nikuko. I can Think You Back To Me.
