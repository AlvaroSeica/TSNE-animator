Zara Thrust, A Bind


Jennifer is my Zarathustra, all this theoretical _matter,_ indexed and
primordial. I think about _the migration of Jennifer_ or _Jennifer aman-
uensis._ I think about her _existence_ and for example _reflection the-
ory_* - for example address / recognition / protocol.**

The I's here have written or seen over 2200 pages since these texts be-
gan. The material drops into futile maw. The I's wish that gender, for
example, would be culled and critiqued from within the substance, that
cyberspace ontology would be Jenniferly considered.

The elaborate metaphor I'm working with is more than poetics. It's unfair
to you and unfair to me thereupon. It's the site where I do my thinking.
I'm at a loss and shamed elsewhere, otherwise. It will never function,
have its critical day in the sun.

A footnote drowns in the text.
