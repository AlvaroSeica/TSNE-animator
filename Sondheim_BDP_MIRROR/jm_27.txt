Marcus Terentius Varro, V 20, Jerry Everard:


"Wherefore as from _cavum_ 'hollow' come _cavea_ 'cavity,' and _caullae_
'hole or passage,' and _convallis_ 'enclosed valley' as being a _cavata
vallis_ 'hollowed valley,' and _cavernae_ 'caverns' from the _cavatio_
'hollowing,' as a _cavum_ 'hollow thing,' so developed _caelum_ 'sky' from
_cavum,_ which itself is from _chaos,_ from which, in Hesiod, come all
things."

thus chaos occupies hollows, in the form of dust or percolation or sponge,
dust or percolation or sponge in the midst of which sky reigns; men and
women seek caverns in response, roam headlong through valleys hollowed and
enclosed, through innumerable holes and passages, back into the hollows of
dust or percolation or sponge, speared through and through by sky, caverns, 
hollows, and chaos, dusted, percolated, sponged
