Mankind


Mankind placed before fiery craters,
Rolling drums, dark foreheads of warriors.
Footsteps in a fog of blood, the ringing of black steel,
Despair, night in the grieving senses:
Here is Eve's shadow, the hunt, and blood money.
Light breaks through the clouds, the Lord's Supper.
Bread and wine keep gentle silence,
And there the twelve stand assembled.
At night, under the olive-trees, they cry out in their sleep.
Saint Thomas lowers his hand into the wound.
