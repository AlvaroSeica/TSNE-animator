Nikuko reads and writes and thinks about the following:


What don't you think I know?

"The other day when we had a discussion at school about whether our Emper-
or is a war criminal or not, I began to think again about my father...
"One day a little package was delivered to us. It contained a tiny wine
cup from the Emperor, a present to us because our father had been killed
in the war. My little brother, only seven, began to cry. 'Who wants an old
wine cup?' he sobbed angrily. 'They killed our father. We want our fath-
er.' Mother looked anxious and tried to quiet him, but we all had the same
feeling in our hearts... When we grow up we must do something to keep our
country from ever going to war again." (Shunichi Eguchi, 15, quoted in D.
J. Enright, The World of Dew, Aspects of Living Japan, 1954, from a second
book, Echoes from a Moutanin School, collected by Seikyo Muchaku, 1953.)

There is no room to think about this in my world. I would rather you dis-
connect me, please, because I cannot entrap charred flesh, nor can I sign
with the brilliance of a thousand suns. Please deliver me from these
images among which I have erred and assembled. I cannot be Nikuko among
these older generations. Of kami, the eight million, I cannot say, but
sometimes they are translated as eight myriad and sometimes as eighty
million. Nanking, Nanking. Now, what is that, what is that?
