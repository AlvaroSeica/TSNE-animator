Stretch-Limo


Discomfort accompanies the stretching of skin, attached or unattached, the
skinning of animals, the disappearance of _sight,_ roar of pain; we belong
to ourselves, we _accompany_ ourselves. The skin of the body is a closed
manifold with a complex topology - but _closed,_ rounded; removed, the
skin possesses edges, boundaries - it becomes an _object_ for others, one-
self having disappeared in the act. Discomfort among the writing of this,
I consider the smoothness of the letters, yellow on a black background,
and Lauren Hutton and her guest in another background are discussing "sex-
y" men who have their skins upon them, the expression "the whole package" 
summarizing this section torn from the conversation. 

The splayed skin dis-plays striations, convolutions, curled affects, memo-
randa; the splayed skin invites warmth, wearing, tokens of death, fetishi-
zations, dis-embodiments, hysteria. 

Why is this so difficult to write about? The skin is _my_ skin, torn from
_my_ body; this is myself split, wired-up, sent elsewhere, placed in an
economy of capital and flesh. My body succumbs to the discomfort; under
the weather, it types with fingers trembling at the moment when the sym-
bolic becomes real, when the imaginary haunts the devastation of organs. 

The devastation is confirmed by history, embedded. Beyond that, the hori-
zon of the flesh is _such._

Silence greets the disaster.
