Jersey City Bombers


[Jersey City .jpgs to Cybermind only.]

In the United States north-east, the rust belt decays nervously, huge ma-
chines (industry.jpg) falling to pieces, representative of heavy industry
disappearing back into the world of purity and natural phenomena; just
across the street, a building surfaced with sheet-metal pipes is the home
of magick, tarot, future-spheres (pipebldg.jpg). Pipes shimmer in the
late-afternoon light, raw fields armed with the teeth of Argonauts lie
fallow nearby. 

Incipient mechanical power fleets ghostlike in the sky. The silence over-
whelms. The weight of tons has disappeared totally. Crucibles crash. The
world suffocates beneath violation fabric. 

Argonaut world without Medea, this silence thuds, machines, creaks, turns,
splits, shears, collapses under dead-weight. Medea's elsewhere on the air
there. You can't see her. She rouses herself beneath the weight of the
Hanged Man. She turns over, screeches; it's the sound of metal falling. 

The connection is broken temporarily; the computer _hangs._
