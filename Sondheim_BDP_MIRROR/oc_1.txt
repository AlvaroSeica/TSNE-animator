The Abacus, Infinite and Otherwise @ the Plaintext_Tools Zwki


Introduction to the file:

"This text file constitutes a series of small essays on the notion of the 
abacus. The abacus is unique since it is a digital instrument that exists 
within the analogic real; there is always room for error.

"The abacus constitutes a raster within the real. It can be constructed to 
any base; I consider an abacus to an infinite base. In this case, every 
number is a unique symbol.

"One can reverse this, in a sense, considering the application of analogic 
instruments to the digital domain. However since the latter is either a 
matter of abstract definition (i.e. definition within an abstract 
ontology) or a practical engineering application which is always already 
analogic, it might be a fairly useless exercise.

"I fear that some of the below may be naive; in any case, read on, and 
thank you for giving it some attention.

The Derailing of Metaphysics

The perfect wave of zero hertz is a constant current.
The perfect wave of infinite hertz tends towards white noise.
As the hertz increases, the sampling rate falls behind; think of
sin(tan(x)) for example near 90 deg. As the rate falls behind, a
symmetric pattern emerges around 90 deg.
The symmetric pattern is based on the points of intersection of the 
For sine or cosine waves, if the sampled wave is at any higher frequency 
than the sampling wave, patterns emerge. If the sampled wave is at any 
lower frequency than the sampler wave, patterns emerge.
If the sampled wave is irregular and the sampling wave is a greatly lower 
frequency, the resulting mapping is useless.
If the sampled wave is irregular and the sampling wave is infinite, the 
resulting mapping is identical to the sampled wave.
No wave is a perfect wave. 
The lower the hertz of course the greater the resonator.
Human consciousness is the wolf-note of the universe.
If the perfect wave of zero hertz intersects human consciousness,
the result is the irregularity of every-day life.
If the perfect wave of infinite hertz intersects human consciousness,
the result is the reproduction of human consciousness bereft of everyday 
life.
Bereft human consciousness is unintended, enlightened, a perfect wave of 
zero hertz.
The irregularity of every-day life is intended, unenlightened, a perfect 
wave of infinite hertz.
Any wave beyond the pure waves of zero or infinite hertz are impure.
Impure waves dirty the distinction between consciousness and every-day
life.
Impure waves dirty the distinction between yin and yang.
Only blurred distinctions are generative.
From generative distinctions, creativity.
From creative, perfect waves of zero and infinite hertz.
This is the regenerative principle of the noumen.
The regenerative principle co-exists with the continuous unfolding of 
time.
At the end of time, all waves are perfect waves of zero hertz.
At the beginning of time, all waves are perfect waves of infinite hertz.
We are living in the mid-time of dirtiness, impurity.
We dream the pure and the impure.
All dreamings are irregular and impure.
All dreamings are the railings of metaphysics.

Friendless in SpamGirlTown.

	Without friends, no one would want to live, even if he had all 
other goods. Is this sentence a SpamGirlTown sentence or is it a 
SpamGirlTown interval sentence or is this clause a SpamGirlTown clause or 
not a SpamGirlTown clause. Well I never did! Some of these statements are 
from SpamGirlTown. New girls job in our sight. Perhaps this statement is 
from SpamGirlTown.
	There used to be a real me, but I had it surgically removed. 
Sometimes I say to myself, yes, this is a SpamGirlTown statement, and you 
can easily guess which one, but then perhaps you can't.
 We keep the concept site of beauty and respect drive for our LOLLIES 
bodies. What does it matter if this were SpamGirlTown or not, and no, it's 
not just the second or the third statement after the first but perhaps the 
sentences that talk about the SpamGirlTown sentences.
	Bashfulness is an ornament to youth, but a reproach to old age. 
Great things are done when men and mountains meet. On one level this is 
perhaps a SpamGirlTown sentence but on a meta level this is clearly an 
about statement about SpamGirlTown because there are no girls in this 
sentence. This is not done by jostling in the street. Amazingly there are 
luscious breasts in this sentence even though it's not a SpamGirlTown 
sentence but it always makes you wonder. It's not a question of happiness, 
it's a requirement. For a meta-SpamGirlTown sentence to have a requirement 
it must have a SpamGirlTown-sentence subject. Consider the alternative. I 
am even though this is not SpamGirlTown and never was.

you'll whimper and you'll say < beneath the glass
"i want that good sweet coffee
i want it just right now
i'll sing this song so softly
i'll meditate on tao
get up talk a blue streak

ADA spherics modeling
                

                spherics

tending towards atmo(spherics) 
asymptotic analog to digital to analog mapping
sounds something like this on a busy night
this is _not_ a "natural" planetary resonance
but a carefully constructed mimicry which,
once finished, runs. 

http://www.as.wvu.edu:8000/clc/Members/sondheim/spheric/

  spherics|
    first item in spherics folder 
spherics sphericsb

2nd item. the work speaks for itself. 
have a fever slight headache. you can figure
out the whistlers, pops, grid hums

spherics sphericc

later. the formula uses 24 constants.
it's a question of continuous tuning.
everything narrows and comes into focus.
so there you are on a fifty-thousand mile
arc somewhere or other. 

spherics sphdelta

it's so close so easy to think one's taking
the pulse of the universe, it's just a computation
but it's the atmospheric world, you can hear everything
that goes on and everywhere. now and then there's a
storm and the world gets together.

spherics sphergimbal

the last as errancy dominates,
vagrancy? processes just above the earth's
surface in the grand scheme of things. 
taking the pulse of the universe, it's healthy,
we're not, goodbye.

jump cut

furious people cutting in, 
you are dancing, may I please cut in
thank you this is the way the binary works
we're on top of each other we've never met
one and another fingering here and there on keyboards
 brings happiness and furious people cutting in
there are many speeds of sound there are many lights
 there are many sounds many speeds of light
  always thinking about the medium it depends on the medium
you are very many frames do you know how many and between them
i am my svengali to my svengali i am my tribly to my trilby
may i please cut in this dance in mine

brief notes on my work


these starting going somewhere, the idea of wildly disparate style/media 
from one moment to the other - the idea of 'work' smeared across 'work' - 
coherency but no boundary - artificial transmissions by email and 
directory file - enonciation, enonce - 

then they went nowhere, what came to mind was 'particles emanating from 
the brain,' perhaps in honor of the granularity of microsound or the 
despair of a relatively cashless existence.

then they went somewhere with messy economics intersecting messy ontology, 
epistemological excretions. so for what they're worth, at this stage -

1 variety

the surface of my work is full of inconsistency. styles change abruptly; 
characters that were used were used up; new characters appear at times, 
only to disappear, to write in the background. media change from text to 
audio/video/image/web/performance and back again; the kernel coheres. i am 
bored and probably bore easily; i investigate the domain of the symbolic 
from the viewpoint of messiness, and messiness from the symbolic. codes 
and languaging are always in the background, disseminated, dissimulated.

2. orders

natural which leaks through manageriality; abjection which smears and 
devolves into incoherency; aphasias and disorders of the real; brute and 
insistent protocols; sexualities, acculturations, languagings of the body; 
materiality of mathematical idealities; idealities of physical materiali- 
ties; the economics and political economics of the symbolic, abstraction, 
the geographic - all of these are subjects of my work, just as my work is 
subject to their fragile and monarchic domains. 

3. quantity and distribution

no distribution, no quantity is infinite. the phenomenological horizon of 
distribution is commonality of usage. distributivity is unobtainable. art 
is a praxis is a practice. quantity is also a shearing-away, habit and 
habitus. my work is a nudge. it won't survive the net. 

4. common themes

the theme of the hardening and collapse of the symbolic. the theme of 
attempting to grasp the infinite. the theme of the 'otherwise.' the 
argument against totalization. the violence of totalization. the code and 
the broken code. inhabiting the broken. the broken and the disaster. 

5. staying with it

if you stay with it, it will come, sensate. if you begin anywhere, you can 
end anywhere. of what conceivable purpose would be a conclusion? a history 
perhaps, a phenomenology of that history, a rocky landscape stumbled over. 
i'd say it works in your brain, but that's presumptuous. i'd say it works 
in mine, but that's symptomology. tropes, symptoms cross-reference, you'll 
see. code is cross-reference. you might not want to stay with it. it might 
never come.

The Power Vacuum / Vacuum Power


"In 1975, within a small but important cultural institution, a small group 
of men laid down the law." (Alan Sondheim)

Front cover: Stark: white letters on black background:

"THE ESSENTIAL CINEMA: / Essays on the films / in the collection of /
Anthology Film Archives /// edited by P. Adams Sitney ///// Volume One //
Anthology Film Archives Series 2"

This is the _essential_ cinema in 1975, chosen by committee, unified in a 
singular volume, published by the New York University Press. The myth is
at work as the 'avant-garde' establishes not only its 'manifesto' (Sitney)
- but also its absolute canon, however "open" to present and future 
inclusion.

Spine: Stark: black letters on white background. Of note:

The _Washington Square Arch_ logo at the base, with this marriage:

"New York University Press and Anthology Film Archives." In addition of 
course: "THE ESSENTIAL CINEMA / P. Adams Sitney, ed."

Archives: Already doing the reader's work. This _essential_ collection is 
permanent and permanently institutionalized; these are the films _that 
will survive._

Back cover: Stark: black letters on white background. Of note:

"Anthology Film Archives is unique among the cinematheques of the world in 
that it selects, preserves, and exhibits a body of essential films which 
attempts to define the art of film-making. _The Essential Cinema_ combines 
some of the polemical, critical, and scholarly activities of Anthology 
Film Archives in book form." 

Absent from the film list: Antonioni, Godard, Bergmann, Fellini. Present 
in great profusion: Brakhage (never mind that he was apparently part of 
the "initial committee" that included Mekas, Sitney, Kubelka, and Kelman. 
Later Broughton came in and it looks like Brakhage got bounced. Ten of 
Broughton's films are essential. Thirty-eight of Brakhage's are. Bunuel 
gets four, Chaplin eight, Buster Keaton three (one of which is a 'prog- 
ram'), Griffith the usual two (forget The Wind), Edison none, Bresson 
seven, Cornell ten, Eisenstein four, you get the idea. This is the cinema 
of cinema, although:

"Within the scale of avantgarde sensibilities there is a wide divergence 
among these five men. However, they are a principle: that a high art of 
film emerges primarily when its artists are most free." And: "The 
curriculum it (The Essential Cinema) provides constitutes a film history 
for a student and aspiring film-maker who wants to know the medium as an 
_asethetic endeavor._ Within the range of film as an art Anthology Film 
Archives attempts to leave out one of the most sublime achievements."

The language smacks of connoisseurship: "avantgarde, high, free, aesthetic 
endeavor, sublime." Gender and class are absent, as is - not only Holly- 
wood (for which a case might be made, i.e. already over-exposed and 
overtly manipulative) - but also, as noted, Godard for example, Antonioni 
for another - and that in spite of the latter's trilogy, and the former's 
furious and deconstructive assaults on cinema, culture, ideology, war. 
Also absent of course - any sign of pornography or erotic filmmaking (one 
might include Deren's Meshes but hardly and barely), although the 
so-called art or blue films dating back at least through the 20s exhibit 
many of the characteristics of "free" as well as deconstructive narrative 
(let's get it over with, let's let it fall apart).

Not only connoisseurship, but Deren, Menken, and a few others notwith- 
standing, males dominate; both initial and final committee had no women, 
or minorities (although "Lithuanian" might pass). What passes for freedom 
comes within and beneath the aegis of power; what might be a discursive 
formation is transformed into a monolithic and exclusionary canon. No 
wonder that "art film" was at a loss before feminism; it remained bound on 
one hand to a fairly traditional poetics of film (or a traditional poetics 
that was new within film, to give it its due), ad on the other to a 
neutralized simulacrum of downer culture with Warhol's stases. To be sure 
_at that time_ the excitement was there, but it was the excitement of an 
old boy's club, which still dominates cultural worlds in one form or 
another. It would appear to some of us that, in order to be "free," the 
essential would be always already problematized - and that the _words_ 
"free" and "freedom" were questionable from the start, as ideological 
formations. This is the difficulty with any manifesto whatsoever - funny, 
furious, revolutionary, tongue-in-cheek: it's an indication, if not an 
_implication_ (in the sense of _implicated_) of believers - it carries far 
too much baggage, and its potential anti-authoritarianism is also the 
greatest authoritarianism conceivable, since other positionings are 
relegated to the differend.

(For example, where is video? Are materialities, diegetic experimentation, 
real-time, confined at this early date to film? Kathy Acker and Alan 
Sondheim had completed their work; Nam June Paik had been around for 
decades; Acconci and many other artists had worked in video and short film 
for that matter; Ron Michaelson and others abroad had produced amazing 
work. Clearly the "film-world" was a thing apart; from the officiated 
viewpoint of the Anthology, "avantgarde" went only so far. "Free," yes, 
but "free" within the bounds of medium, genre, and habitus; nothing else 
would do, was even possible. To some extent, Jack Smith crossed over into 
performance - that was it. Smith rates three in the film list.)

This book, which contains mind you wondrous essays, represents both the 
hope and downfall of the "avantgarde": just when you thought you could 
breathe again, the air disappears...

                                                      - Jennifer Lopez

Living, Will You


If I am incapacitated and my eyes no longer wander across your body, no 
longer look into yours, kill me.

If I am in numbing pain, and looking into your eyes, and cannot speak, and 
you will know, I cannot think, kill me.

If I am to be sent to an old age home, that concentration-camp portal into 
death, kill me, do not force a waiting.

If I am useless, can no longer work or think, kill me, and if my work is 
poor or repetitive, and I do not know, and I struggle uselessly, kill me 
as well.

If I cannot control my body or its functions, if you are disgusted, if you 
are living in sad memories, kill me, let the memories live.

If you must watch the slow consuming havoc of cancer, the spread of body 
against body, as we have all watched, kill me, I would not contaminate the 
living.

If the world turns fascist to a greater degree, if you hear the final 
knock at the door, kill me; know I will not be able to withstand.

If I beg you, kill me, without that flat dry voice when the world 
dissolves for one last and silent time, kill me.

And if you tire of me, if the world tires, if I am pest or nuisance, if I 
am cornered thing, or spectacle, or antiquated and irrelevant, of course 
kill me, of course kill me.

       Blip

    Blip The Digital Game by Tommy appeared in 1977-78 (Japan). It was 
based on Pong and similar early computer games. There are three buttons on 
each side; when the "ball" comes towards one of them, the player presses 
that particular button (if she can) to send it back. The ball is actually 
an LED, and the entire game is mechanical, complete with a wind-up knob. 
It takes two batteries for the LED. Blip is quite difficult to play; 
Foofwa d'Imobilite told me he had one as a child and loved it. The 
mechanism that moves the LED back and forth is hidden behind dark plastic; 
only the red light shines through. This is an early analog mimicry of an 
early digital game based on analog ping-pong. The type-face is close to 
the same font used by early card-readers. So here is a mapping, which, by 
virtue of the noise embodied in the hidden mechanism, seems actually 
harder to play than its digital counterpart. It's a bit eerie, given the 
later development of handhelds. I hope, by virtue of this video, to give 
you some idea of the excitement of the simulacra of early gaming, as well 
as stimulate a vigorous debate on the relationship of digital and analogic 
phenomena to the exigencies of flesh.

Stunning original copy of the debut LP by Alan Sondheim's Ritual All 770, 
released in 1967 on Riverboat, the same label as John Fahey's The 
Transfiguration of Blind Joe Death. "The Songs" is comprised of one long 
improvisation by Sondheim (electric guitar, violin, flute, suling 
[Indonesian flute], xylophone, alto sax, classical guitar, clarinet, 
shenhai [Indian oboe], bass recorder, mandolin, so-na [Chinese oboe], 
Hawaiian guitar, koto, sopranino recorder, chimta [Indian percussion, cor 
anglais, sitar, bansari [Indian flute]) along with Barry Sugarman (tabla, 
dholak [Indian hand drums] and naquerro [Moroccan kettledrums]), Chris 
Matthewson (bass), Robert Poholek (trumpet, cornet), Ruth Ann Hutchinson 
(vocal), June Fellows (vocal) and J.Z. (aka Rafi Zabor, see below) (jazz 
drums). An all-time classic of the avant underground, ESP-Disk went on to 
put out two records under Sondheim's name and the group was name-checked 
by Nurse With Wound. This album has never been reissued in any form and is 
exceedingly RARE!

Cover is in excellent condition for its age (37 years) though the edges 
are discolored. There is some wear at the corners but all seams are very 
strong. Vinyl is MINT- and appears to be unplayed.

From the Washington Post in 1998:

"Any tour of Rafi Zabor's apartment includes a prominent stop in the 
bathroom. The ceiling has a hole the size of a Buick, which ordinarily 
would be noteworthy enough. But what really draws attention is the fact 
that the bathtub faucet is gushing hot water.

You say all faucets do that? Yes, but this one is broken, which means the 
water has been going nonstop for several months now. It was born as a 
drip, became a trickle, and by now is a full-fledged torrent.

Just as the modest Colorado River carved the mighty Grand Canyon, the 
water from this faucet has, over time, made its presence felt. The 
porcelain where the water hits the tub has worn away, revealing underneath 
a dark, chalky material. This bodes further trouble, but Zabor, who says 
he can't get the super to do anything, is curiously unworried.

"It's every Turk's dream to have a fountain in his home," he says. While 
Zabor is not Turkish, he's fond of the country. The fact that it's hot 
water is a plus. The Turks also are partial to hammans, the steamy 
communal baths.

Why, Zabor suddenly realizes, he's living out a Turkish fantasy right here 
in deepest Brooklyn! "I've got it all," he says.

True enough. Forget about the funky apartment have we mentioned the way 
the bedroom wall seeps moisture whenever there's a rainy wind from the 
east? and concentrate on the good news: Zabor's first novel, "The Bear 
Comes Home," will be presented the PEN/Faulkner Award at a gala ceremony 
at the Folger Shakespeare Library on Saturday night. With the award comes 
enough money to afford a plumber, $15,000."

Rock


fuck this didn't go anywhere it's not sounded

be fame / Ashley Bickerton was having a show and Mary Boone said to me 
that the artists were the rock stars today. Mary Boone was a student of 
mine and opened the most famous 80s gallery in Soho and she still has a 
gallery. I haven't seen Mary in years. Chris Frantz or was it Franz and 
Tina Weymouth were students of mine. Al Wilson was a close friend of mine 
until he was Canned Heat, sometimes I hear his goin down the highway or 
was it another song I think he was called the owl then. We used to play 
together. I tried to play with the Talking Heads when they were The 
Artistics or was it the Artistics. Kathy Acker and I made a terrific tape 
together. I was on the stage with Bob Dylan at Carnegie Hall but I was 
really part of the audience. I knew Son House but not well. David Salle 
told me his style wasn't my style or was my style not his style. I'm 
desperate for fame, I'm a star fucker. I watched Vito Acconci and Laurie 
Anderson swell into greatness and I used to call them Vito and Laurie and 
I thought I was in love with Laurie when I was running around with Vito's 
ex-wife. Don Munroe or was it Monroe was a student of mine and then ran 
Andy Warhol's Fifteen Minutes on MTV. Nicole Miller the fashion designer 
was a student of mine, so was the artist Tyler Stallings and I knew Marvin 
Minsky slightly but not well enough to call him Marvin. I met Guattari in 
Paris and I might have called him Felix, Mark someone who translated was 
also there. I met Trinh Minh Ha and Gayatri Spivak at a friend's house at 
different times. But back to the rock stars. My drummer was Rafi Zabor who 
later wrote The Bear Comes Home and made a lot of money and got a lot of 
attention why he was even on the radio. I heard the Ramones and of course 
Talking Heads and Blondie from the very beginning but only the Talking 
Heads or The Talking Heads knew me. Rock's got that edge that goes on and 
off stage, it's furious, we're all lame walking around programming, it's a 
different thing, not even like Coleman Hawkins. I met John Fahey who loved 
my playing but didn't take the tape. I knew Bernie Stollman who took both 
records. I heard Mel Lyman many times, maybe he had his cult then. Geoff 
Muldaur too, but it was mainly Al Wilson. I was backstage at the Newport 
Folk Festival with the blues guys. I was a city blues player, whatever 
happened to Tim someone who was better but I was wilder. I. A. Richards 
liked my freshman year poetry I wrote at Brown University. I lived with 
Clark Coolidge and Aram Saroyan, but let's get back to rock, I knew Marty 
Mull fairly well. This is the only real there is, the real that takes the 
body, that names the body it takes. We're all going there, we're all 
wanting furiously to go there, we'd drop everything else in an instant if 
the doors were opened. I was within three feet of Janis Joplin at her 
cafeteria concert at RISD. I knew a lot of artists but they were artists, 
they weren't on stage. I still play guitar faster than anyone I know, but 
it's weirder, avant-garde, and no one plays with me, I've gone solo. It's 
my axe and I've had gigs. What about Maria Muldaur, she sent chills up 
down my spine. I yelled at Derrida, he had a bevy of academia hangers-on 
or I'd like to say hanger-ons. But I didn't envy Derrida the way I envied 
Tina Weymouth, and I never will. For she had what he'd never had and 
couldn't understand, why he'd fall flat trying to have it.

"Is it just a need to make an adolescent dream come true?" Adolescent 
dreams are our last _true_ dreams, the furious sexual psycho emotional 
onslaught we spend the rest of our lives recuperating. You're _in_ rock, 
you're _in_ rockstar mode, or any _music_ mode that devours you. "Is it an 
urge to become more pop(ular)?" No, it's got nothing to do with that 
_thing_ which is always already elsewhere, that _thing_ that dominates as 
you grow older, turns into finance, economy, that _thing_ that becomes a 
matter/mass of calculation. It's inside, it's the movement of the body, 
the _twitch,_ what happens to the marrow of the bone and mind. "To reach a 
greater audience than the (net)art consumers?" To inhere that energy, 
injest it, to _move_ with it as a _tree_ moves or a _demon_ moves, to fuck 
god, not deny him or her or it, to swallow god, to turn the _thing_ 
upside-down. "Is it a throw at reintroducing pleasure in art producing?",
its dance is the dance of pleasure-production, it leaves you behind, it's 
dragging the body with it, it's tethered to the body, it's exaltation, "Is 
it about making the body on the screen?", there's _no body,_ there's no 
_body,_ there's no _screen,_ there's no screen _memory,_ there's nothing 
at work, there's nothing at play, the words take you away, the words wrest 
you from them, "About taking control of the body of the word?", not on 
_your life_ when the word grabs you with the knife, when your skin _sears_ 
Peter's rock, when ecstasy makes you hear and there ready for anything 
that comes along, you swallow _anything,_ Jesus, Mary, Muhammed, Buddha, 
Marx, you swallow _anything,_ Confucius, Derrida, Bush, idi Amin, Gandhi, 
"Is it to escape from the emerging net art production patterns?" but what 
patterns when your body can't do but the walk the walk can't do but the 
talk the talk, it's not belief, "Is it because we believe 21st century 
rock stars will emerge from the net?", it's not cause of belief, it's the 
living sound of the world, the sound in which, as in every sound, the 
sound in which _matter vibrates,_ in which you can only _hear the things 
in the world,_ in which all existence is _the murmur of the world,_ and 
you're doing it, you're doing it, you're doing it -

all tied up in star-fuck skein, in fuck-me-you skein, in fuck-you-me 
skein, in terror-bombing-paradise skein, is sweet-talking pillow-soft 
skein, in folded skein, stretched taut skein, in ready-to-break skein, in 
crying-broken skein, in your skein-skin, in her skein-skin, in his 
skein-skin, 

when _I sing_ my body makes a noise, there's nothing else, just air that 
does it, the air that lives me, it's that matter, it's all microsound, the 
body's no beginning, no ending, a bridge or a structure, flesh and its 
muffled motion, just as a wave is the wave of a grain, just as a particle 
is the feel of its wave <

Anyway so is it this, the body/movement/fame/sex/langue/truth/teen/wave no 
not at all, it's the plan-out screech-wave, it's the cool theory David 
Byrnes wave, I couldn't play with him, I didn't hear the chords, I was 
going elsewhere, a total fuckup failure, I wanted _it_ so bad I could 
taste _it._

I use laptop, a lot of us do, it projects, you can get into it, sound/ 
projection, whatever, you can fuck up, you can't fuck up, it's all there, 
it's the screen-world, it's confined by your patches, well whatever you've 
done to it, whatever you've put _there_

like Diamanda Galas or Gallas how can I remember or Annie being a bad girl 
or Clements tilted or the other where Shulgin makes the screen the star 
and there's that economics again but it's after the fact, the spectators 
are _moving_

There's a big split between construction constructibility, building the 
grain-wave, and the flesh devouring, the grain-fuck wave-fuck, but they 
cum together when the sound begins

but like when you play your axe and you're moving so fast and you lose 
track of your arms your hands your fingers it's just the sound coming out 
of you or being you but everywhere, no time to ask

"Why is there being rather than nothing?"

I want to _taste_ it, it's almost always 4/4 time, this constant _cutting_ 
into time, the other signatures are clever, superfluous, place half here, 
half there, begin again, or cut, it doesn't have to be a half, just use 
the haft of the axe, cut again, it can't go on forever, you hear around 22 
notes/second or play that, of course they're exceptions, 

old difference between Lydia Lunch and Janis Joplin living on or in

the earthquake

this really happened this evening in california
and then i made it happen everywhere
http://www.asondheim.org/earthquake.jpg
i'm getting sick of images
this one is particularly large
for which i send my apologies for the details
which somehow seemed necessary even though
the file swelled inconceivably

i apologize and will try for better entertainment

if you are still hoping i will do something good
i know you are on my side
i will make it happen someday and yes
and yes i try and try and try and someday

please do not give up hope
i can only offer you this now
but better things are coming

please be patient
the patient is resting

after the earthquake

' full demand'

no no no no no
i demand that you show my work 
you need to show my work if you don't show my work i'll die
no no no not that way
i demand you show my work because of its merit not that i want to live
i'm not sure i want to live anyway and i don't want to live if you don't
 show my work
no no no no why would you want to show my work that way
i want you to show my work this way 
i want the frame i need the frame there must be silence
there must be silence surrounding my work silence inhabits my work
without silence my work is noise and nothing but noise
with silence there is the anticipation of my work and the memory of my 
 work
my work my work my work it's all about my work
i want my work shown with a very high ceiling an invisible high ceiling
shown with a dark black and in fact invisible floor 
you're suspended between nothing visible and nothing visible
and yes of course nothing to the left and nothing to the right
and so much time that there is nothing before and there is nothing after
nothing but my work work work
no no no no no i demand you show my work my work not that way my work
 just this way just this way and no other
i demand you show my work in any case no no no no no no no just my work
just my work in any case
i want my work shown with no one entering and no one leaving
shown with no one entering before my work and no one leaving after my work
no no no no no no no no no not that way not that way at all
just this way nothing above nothing below nothing before nothing after
nothing left and nothing right no no no not that not that way 
i demand you show my work

Memorial


Allen Ginsberg or Kathy Acker or Robert Creeley dies and the lists swell 
with memorials, ephemera, anecdotes, quotations, odes, forwards, from 
friends, strangers, almost always loving, sometimes websites are created, 
people might travel a little bit in real life, people cry, tears are 
written, the swelling grows, levels, subsides, the loss is present, some 
might say ever-present, others sutured over, it's moment's like these that 
lists, communities, online and offline, come together, at least appear to

We're all vulnerable, we all wait our turn in the wings for our memorial, 
our moment, of passing, the whisper which fades, can only fade, in this 
most fragile of media, these archives that disappear as well, without 
memorial, passing comments at best

Before the Net, what then?, rumors, telephone calls, almost always one to 
one immediately, then perhaps the newspaper or radio announcements, if one 
is sufficiently famous, perhaps a gathering at St. Mark's or other space 
turned place for memorials, always carried in memory, not even the arc-
hive, someone might have made a video of the event, or an audio, anything, 
but not publicly accessible, now online the archives are there, present, 
naked to anyone, susceptible to hacking, damage, but at least momentarily 
present, at least the denouement

What will happen to us, to me, when the words cease and others suture in, 
or at least one hopes for the suturing, the swollen and marked, remarked, 
residue, communal ripples, there

Or as lists increasingly list, to the side of the dead, thanatotic, encom- 
iums, tottered graves, true memorials of eternal battered words, the dead 
praising the dead, the graves full from one end of the infinite Net to the 
other, guarded against intrusion, archives infinitely duplicated, words 
presenting at the last judgment

Thomas Browne and a quincunx of urns in his honour

Lance Armstrong and the hearts of his fellow countrymen and women

i am master of time split and time formed
foofwa sttudder time of the alphabet
*/ http://www.asondheim.org/foofwaroofcurl.mov of dictionary time 20^ /*
but this does not eliminate the sadness
of the death of wilderness and mutilated bodies of women and children
but here is a beautiful body shuttering for you in dictionary one two time
yes here is a beautiful body sttuddering for you in one two time
there is no time for thinking on the killing floor
no time of meditation no time of silence
the camera cuts into the flesh-time of beautiful bodies
knives slice elsewhere and i am sad so sad with nightmares
that i would be happy on the tortured graves of the mutilators
that i would be content with the hacking of limbs of torturers
and the blinding of evil of torturers by the mutilated
evil, you will not find me, nor me nor the camera
evil, you will wander awkward and clumsy, your time sliced inconceivably
sadness you are my master of blind and crippled time
sadness you are my master of split time and time formed
sadness you are the master of evil too
