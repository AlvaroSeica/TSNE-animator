Pascal, Cybermind


[...] I have never judged anything in exactly the same way. I cannot 
judge a work of art while doing it. I must do as painters do and stand 
back, but not too far. How far then? Guess. ...

_Thinking reed._ It is not in space that I must seek my human dignity, 
but in the ordering of my thought. It will do me no good to own land. 
Through space the universe grasps me and swallows me up like a speck; 
through thought I grasp it.

We run heedlessly into the abyss after putting something in front of us 
to stop us seeing it.
/166

The eternal silence of these infinite spaces fills me with dread.
