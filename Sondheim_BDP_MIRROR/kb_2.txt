tremble at the vestiges of culture. To comprehend lag and make all
necessary decisions. To decide to do. To recognize the security of
unknown languages, ideograms. To become other within oneself. Not to
tremble at the presence of this other. To refuse to recognize oneself
in a mirror or photograph. To hear the call of the name and not re-
spond. To refuse to call. To be effaced and silent. To make no dif-
