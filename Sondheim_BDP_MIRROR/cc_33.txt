Resistance


Of course it is the resistance _to end._

What I need to say here resists, in a manner of speaking, a manner of
typing, that is to say, a resistance to speaking: the implacable use of
the keyboard, the resistance of the keys themselves, the necessity of
continuous checking of the textual domain - its appearance, spelling,
punctuation... A resistance which is also a form of organization of
course, an organization-coursing through/emblematic of, thought, as it is
constrained, framed by the text - it is this framing that _naturally_
constitutes the transmission or domain of thought, its reification. 

Which is not _thought,_ or thought thought, but an articulation or pro- 
tocol, thinking channeled into specific linguistic structures.

It is also the appearance of the _thing,_ of the paragraph, spacing, that
can make all the difference in the world. Resistance structures / restruc-
tures; every text, in fact, is simultaneously resistance and empowerment
- _not_ in an inverse relationship, but otherwise, in collusion... 

It is the resistance of the keys against the fingers, the resistance of 
habits of thought against the novelty of new sentencing (one is sentenced 
_to_ novelty), and it is the resistance of the mind itself to a reifica- 
tion harboring the very germs of novelty. It is the necessity to submit 
to novelty; the necessity to continue the struggle with the arms, the 
wrists, the palms, the joints, the tips; and the necessity of resistance 
itself as language ceases its noise, resonates with the specificity of 
the indexical/phonemic.

It is of course the resistance to _begin._
