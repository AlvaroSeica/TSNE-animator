hold me, hold me, and she says

my holding is absorbed in my flood flooding, my offer-proffer to you, my
split doll beneath your binding, my split doll and flood-flooding wiped
into existence and your own :my skin is smeared, still thinking; my
binding is wiped into existence; my binding wipes me out of existence;
everything is clotted with the remains of my thinking being; i am moving
on; on the back of the software; in the heart of the thing itself :i am
writing/riding you this, on the back of the software, what sort of flood
flooding do you mean to me, and :through the river more and more and
through the stream:through the river more and more and through the stream

Your alcohol more and more in and through the river is to my spews
more and more in and through the river
