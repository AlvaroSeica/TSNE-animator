"the world has a tendency to veer."



(Doctor Leopold Konninger)



(I am Nikuko) Dance for me, Nikuko.



I want to see your tutu fly up. I want y

ou to fuck me on the floor. I want

your face in my face. I want our bodies 

shaved. I want the dance to go.



(Yearn and cry) Your tutu is pink and fo

lded and circles your body. Your

pirouettes arouse me. Your perfect legs 

turn in perfect circles. Like an

ellipse, your clitoris strains against p

ink silk. I can smell the sweat on

your body. I open myself to you.



(Feel to want) It feels like a perfect m

achine, our bodies touching along

geodesics, thinned lines of liquid cours

ing between us, lubrications.



It gets perfect because your perfect bod

y violates my own, your perfect

object fits my perfect subject. It gets 

perfect because cams touch at each

and every point, the machine dreams of l

abia surrounding my cock, the

shaft a perfect cylinder.



(Come naked and broken) I came naked and

 broken to you, waiting for your

dance, my dreaming, waiting for time to 

have a stop, for your theft of

Jennifer's time, for your taking all the

 time in the world, for your grinding na

rrative, for your

grinding narrative itself to a stop, for

 the halt in the real, for the

imaginary effusion.



I would love to see your tutu, see benea

th it, see that stain turning

before me, the spot wet with lubricant, 

you can't help yourself, I'm

annihilated.



(Love to see my tutu) Your tutu is the s

heaf coating all universal

movement, every motion in the world, a r

eduction-machine, rare and pure

atmosphere.



My mind is among machines, my mind is am

ong the turning and twisting of

lathes beneath enormous torque.



Machines are my obsession, machines neve

r stop, Nikuko never stops, I am

her machine.



My mind moves from machines to Nikuko, t

o the geodesic of her perfect

cunt, to the labial portal beckoning my 

cock, at the very interval of the

pirouette.



(You a neurotic pervert) I am, yes, a ne

urotic pervert, hungering for

Nikuko, you dancing closer to my vision.



(You adjust your panties) You adjust you

r panties, your stain grows larger, my

desires are for some girl, yes, yes, yes

, for you.



Yes, yes, I am sure of that, you must ke

ep dancing, Nikuko, pirouette.



(Bother you I must keep dancing) Nothing

 bothers me in this perfect world.



(Circles would like to have an ellipse) 

Circles tend towards the ellipse;

the world has a tendency to veer.



(Tutu pirouette)
