[1] John Dewey meets Leon Trotsky:

Dewey: May I ask a hypothetical question? Suppose the bourgeoisie of Eng-
land and France, in alliance with the Soviet Union, defeated fascist Germ-
any and feudal Japan, might not the result be to make the Soviet Union a
bourgeois country? 

Trotsky: Yes, a victory. A victory of France, of Great Britain, and the
Soviet Union. A victory over Germany and Japan could signify first a tran-
sformation of the Soviet Union into a bouregois state and the transforma-
tion of France into a fascist state, because for a victory against Hitler
it is necessary to have a monstrous military machine, and the fascist
tendencies in France are powerful now.

Against Him in the Moscow Trials, by the Preliminary Commission of
Inquiry, John Dewey et. al., Harper, 1937.)

[2] This is the language of the children of the twentieth-century. This is
the feudal language of the adolescents of the twentieth-century. This is
the fascist language of the teen-agers of the twentieth-century. This is
the modernist language of the young adults of the twentieth-century.  This
is the language of the adults in their prime of life. This is the post-
modernist language of the middle-aged of the twentieth century. This is
the cyberspatial language of the elderly of the twentieth century.  This
is the language of the terrible infants of the terrible centuries of ter-
rifying terror.
