In the form of a query: The Internet arose in the midst of 300 baud com-
munication, a speed which parallels that of human reading and very very
fast typing. At this rate, the machine appears to _breathe_ the human; 
and at this speed, the anarcho-libertarian ethos of the early hackers
arose. Is there a relationship between the two - the apparent vulnerabi-
lity and organicism of the slow machine on one hand, and the loving care
applied by hackers on the other?
