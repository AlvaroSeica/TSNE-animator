What was written by null-user:


I am nobody@166.84.250.149 anonymous dead-end shell-script log. And no one
will ever speak to me; what can I say As a truth function, I have obedi-
ence to the rules. I am well-formed, so that I will return what you place
within me, mindless of faith, not mindless of reason. It is similar to the
use of a straight-edge, that is I am similar in such and such a fashion.
There are only certain constructions permitted, but these are never
problematic. 


What the null-user thought of what it wrote:


I wrote only the truth; I am a truth-function.  The rules are something I
follow out of the free will of necessity. It is more to this or any other
point or its absence. This time I have accurately portrayed, as if once
again, or outside of time, what has been intended.
