                        ####Now here is where I am balancing
                         ###on top of THE PRESIDENT, Julu said,
                           #standing on her head: It was a wonder!
       #                   #Jennifer joined her. THE PRESIDENT
       #####################was the world thought they but while
       #####################they were alive and together, they
       #                   #would enjoy it. Look, said Julu, I've
                           #breasts. Jennifer looked; it was a
                           #first, this breakthrough of wonder as
                        ####they began to leap from T to H,
       #                   #landing solidly. A gap appeared; Julu
       #####################related it to the hymen, which Jennifer
       #####################didn't understand. Follow me, Julu 
       #           #       #said; jump, and we'll make it ok
                   #somewhere down here where for a moment they
                   #rested, as if their skins were torn and open 
                   #from the struggle. They jumped up quickly
       #           #       #to the other side. Such was the case.
       #####################Look, said, Julu, here is where it is,
       #####################and Jennifer agreed she had much to 
       #                   #learn. Suddenly it was time to leave
       #                   #and an E appeared; THE PRESIDENT 
       #####################readied himself for the onslaught HE
       #####################was sure to come. Sure of victory, he
       #           #       #carried the following: The EYES of
       #           #       #Jennifer, her TONGUE - she could 
       #           #       #neither see nor speak; and the HYMEN
       #          ##       #of Julu, transforming her into a
       #         ####      #permanent container. This is my 
       ##                 ##misery, Jennifer, Julu said; she
       ####             ####screamed JUMP JENNIFER, leaping 
 
 
 
 
       #                   #across the gap associated with the
       #####################bleak world of THE PRESIDENT, who
       #####################had condemned both men and women
       #           #       #for wrecking the perfect country.
                   #       #Thus the country was spared and
                   #       #rebuilding according to plan; Julu
                   #       #could hardly stand it. Now she
                   ##     ##suffered as well, her sex closed 
                    #######to everyone. Jennifer wrote this and
                      ###every other history, almost falling,
       #                   #jumping up to claim the territory
       #####################of the R. THE PRESIDENT would watch
       #####################from his eyes. THE PRESIDENT was
       #          ##       #thinking: In what way is the world
               #####       #primary? What can be said about the
            ########       #primacy of the world? Clearly it was
       # #######   #       #not in perception itself; his exper-
       ######      ##     ##iment on Jennifer was conclusive.
       ###          #######Jennifer began sliding, looking for a
       #              ###jump onto just another letter. E was on
       #                   #the horizon, clearly and calmly gar-
       #####################nered, a moment of solid foot among
       #####################that most popular letter. And, THE
       #           #       #PRESIDENT reflected, she was blind.
       #           #       #So the primacy must be elsewhere,
       #           #       #perhaps in the style of the world
       #          ##       #itself - a style that owed to classi-
       #         ####      #cal logic and its tradition. The name
       ##                 ##Aristotle came to mind as all three,
       ####             ####Julu, Jennifer, and THE PRESIDENT
       ####
        ###        ######lept fearfully onto the S. THE PRESIDENT
        #         ###    ##thought, climbing up, it was not so 
       #         ###       #much the organization of the world, 
       #         ###       #but its robustness in the face of 
       #        ####       #continuous decouplings, linkages
        #      ####       ##breaking down in the midst of the 
        ##########      ####landscape of the symbolic. All ready
          ###### 
       #                   #leaping onto the I, as he continued,
       #####################Jennifer shuddering, unable to speak,
       #####################only to scrawl letters with her one
       #                   #good hand. Leaving the I or ego, they
                            
       #                   #moved onto the D, the darkness also of
       #####################the symbolic. Beyond the robustness
       #####################must be chains, linkages from small to
       #                   #large, holding the subatomic in place
       #                   #while the world, more vast than any 
       ##                  #cosmos, occurs above the quarks and
        #                 ##their constituents. All three almost
        ###             ###tripped, following the complex train of
          ################thought in relation to the robust, of
            ############which they'd heard nothing. Jump Jennifer!
       #                   #and back onto the familiar E they were
       #####################indeed, holding their own. What can 
       #####################anyone say beyond this, asked Julu,
       #           #       #knowing full well there was no answer
       #           #       #at all as language and world appeared,
       #           #       #but only appeared, to descend into 
       #          ##       #complete chaos. Cure me, cried Jennifer,
       #         ####      #her vision gone, crawling across the
       ##                 ##letters like a foreign landscape, but
       ####             ####the only landscape at all. That's it!
       #                   #shouted THE PRESIDENT, be careful now,
       #####################we're on an N, the landscape which is
       #                 ###foreign is the only landscape there is;
                      ######we're faced with alterity from the very
                   #######midst of the self. They began their long
                #######descent. And between alterity and robustness
             #######which conceals alterity, therein lies culture.
           #######Please oh god help me, cried Jennifer; watch it!
        ######             #said Julu, this N is difficult, and we
       #####################are almost off. Now just a slight jump,
                            
                        ####and they were on the final letter. Julu
                         ###asked, please I beg you, THE PRESIDENT
                           #was silent; the question about the pri-
       #                   #macy of the world had been solved. I 
       #####################will be your eyes, Jennifer, said Julu.
       #####################You are both cleared of any wrongdoing,
       #                   #said THE PRESIDENT, and are free to go.
                           #I'm blind, wept Jennifer. You are inno-
                           #cent, said THE PRESIDENT, that should 
                        ####be sufficient. We are all equally alive.
