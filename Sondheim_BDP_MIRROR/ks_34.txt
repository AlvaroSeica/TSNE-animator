all channels off the air here in NYC, only channel 2 surviving. only news
2 and the rest of the set filled with snow, as if there were no city out-
side, nothing but electric coming in, filling the box with noise. someone
told me the noise is that of the universe; certainly it's stochastic, not
chaotic, deeply random fluctuations of the world exhibited as gritty ras-
ter. turn the dials and snow succeeds snow, sometimes faint lines appear-
ing, ghost-like - other cities, countries, planets, honing in on the aer-
ials. the box is mute, white noise from the speakers; one forgets channel
2 as others begin to flicker into virtual life. the fcc has ordained this
test carried across the aether for several hours; my hand trembles before
the dials as I try to bring coherency back, communication to life, within
the parameters of the screen. just the glimpse of a face speaking quickly
in my direction; I'd harbor dreams forever. this is the truth of communi-
cation, extruded momentarily from noise, succumbing once again - as Jenn-
ifer might succumb, lost and wandering forever in forgotten memory. let's
not forget, then, the institutions, governmental, bureaucratic and offic-
ious, mainstays of the given world, creating the forms of our speakings -
and just as capable of taking them away. this 2:30 am, Jenn, Julu, Nikuko
and Alan, speaking from, beyond, and into, the void with dark permission.
