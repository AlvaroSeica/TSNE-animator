Voyeur(3)


Actions invert topologically in cyberspace, become extreme; cannibalism is
not uncommon, limbs entering limbs, sudden fistings followed by arms and
legs swallowed in holes opening up everywhere on naked writ(h) ing bodies.
Is there no limit! Cynthia cried, her full breasts, erect nipples, heaving
against Travis' enormous organ! 

A thin smile crossed his lips, as his head found her womb's lusciousness, 
and fully entered in a passionate replay of the birth process in reverse!

Fluids flow smoothly among unprotected lovers splayed wide for sprays of
eternal cum, sweat, menses, tears, piss, shit, lymph, saliva. Lovers bathe
in one another's liquids, effluvia, debris, lubrications, vomits, pounding
terminal glass uselessly in order to make it all _real,_ penetrate the 
silicon valleyed hardness of indolent transparency. Nothing gives in cyb- 
erspace, cried Travis in return, searching for _anything_ to place his 
member in, _anything_ that called forth Cynthia's presence from vast dis- 
tances across the galaxy. The farther the distance, Cynthia mused, the 
greater the perversions committed in the scree of text wobbling down the 
screen-slopes as the two of them typed uselessly onto

one another, reaching across the desk, turning off the monitor, proceeding
further and further entanglement, pushing the boundaries of the galaxy it-
self, convulsively, out of Cynthia's throbbing womb, a few nebula hanging 
uselessly on Travis' enormous organ!
