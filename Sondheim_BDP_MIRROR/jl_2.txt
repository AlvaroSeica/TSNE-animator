First they shot some pellets into space like a big gun, that was the first
I think before much of anything else, maybe after sputnik. Scattershot,
broadcast. 

They shot a rocket at the moon which hit the moon and had video in the
nose; I saw the film. The moon gets bigger and bigger and just when you
think it's the biggest of all, video noise. 

There's a moral here: Don't get too close to the real or you'll either get
killed or overloaded.

On the other hand, you can always withdraw to motherstructures (Bourbaki),
arrows and objects (category theory), fractals everywhere. The wobbling
pivot of the world is irreducible.

I wait for the great storms to begin.

The great storms will come as information renders itself more and more
useless, as the manageriality of knowledge (which I've yelled about for
twenty years) replaces informed introspection, as the world blasts itself
through desert and ozone, contained and uncontained wars, and collapse of
nation-states coupled with post-industrial national enclaves.

But the storms, I predict, will be ontologically unexpected - great waves
of plasma sweeping the cosmos, heat before, and ice in retreat. A litany
of frozen gestures will be left behind, with no interpretant, no signi-
fied. Earth develops serrated edges out of organism; Pierre is just about
to fire a gun; Jocelyne is holding a camcorder.
