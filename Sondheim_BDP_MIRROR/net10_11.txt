SURREAL


This list is _contaminated._

"The body is but a wound. None of our wounds, in a sense, is new, re-
gardless of the economic, military, police, psychological techniques
that inflict them. But from now on, the wound is just a sign of itself,
signifying nothing other than this suffering, a forbidden body, deprived
of its body." (Jean-Luc Nancy, _Corpus,_ in The Birth to Presence.)

In my world, nothing lends itself to another. 
In my world, everything coheres, and the real makes itself anew.
I abjure the surreal slip into the domain of contiguous dreams.
The most difficult thing of all is to say something about the real.
To represent the real is to partake of the presence of gender and 
politics.
Each of my texts establishes its own realm of truth, desire, discomfort.
I write only for the existence of the reader, only for my own.
To write the existence of things is to speak at the presence of 
creation, the incantation of double or triple speech (song is excess).
In my world, unlikely combinations of objects remain unlikely
combinations.
Before the fear of death there is the fear of life; before death's
finality, the fate of life; and before the event of death, the occurence
of life.
All truths are unlikely.
