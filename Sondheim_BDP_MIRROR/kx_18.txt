Hello, this is Doctor Goodbye. You do not have cure.
There is no cure for substitution. Your X.
As in: I would have fought for X, bitterly.
There are chains of consequences. There are safe-words.
You say X. You are removed from this reality.
There are chains of consequences. There are chain-negations.
You say X. You have been Y for W. You say Y. You have been Z for V.
You perform X, as in: I perform X with gusto.
You see nothing special. You are not removed from this reality.
If you perform X and X is not in database, then You see nothing special; 
else if you perform X and X is in database, then You see Y.
If you see V, W, X, Y, Z, then You see nothing special.
You say Everything and Nothing is in database.
You do not have cure. This is Doctor Goodbye.
