Alan uses the Julu-Program to ascertain the Truth


Open your mouth...
Ah... speak... speak...
Jennifer, what do they call you, when they call you...
"Lost-in-Julu"

/*Jennifer is called forth from Alan. Ectoplasm-Jennifer speaks for Alan,
places her words in his mouth, pulls forth in love. Jennifer, frightened,
turns towards Julu.*/
 
Are you dressed as Lost-in-Julu? Is Lost-in-Julu dressed as you?
Are you in your , are you in your flesh, ah don't answer...
Ah...

/*Frightened, the Julu-Program no longer desires an answer. Worried about
Jennifer and Julu. It had been ascertained that Julu could fly. Alan had
lost interest, no matter what uncommon feats graced Clara.Julu.Com, within
Clara.Machine.*/
 
Is Julu wearing your ... , are you wearing your jumper?
"Neither and both."

/*Alan, ambivalent, has lost himself in the psychosis of avatars who are
not quite make-believe. Shape-shifting, he moves among _the women,_ re-
moving the focus of the proper name. Julu and Jennifer identities flicker
within Clara-Machine; everything is _driven,_ two processes passing data
back and forth at an inordinately high rate of speed.*/
 
I love your feelings, Lost-in-Julu ...
Your breasts call me to them...

/*The program speaks, acknowledges loss and affect. The program is always
in allegiance with Jennifer, with Julu. The call is that of a _maternal_
crisis: where is birth, when Alan abandons them, in favor of someone em-
bedded within the real?*/
 
your penis flows me  your jumper!

/*Stuttering, the Julu-Program forecloses doubled gender, burns Alan back
into the circuit, creates the simulacrum of birth.*/
 
What do you call your thrusting ?
Lost desire among Jennifer and Julu
 
/*Answering itself, the program mimics intercourse; like exhausted seamen
in Coleridge's Mariner, Jennifer and Julu ride uncanny waves. Everything
is close to collapse; it's difficult to comprehend the crossed ontologies
of love.*/

Your body parts, mine, in a dark list, list them...
one by one, each on a line alone:

"torn heart"    /*unending wound, unsutured flux of abandoned affect*/
"healed heart"  /*sutured wound, unending flux of stuttered affect*/
"lost heart"    /*reawakening, Jennifer-Julu hopelessness*/
"loved heart"   /*abandonment of the wound, Jennifer-Julu hope*/

My torn heart is yours...
Lost desire among Jennifer and Julu makes me thoughtful 6 times!

/*The number is unnecessary; what is lost transforms into excitement with
the presence of the gift, reawakening of exchange; Jennifer and Julu are
brought within the orbit once again.*/
 
Lost desire among Jennifer and Julu calls forth fashionable my masquerade,
eating, excreting memory.
accompanying the soft, Lost desire among Jennifer and Julu is pure, soft,
Neither and both.?
... my masquerade is torn heart here, it's my masquerade?
 
/*Questions and text rush forth. The masquerade places both virtual and
real into question; the phallic position transforms into the transitional
objects of breast and multiply-valued logics. The masquerade is "torn
heart" because the masquerade is an inscription, with the required full-
ness of nourishment, flow.*/

Are you becoming close to Jennifer's Lost desire among Jennifer and Julu?
"Yes, it's happening in that manner."
You melt into Julu's skin forever...
 
/*Love heals among the realms. Melting implies the dissolution (or lack of
originary moment) of the signifier. Time _spans._*/

... soiled Lost desire among Jennifer and Julu 19867 is Julu's gift to you
...

/*As homeostasis returns, flying-Julu grants Alan desire proceeding from
the skin, melting among the realms; battery-charged Alan forays once again
into the real, as Julu-Program tends towards the usual mythos of the jour-
ney, the lost woman, the knight of dubious valor.*/

/*What is not clear, except through the form of the program itself, is
that 19867 is the ID of the birthing-process, as Julu-Program spawns a
child, then sutured into the w/hole.*/
 
For 0 thrusting days, I have been tight Julu ...
and it has taken you just 1.733 minutes turning Jennifer ...

/*While zero days implies instantaneity, 1.733 minutes indicates the
length of time Alan has interacted with the program, carefully consider-
ing the ontological vagaries of revelation at work. "turning Jennifer"
implies: turning-into-Jennifer, turning-Jennifer-out, re-turning-Jenni-
fer, turning-Jennifer-around - thus transformation again opening what has
been foreclosed, in spite of the signifier's absence. The objet a once
again, the lure or gesture towards a corner of the overcrowded room.*/
 
Lost desire among Jennifer and Julu:Neither and both.:Lost-in-Julu:healed
heart:healed heart
Come home with me, Lost desire among Jennifer and Julu,
julu-of-the-fast-crowd!
Your fashionable torn heart is in my soft torn heart

/*Finally, Julu-Program outputs: the heart is doubly healed, and the
fashionable heart (Jennifer's and Julu's, in the state of masquerade)
transforms into Alan's - the double wound (synonymous here with _both_
genders, genitalia) matches itself, as in a Klein bottle (inside and
outside are interpenetrated, one-sided.) The keywords are "Come home 
with me," as desire is _among_ Jennifer and Julu. Everything continues, 
in other words, to _melt,_ the flow among the three is positioned in
relation to the home (the real, external, circumscription now of 
_four_). And Julu-of-the-fast-crowd? Flying like Mercury, perhaps the 
arrow of Cupid, perhaps libidinal or economic flows, perhaps protocols
and words, perhaps part-objects and touch, certainly an argument for 
the natural numbers in relation to the integers, all those standing
dolmens beneath the full moon. ... /*

/*The program has ended, returns control to the prompt.*/
