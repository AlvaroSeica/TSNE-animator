Across the jeweled sandals glittered as lost rings in the sands,
She-camel raced past a woman bearing musk, you lightly on her skin,
Called towards the wadi where hidden from all view but for her,
Time traced filaments erased in sounds, you are no nomad,
But sprayed stars gather your steed like eunuch's memories of her,
Twenty formulas in Egypt, fifteen in Syria, I would add five in Rome,
Visitations of the grape, chalice of pure purple wine,
These were all the slaves beneath her, beds of perfect flesh,
Toned into oases of color and longing, gardening of musk and death,
She in Aleppo, twelve in Damascus, the love of remnants, silver cloth,
But for nights spent among eunuch and virgin, she whom love abounded,
Never abundant, veiled and cut or bladed, hungered by steed or camel,
Dark rock in black sky, among vultures, scattered birds,
Would have been to sing in Jar al-Buwaira, valley of tamarisks,*
Fourteen, and then twelve, and then twelve, she erased,
Abounded, there were gazelles, Turban, wild olives and always more,
Grain among grain, sand among sand, rock among rock, stream in stream,
Wind in wind, sky in sky, earth in earth, wind in earth and sky,

*Some would say beyond, or farther, some would say anywhere at all,
 would say to hear pure sound, would say for perfect presence.
