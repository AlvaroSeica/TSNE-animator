"See, I don't look at things that go on around me and comment on them
because that's just not the way I am. I only comment about what is closest
to me, which is myself and the way I feel. Also with what goers on, you
have a matter of opinion - yes or no, good or bad, happy or sad.  But _how
I am_ is not a matter of opinion, but it is a fact. [...] See, it's not
that I find myself so interesting. What I express best is myself. I mean,
I'm not like a storyteller; Exene is more of a storyteller. I'm more ... I
just express how I am and that's the only story I really know or can com-
ment on or have any desire to comment on, because I know it best. I only
know how _I_ feel." Lydia Lunch in Judith Ammann, Who's been Sleeping in
my brain? 

Can any of us express otherwise?*
