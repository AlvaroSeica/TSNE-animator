First and Last Writing


First and last _writings_ ordains Being with matrix,
Beings with the task of everyday duration. To endure.
First and last _writing_ recuperates the scribbled maternal
In order that a furrow is produced without a hole
Through which writing falls. Last is that _wryting_
In which the hole is in a body, Being sloughs from language,
Beings are forms of invitation.*

Someone would invite Beings to a party, and they have holes.
They wryte and rub themselves raw through pants and dresses
And even coats. There is something funny about noises while
Organs secrete. But that an explanation, in Uruk they'd get
Down dirty drunk too, impress night truths into day lies
Into clay. Well, that's my take on it. But I think of that
Everyday duration and how we're at the end of writing "now."
