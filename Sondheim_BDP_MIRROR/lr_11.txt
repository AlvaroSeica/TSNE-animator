"I pretend the screen is not there. "The screen is my failure. "I'm afraid
of moving around. "I can't look straight at someone else. "The screen is
my life. "I have to forget the screen is there. "I have to pretend I'm in
the room. "The screen is safe but the surface is flat, deadly. "I think of
the mysteries of radio. "Where do the sounds come from. "No one sees me
while I listen. "I love to listen.:"I have to forget the screen is there.
"The screen bothers me, a sign of my failure to get along. "When I listen
I know the very air is singing around me. "The screen drops away to noth-
ing. "If the screen is dead, the air is alive. "I'm afraid of the screen.
"I pretend it's not there. "I pretend everything is open and everything is
on the radio.:"In the world I'm awkward; I'm afraid everyone will see the
real me. "I can't look another in the eyes. "I can't live without the
screen. "I'm afraid of looking at myself in a mirror, afraid of glass
surfaces, windows, of any sort. 

"Into and out of the soul.:: Your yours
"screen is across my "screen
