One and Many


Let me try putting it this way - there are two socio-cultural movements
underway simultaneously - a movement towards unity, and one towards ir-
reducible multiplicity. The former is found in the impulse towards Grand
Unified Theories, the Gates-Internet and TCP/IP protocols, the conser-
vative swing away from postmodernity, and current American imperialist
ideology. The latter is found in emergence towards autonomy through para-
llel processing, the Internet as communities and coagulations, some cur-
rent thinking about the 'society of mind,' and post-structuralist thought. 
The latter emphasizes local territorializations, micro-politics, and 
grass-roots; the former is top-down.

Bottom-up and top-down have _always_ been considered in this relation - 
look at the medieval debates on nominalism/universals. The current situa- 
tion, however, is exacerbated by an inordinately complicated global or- 
dering and fragmentation, as well as a realization, that even within 
formal logic and mathematics, there may be no overriding steering-mechan- 
isms (i.e. the way axiomatics were problematized by Godel, Tarski, etc.). 
Now this thinking is carried through into both the physical and psycho- 
analytical domains as well; whatever law there is, holds locally (i.e. 
among cells in artificial life), and it is the confluence of local con- 
ditions that produces emergence. Further, emergence may be too complex to 
be formally described globally - and the local description may carry no 
hint of the emergent phenomena.

I still don't know what I'm talking about. It's later in the afternoon, 
and I'm closer.
