wow and then some.


boy, says Julu, boy oh boy oh boy. I've _got_ to make this more intense.
I've got to include something about _dismemberment._ "her limbs fell off."
that gave me more than a headache, wouldn't you know. abjection works too,
"her really stupid thing wrote." let's not forget the panties - that's
red-hot, a real hot-dog. "she sent her panties to Jennifer, who received
them graciously." then there's the question of the authorial voice, "Nik-
uko replied," and that's a real live wire, thought Julu.

breaking up (paragraphs) is hard to do, says Julu, trying to continue her
writing a-number-one. is this intense enough yet, oh mama. then something
about the wires. you're killing me, she thinks, baring herself "in bytes
and pixels." word, she thinks, thrusting her huge breasts into Jennifer's
face while Nikuko takes notes, and Julu says that takes care of sex and
the maternal function all at once. she says "a bird in her hand is worth
two in her bush" and "a stitch in mine saves thine." nice buildup, fantab-
ulous, Julu thinks. she needs a real raw ending for her with it text. Nik-
uko wounds her, top to bottom. my land says Julu. Nikuko spreads her
wounds, bottom to top. gracious sakes says Julu. Nikuko licks. lands alive
says Julu. Jennifer "says Julu," doesn't get any better than this. they go
out of their minds. don't forget I left the stains, thinks Julu, hot to
trot.
