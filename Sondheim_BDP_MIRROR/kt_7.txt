Happiness

When I know I can't possibly do better than I'm doing, that this is _it_ -
then I can relax and keep on doing it. If I'm ill or in pain, then I know
that just about anything is the best I can do, just with the doing of any-
thing. I have a friend who lived with my second wife and said to me, well,
Alan, I said to her, I'm always doing the very best I can, and if it's not
good enough for you, then you should leave, because there's nothing else I
can do. In one of my texts, upon leaving Los Angeles for Tasmania, I wrote
that I was pushed to the limit and so I was not responsible for anything
beyond that because there was nothing else I could do. Not often, but on
occasion, I will be somewhere, when for a time I will have felt that I did
"good," and that fills me with satisfaction. Very rarely will I feel that
I have achieved a perfect moment, and at that point, I'm likely to cry, in
a manner similar to the Heian nobility, being overcome by emotion. Usually
these moments are when I feel that this is in fact the best of all possi-
ble worlds, in which I am doing my very best. I will watch myself trying
to do my very best, and so much of the time I will fail, but even then, in
the very small, I am sure I am doing my very best.
