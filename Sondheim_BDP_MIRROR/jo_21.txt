The Gap, a Useless Error (of Western Philosophy)


Jennifer is thinking about her philosophy of immensity, the stain or resi-
due, the lack of the thing at the end of the road, the Ground, the use-
lessness of philosophy, her special Heidegger. She reads about the _gap_
that swallows Jupiter's asteroid, black hole central galactic matrix; it's
in Dr. Alfred Guzzoni's Summary of a Seminar based on Heidegger's On Time
and Being:

"Then we asked whether the expression 'the Being of what _is_ today all
over the _earth_' does not signify a narrowing down of the universal prob-
lem of Being to the small planet, the tiny grain of sand which is called
earth, whether this narrowing down does not stem from an anthropological
interest. This questioning was not pursued further. We did not explain how
Framing, which constitutes the essence of modern technology, hence of
something that, as we know, only occurs on earth, can be a name for uni-
versal Being."

_Was not pursued further,_ not on a path (then) or matrix (now) leading
from the absolute of the universal towards offhandedness, a matter of the
_gossip of theory._ Or towards for that matter, a way out of the Black
Forest, admittedly one among many, wolves and bears notwithstanding. Or
again towards the other engaged with open mouths and fluids; whatever re-
mains on earth liquifies.

It's different on those other planets, oceans boiled away, skies on fire.
