he's turning in the room but the room turns |
nothing keeps up with either of them |
the rotation moves quickly at twice the human speed |
the rotation moves at room speed |
the windows have moving stars and furious dark objects |
he's turned towards the windows and turned away |
his face falls away |
his bones fall away |
furious he moves as the walls disappear in the moaning of the room |
the moaning of the room |
the dark blue background the light green of the room |
infrared and the ultra-violet of the moving dark dusk sky |
he's shuddering as he generates the furious dark objects |
the furious dark objects move everywhere each is different and unique |
the furious movement of the dark objects generate his movement |
they generate the turning of the room |
they generate his turning at twice the normal speed |
creation of worlds and neuroses |
creation of lesions in the propriety of culture |
rushing towards him rushing away |
he can't think when he's moving that furious and fast |
