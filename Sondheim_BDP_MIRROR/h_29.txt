Beautiful Words.





The days are always beautiful this time of year. Without exception. There

are stars in the sky as clear and cool as you could ever want. There is 

always the honeysuckle smell and it fills you with blossom and delight. I

cannot tell you more about the honeysuckle smell. The sky is a bloom of 

deep blue circulating a long arch across realms one can never reach. Below

I see the phantasmagora of the sun, double sun spurned and spurting its way

across stuttered dark waters crossed by rivers meandering on their own.



O you will come to me singing of beauty beauty. I will hear you a long 

breath moment before your lovely presence. There are speckles through the

long day of the summer, dark swirling sperm in the midst of the whiteness

of satin in hard and heavy now. It is a desire to be heard, always. It is

a desire. Ah thus the love of this.
