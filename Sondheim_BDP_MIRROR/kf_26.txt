What the Buffer Keeps


"To whom does the schizophrenic write?
To whom the psychotic?
Would you be that person?"
To whom does the schizophrenic speak?
To whom the psychotic?
Would that you would be, that person?
Would that you would be, that person spoken to?
From whom is the speaking?
For whom is the speaking?
For your desire, for the desire of the psychotic or schizophrenic.
For the purpose of circumscriptions of everywhere the unknown world.
For the caress of the analyst through the therapeutic transference.
For the career of the patient.
Now you are far afield!
Now you do not recognize that your parents want to murder you!
Now you do not feel the trembling hands holding the tiny infant!
Now you do not feel the pain squeezed out through the keyboard!
Now you do not understand what _the buffer keeps._
