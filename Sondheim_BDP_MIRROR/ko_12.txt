Handshaking (for the ZKP5 Glossary)


Handshaking, mutual orientations, onsets, denouements, protocols, is
critical when anything communicates with anything else - when anything
has a _relation_ to anything - including one of defining, constraining,
or foreclosing the notion of anything (or entity) itself. It's handshak-
ing that allows Nikuko to ride my bones in cyberspace, allows me to 
reveal Jennifer and myself to all and everyone.

Handshaking is the heart of communality - identity, equivalence, and tran-
sitive relationships among cyberspatialities. It is the forgotten struc-
ture, the governance in the ground of the world.

The _meat_ of communication, meat to meat, is the handshake; the talk
and gesture reside on the rim of the hole. After the handshake between
modem and modem, I am permitted to write this, send it to you. But
always after, after the _thing_ itself.
