For Ah... Prophecy of Cybermind, Disorders of the Real, 1988







Alan Sondheim





Alan Sondheim lives in another world, just like our own.

He could not tell one from the other.

He was sure they were joined at the horizon.

Alan Sondheim saw the world was his.

He'd say, "Hi, world!"

He saw the world in a mirror, except for a corner,

a hinge. He couldn't move in that close.

There was always the mirror to contend with.

Alan Sondheim would listen to you speaking and would

listen to Alan Sondheim listening to you speaking.

Sometimes he would miss a sentence or two.

He would catchup when he stopped listening.

Alan Sondheim knew that the world was doubled.

He saw that it was halved. He had half of

everything but he could always skip a line.

He had half of everything but nothing puckered.

It puckered where everything was.

Alan Sondheim would watch it burst, but it would burst

in one world and not the other, not even fragments

would burst from one world to the other.

Alan Sondheim was not joined at the horizon.

He did not hear or see so well. He heard his own

heartbeat when he could make everything quiet. He

could make everything quiet and even his own death

quiet. He would see the stuffing of the world first 

and then the world. Alan Sondheim would hardly hear

because of the stuffing of the world. He could hardly 

see, either.
