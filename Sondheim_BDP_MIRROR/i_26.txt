Ground Control





Shuttled information travels during electron orbits stuttering themselves

around broken space, smeared in orbital clouds; running with a fury, 

they're too simple to concern themselves with the wolves of winter. Down

elsewhere, ground control parcels the space of the body near the machinery

which connects, throughputs, to Japan, Australia, stains thrown across the

civilized world. The civilized world:



/defined by protocols, etiquette, organized in steps paced with the clock

breath, thresholds gathering information as clocks underpace/outpace the

_other._

/intensifications of lines, traces, ashes, inscriptions, speech acts, 

procurements, endocolonizations, simulacra, labia, phalli, packets, data- 

grams, petit a's, habiti, emissions: electron pipelining dividing the

natural as a point in two-dimensional space, not even an obstacle.



Ground control loses force as graphemes and analytical divisions, survey-

ings, gather across the landscape dominated by the gnomon. What measures,

measures itself, expends itself; what travels, speaks, dissembles. What

means this spending of an _alterior economy,_ that of the other? Ground

control speaks, loses control, divides the boundaries, folds inward, in

the matter of the _curl._



The Shuttle will land in the curl. The Shuttle will be comforted.
