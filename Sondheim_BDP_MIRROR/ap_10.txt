Lies and Deceit


At the end of a Pete Townsend piece the character asks whatever happened
to "all that beautiful hippy shit"? During the 60s and 70s humanity wit-
nessed the last evil, last terror, last goodness, last era of redemption. 
Since then language has foreclosed upon itself, truth has problematized,
and the resulting cynicism is nothing more than the self-guarding of a
civilization under siege. The difference between Janis Joplin and Lydia
Lunch is one between the sung body and the body of song, between inhabi-
tation and construction. In the digital era, construct replaces essence,
and without essence there is no truth in the midst of well-defined form-
ulas - only what works and what doesn't work, presaged decades ago by
situational ethics. This is the pivot of the world against which lies and
deceit become part of the order of the day, not in difference from truth,
but in truth's deference. Hippy shit was based on possibility; when pos-
sibility becomes (software) upgrade, the loss is too subtle to register,
lost itself in quantification. This is not the classical _reign of num-
ber,_ but the _rain of number,_ statistics for its own sake, flooding and
constructing what passes for and thereby becomes the real. _Nothing_ is
left out, and that is the extent of the loss, to the fullest extent of the
law, justice notwithstanding.
