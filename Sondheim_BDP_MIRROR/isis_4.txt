After a while negation buzzes. Automata make negation machines. 
Negation machines buzz for me. They make things faster. a number 
of deaths, always to a news station helps. The bed's to my rear; 
angering buzzing aroused. you can fawn them. you can come. I'm 
your buzz - and then you'd have your dead zone, but no dead. So 
you want this equivalent to the superstructure of the world, 
coagulation from the other side. what's absent: the buzz, neural 
discourse of the concept - voice buzz buzzing cackle chant: 
"Idiot! I'm still talking. The phone's buzzing, the sky's just 
there, in flight." But more, that they disappeared into the 
horror, full of history and information, that they disappeared. 
sludge-world, bodies. it's the head in them that names.

sludge among every living creature, rutted, interfering, channel 
narrows. it's the head in them that's named.

then nothing.



death of representation

i'm sick of pictures.
i can't make more pictures. 
everything i touch dies. i touch myself.
i can't make more pictures of myself.
i was embedded in machinery and i'm not embedded in machinery.
i look in the machinery of a mirror and my bones fall off.
my bones fall off before i'm robbed of them. 
before i'm robbed of neoliberalism.
before late capitalism's stolen from me.
before i plead guilty for being alive.
i plead guilty! i am still alive!
