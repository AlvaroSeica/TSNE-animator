Seduction


You can cycle video through html pretty easily with high-bandwidth; you
can also create frames that with http-equiv="Refresh" content="x; <>" re-
fresh their partitions at varying rates and contents.* You could do a re-
cursion on that, increasing frames beyond reason, finally clogging Net-
scape and holy Moses! bringing the whole thing down!

You can do blink-text with Netscape on refreshing frames and get away
without animated gifs but with complex textual realignments; if you've got
internal or relative links, you can keep the contents moving as surgical
emplacements/replacements, the laminar screen moving rapturously into you.
(It's the surgery; try a phenomenology of coagulation, cauterization, sut-
ure, and incision.)

You can conjure the periphery from the center, shivering center framed by
melded framings. You can stepdance indefinitely one against the other,
listen to Jennifer try to speak her body, inscribe against the crackled
frames. You can make stutter-jump up and down the page, open and close,
bind the variables, hold them hostage. 

I'd speak her frame-name, I'd say, hold still. I'd watch for a while, jump
into memoranda, glimpse of panties against the raised-skirt frame. What
text is simply staggering, play Phaedra against Medea, play Antigone. 

You can do this with illusory laminate, turn flesh against part-and-parcel
text, mesmeric wryting making true-Jennifer-laminate-inner-speech, her
pleasure-cancellation, blank-wall three-dimension, permanent emergence.
Oh, you wait and wait for her, oh, the waiting.
