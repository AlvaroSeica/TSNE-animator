      	
     1	switzerland and sweden curling on 
     2	television, i'm thinking about video, 
     3	whether context is everything, and / 
     4	or whether there's anything at all, 
     5	other than context, after all one can 
     6	like anything, set up like a curling 
     7	shot, i went out yesterday, down the 
     8	street, perhaps the day before, i'm 
     9	not sure, past willie sutton's house, 
    10	made a short video, actually into the 
    11	memory stick at not so good 
    12	resolution, with 'this PAL' camera 
    13	i'm testing, he was the most wanted 
    14	by the fbi at one point, bank robber, 
    15	famous for something he didn't say, 
    16	the house is a wreck what with all 
    17	the development and gentrification 
    18	going on, the owner wants 1.2 million 
    19	for the property and the adjacent 
    20	one, the house will have to be torn 
      	
    21	down, that's certain, it's been 
    22	it's already falling, you can see 
    23	through the walls, looks like sweden 
    24	is ahead, rooting for switzerland, so 
    25	it's the decay of a bank robber's 
    26	home, he'll never get the money, i 
    27	mean for the property, it's about one 
    28	and a half times the footage everyone 
    29	else is asking, still unbelievably 
    30	expensive, there were toughs living 
    31	there a while ago, they wrecked the 
    32	place, i think the owner was waiting 
    33	for that, now it's boarded up, 
    34	falling apart, dangerous to the new 
    35	neighborhood, the contiguous houses 
    36	are in fine fettle, excellent shape, 
    37	you might be able to tell with the 
    38	video, i'm not sure, they're coded 
    39	for better times, it's a shaky place, 
    40	the neighborhood, going up at the 
    41	moment in terms of property values, 
    42	wait until the next terror and 
    43	everyone leaves new york, we'd go, we 
    44	we'd go too, you can reach us at
    45	http://www.asondheim.org/sutton.mpg 
    46	but we won't guarantee we'll answer, 
    47	we've got no electric, toilet, 
    48	nothing but the walls and the place
    49	of the man who robbed banks, did he 
    50	have children, was he married

Four Dances: Screen, Bait, Abu Gharayb, Electric


1. Screen

Projected video with dancers before the image - as if it's a multi-media 
performance, dancers 'inserted' into on-screen narrative - but they're out 
of sync, they don't match up - the narrative falls apart, it's a mess - 
they stumble on-screen as well - it's amateurish, a poor attempt - it's 
trying to compete with the big multi-media companies - reaching beyond 
what the company can do - the dancers are angry - they're really angry - 
they're in front of an audience in a production which is falling apart - 
they didn't sign contracts for this - one of them walks off - there's a 
gap in what's left of the narrative - this continues until the projection 
comes to an end -

The video is poor, hand-held, amateurish, shaky - with some of the same 
dancers - they speak a bad pointless dialog - along the lines of

"Where's Dmitri?"
"I don't know. The Revolution is about to begin."
"I love you, Martya." "I love you too Johannes."
"But we can't wait forever." 
"No, we can't wait forever. They're looking for us all over the city."
"Are you sure they're looking?"
"No, I'm not sure. But then... I'm not sure of anything anymore..."
"That is why I love you, Martya." [...]

There is some action - anxious walking about the city - nervous, they look 
behind them, they're watching - they think they're being watched. And yes, 
they dance all of this, on-screen, off-screen. The live dancers may speak, 
try to make sense of the dialog; they can't. The live dancers may be the 
same as the on-screen characters; it would be best, however, to split the 
company - half on, half off, as if they're trying to come together across 
an impossible ontology.

Bad film music from the screen, 'programmatic.' The live dancers simply 
don't understand.


2. Bait

Either projected video or live - a nude man and woman masturbate stage 
left; they are nude, exposed; the dance ends when they cum. They observe 
two dancers -

Either dressed or nude - ballet positions, lifts, contacts, splits (facing 
audience and masturbating couple) - the dancers sexually aroused - if nude
(preferable)

Masturbating constantly during their movements (the man clearly erect, the 
woman with her hand increasingly wet, the audience close enough to smell 
the scent of sex) - if at all possible they cum simultaneously with the 
masturbating couple.

Swan Lake or some such music.


3. Abu Gharayb

Dancers act out positions of prisoners in Abu Gharayb photographs. Lyndie 
England is played by a prima ballerina, her fiancee by the lead male. The 
dance should move from position to position. At first it appears opportun- 
istic; it becomes increasingly uncomfortable to watch, as if England and 
her fiancee were becoming too involved in the violence. Faked blood, 
bruising, should be used, as well as leather masks, ropes, etc. .

In other words, a series of iconographic figures. The lead dancers try 
their best to behave as beginners - in dance, in torture. The rest of the 
company is appears reactive; they're uncomfortable in their roles (often 
nude) - broken, scraped. The audience wants more; the audience wants none 
of it.

The prisoners are arranged by the lead dancers. They resist weakly at 
best. The lead dancers appear simultaneously American and Imperial (i.e. 
of any emblematic power). The prisoners appear as Other, signed as Other; 
nude, they are the same. The prisoners have nothing. (Perhaps, but only 
perhaps, the lead dancers carry Bibles. Or there are Bibles at hand. Or 
there is a cross at hand. Or a crown of thorns.)


4. Electric

The dance-floor is covered with wire - grids, meshes, barriers. This acts 
as an antenna for VLF (very low frequency) radio. The antenna is fed 
through heavy notch filters cutting back on the local (60hz, 50hz) power 
grid; it leads to a NASA VLF-3 radio whose output is fed back into the 
space vis-a-vis loudspeakers. For one to five dancers. Dancers should be 
nude or with little clothing; they interact with each other, with the 
wires. Actions include sliding fingers and palms along the wires, wrapping 
the body (limbs, neck, penis and breasts if nude, fingers, waist), moving 
in and out of contact with other dancers. Performers should try to 
maximize sound production as inductance, etc. change. Stage lighting is 
sinusoidal, i.e. lights slowly increasing to maximum, then decreasing to 
darkness, and back again. At first this appears as 'effect,' but it soon 
establishes the rhythm of the dance.

The dancers 'worry about' the wires, about dancing among the wires, 
between the wires, on them. This may not have been in the contract. (The 
contract might have specified, however, 'any and all.')

The dancers behave as ionizations, lightnings, atmospherics, insects, dead 
and live wires, environments. Tech runs a sound-board with effects, 
including the possibility of sending the sound through AudioMulch or other 
similar programs. The dancers establish and contradict their own rhythms. 
The sounds screech and roar.

==

The dances reference projections, introjections - screens, bodies, poli- 
tics, physical fields. Elements from one - for example Bait - may be mixed 
with others - for example Electric. Screen and Abu Gharayb are resonant; 
Abu Gharayb and Bait are resonant.

The dancers are reeling, on edge, nervous, difficult, a problem, their 
desires constrained by spectacle. The dancers are on exhibit, behavioral 
codes thwarted or broken. If a dancer feels comfortable, he or she should 
push the dance further.

There are many kinds of ecstasy, violence. Ecstasy and violence, beauty, 
sexuality, and horror, interpenetrate. For the dancers, everything is at 
risk.

After the dances, the dancers should be hurried off the stage.

==

Back-stage, a room of rest, meditation, place of transformation from 
politics 'and all the rest' to everyday life. This space is inviolate. 
Dancers (perhaps) may use the room during a performance for recuperation. 
Perhaps the stage is emptied.

Video is always an emergency. The dancers emerge into (their) (other) 
skins.

Every piece may end early. A program may consist of one to four pieces. 
The specific choreography, if there is such, is created by the head of the 
company, in line with the intentions of the dance.

For Abu Gharayb, the lead dancers should be dressed in uniforms identified 
with empire and dictatorial power. For Electric, nude dancers may have 
lightning bolts drawn on their skin - drawn as children would draw; the 
bolts would blur with sweat. For Screen, the dancers (perhaps) should have 
specific character costumes; they are 'in character' - their character is 
taken away from them (by mismatched blocking, pacing, clumsiness). The 
dancers in Bait, if nude and masturbating, should dance perfectly, 
(perhaps) facing the audience as much as possible, as if - Look, this is 
what I can do in this doubling of art and arousal (as if there is a 
difference). As if - I am aroused by the audience (by you) (in the line of 
sight). For Abu Gharayb, the dancers form a closed circuit; for Electric, 
an open one. For Bait, a circuit in the form of a lasso; for Screen, a 
demonstration to the audience, acting-out for the audience.

Finally the length of the performance(s) should be predetermined only as a 
maximum, the rest decided by the exigencies of the choreography and the 
ability of the dancers to continue performing in these abject or particu- 
lated circumstances.

What is Dance?


Dance is many things to many people. Tom Zummer analyzes, with uncanny 
astuteness, its very nature. Dance is play, death, play-death, an 
eroticism essential to our nature. It is a litany of poses and sequences,
a depth of being not otherwise available. The dance presented, that 
presents itself, in the second sequence, pulses with the mystery of life.
Tom Zummer has unraveled dance, only Woman dances.

Geneva Crossing


Had special permission to ride with the driver on the tram 12 line. So 8 
gigabytes across town with PAL smooth. Snowy as usual. Then reduced to 300 
megs just for an HLA compression to MP4. Tried for standard .mov and it 
hit 1.7 gigabytes, not very clear. Sorensen compression set at 70% 640 x 
512 or some such. Tried for .avi at Cinepak 80% but rendering would take a 
full day. The length of the thing is 36 minutes. Don't have a full day and 
.avi usually looks bad anyway. Tried for a 20x15 pixel for the Net. That 
blurred out, uninteresting. Went up to 80x60, increased contrast, close to 
zero Sorensen. That was intersted. Saved in QT and doubled looped the 
size. 13+ megabytes. The image is pointillist to say the least. But 
beautiful running on the desk, why not? You might even save it, run it 
full-screen. The original is still on the tape. The movement is perfect, 
smooth. Had to remove the sound, that added 35 megabytes at mono 8-bit 8k. 
At least you see grey and some colors. The colors are more than I saw. The 
increased contrast brought them out. It brought out Geneva for me. Thanks 
to the bus company. http://www.asondheim.org/tram12.mov .

The Hurtling Towards Death


O Dance apostrophic, embrace death, the body fails and falters, expends 
what remains of its energetic treasure. Forestalled by documentation's 
impoverishment, your slightest gesture remains unfulfilled, latent, lax, 
amidst the machinery of calculation, rigid ordination of numbers. 

Translation of Dance, the capturing of death, its swallowing by ordinal- 
ordination, the descent to the floor or basement of the binary, what is 
analogic reproduced by raster tending towards the infinitely fine. What
is missing -

What is missing are two wildly disparate orders of calculation, of 
mobility itself, orders which only approximate one another through techne 
and speech, code and partition. One order, that of the calculated, the 
production of parallel numerical streams representing movement and the 
muscle-mind of the Dancer (who is technically _the Danced,_ the one who 
_is Danced_ by the Dance), and the other, the frequency-laden irreducible 
neural spill of mental activity, electrical, emission and spew. 

For the mind-breath, O Dance! is reproducible only by itself, maps only 
onto itself as itself, inasmuch as the ordinal-ordination-ordinateur of 
the Dance reads and writes you as input/output, perhaps infinitely 
parallel streams, nonetheless perhaps not even clocked, nonetheless, 
across that gulf of into- or onto- mappings, or rather mappings with 
continuously-modifying metrics, nano-second by nano-second, there's no end 
to it, no beginning.

O Dance! you're nothing more than the ordinary-ordination body moving 
through space, the body of itself, at rest in and of itself, the blessing 
of the incontrovertible complexity of the world, its inhering. Any 
reduction quietly speaks and conjures the factory, automaton, robotics of 
precision and repetition. O Dance! We're not speaking of life-force, we're 
murmuring the litany of the infinitely-small, surrounded by shells and 
carapaces of computers-ordinators, maternal-paternal projection against 
the pulled muscle, the sprain, the torn ligament, the bruise. And O Dance! 
We would make of you an entire world, cosmos-Dance, ocean-Dance, particle- 
Dance, what would we do with that?

Impossible of representation, humans never give up trying, violating voice 
and mind, ordinal representation (and who said nothing about the nuggets 
of the cardinal?), the numerical cut, the definition. Jump to edit-points, 
application of points, applique. An imposing edifice! Numerical-numb, the 
prisoner of flesh, the Dancer-manque-Danseuese -

Technology of stage and lights, phenomenologies of distribution - O Dance, 
dream aloud! Dream quietly!

apologies because this doesn't happen in the real world. there are two 
united states airplanes pronouncements, but on what? imperfectly, we are

can listen without or outside the power grid the world manifesting itself

through manifest electromagnetic waves surrounding us. through eventhis
