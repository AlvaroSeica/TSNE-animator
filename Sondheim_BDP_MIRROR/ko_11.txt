Look what I found (dated 1974!) - Jennifer :-)


Who am I? I wish I knew! I know my name and I can tell you what clothese I
ware if I look down but I have to take som of them off to see what other
close I ware. Then I wil know and I could tel you. But you wuld want to
know only if you knew who I was and you culd tel me. You culd tel that but
culd you tel me much more? Becaus I want to kno, becaus it is good to kno
who you ar. But then I wil tel you mor.

Anyway, I am a girl with wondrus gifts of al sorts wich have been given to
me. What wuld you say that I smel the sky and hear the mone of the moon, I
mean moonlite. So what I did was went sking on my sumr vacatshun but it
was in the mountins so it was ok that ther was sno. Ther was wondrus sno
and no rane wich is soft sno that God has meltd.

nice to me. Sumtimes I am hapy Jenifer.

This is wat I lerned on my sumr vacatshun, Jenifer
