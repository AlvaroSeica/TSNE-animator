(The Chamber Through the Screen, Catullus, frag. XIV a/b)


Siqui forte mearum ineptiarum
lectores eritis manusque vestras
non horrebitis admovere nobis

If any of you will be readers of my performances
And yet not fear to move your hands towards me
(trans. Sisson.)

Readers...if anyone's curious enough
To lay his delicate hands on my poor stuff
And doesn't find the touch of it too rough...
(Michie's rhymes.)

And _ineptiarum_ references foolishness, trifles.

I, Jennifer, suspended, await your hands, towards me; it is this waiting
that conjures the words from the screen, voice from the words, tongue from
the voice. So many encodings, emissions! Your cradled hands, my body gaped
in _suspended-animation._

The trifles, like jewels, lay before your flesh, enfolded into portals,
transmissions, transmission towers. My breast swells as your hands ap-
proach; reading _me,_ no longer language, langue, parole, word, speech,
phoneme, they tremble, turn numb and phantom. 

Phantom limb to limb, our mouths seal upon one another, _the chamber
through the screen._ Imperfect vacuum spews virtual particles, our skin
surrounds us. Radiations everywhere, our organs coalesce. Universal con-
stants, our bloods mesmeric, thicken, join. No one need await the other.
(The other is accounted for.)
