(Alan) Oh wail! For I do try
Alan falls swiftly down, so sadly as he stumbles, gains his speech -
(Alan) to be conveyance of desperate misery
(Alan) so much so to give credence, as I do breathe
(Alan) or lay a wreath upon this darkened earth!
Alan weeps!
Alan wails!
Alan whimpers, as in a wake for dearest friends, in this deep and mournful
 world
(Alan) or in this swollen hollow, as grief sustains itself with public
 declamation
(Alan) Think *sob*, think *whimper*, *wail* and *sniff*
(Alan) Enough to make your tears flow full; I would be sore in selfish
 adulation, were I ignorant of your presence, and *gasp* and *wow* and
 *hold-the-breath* and *laugh* and *giggle* and all the *tattered day*
(Alan) against the Shouts and Tells, against the Message, appearing without
 source or destination: I beg you, Read me!
Alan cries!
Alan sobs to the very fullest!
(Alan) This is the strife that makes me die content,
(Alan) Since you shall never know my full intent.
Rains fall, storms gather around stark and broken trees!
(Alan) Consider the earth, the swarm, this doomed and shattered wreath!
(Alan) Content, again, and one last *sob* and *wail*
(Alan) Or *whimper" lost, oh *sniff* and I set sail!
ALL SHIPS CRASH
