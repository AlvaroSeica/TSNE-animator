recent work, experimental television center.


alan and azure bat balloons and you know your arm tires, why, jennifer?

because i do think that you must stop your arm all by itself because the 
balloon offers no resistance but the air itself.

and the air, jennifer, how does that work?

it works all the time and just see how the balloon slows.
