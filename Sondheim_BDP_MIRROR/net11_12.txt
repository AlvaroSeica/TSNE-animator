the cliff

[1].Ejaculations of sound. Vortices, edges turbulent, roll against the

presence of obdurate material. Sub-vortices, borne upon the shear,

resonate in shrill wavering tones. Nothing is sine. Broken and polished

in ellipsoidal shapes or fractured. Most of the same.

[2].Oxygenated, singed or burned dust. Leverage towards the ground. 

Laminar erasures of firestorms. Scuttling.

[3].Wave-organelles, floatations. Compressive immobilities, tailored 

above and below. Stars not on your life. 

[4].Enfolding resonance. And what would be the intensity of all reason?

Splayed upon the interior of the recursive tangent, everything. So that

a fast-forward or backward feed. What would be the presence of space and

time? _Not on your life._

[5].Occasionally a serrated shaft or wheel. Now that reason is a black

hole, the thing threads a knot, knot threads a thing. The memory of 

material might have been.

[6].From weight. Tangential imaginary. Burned through pharoah catalyst,

tethered wave. If a whisper: _everything is a natural kind._ The ending:

_everything is a natural kind._ Tangential imaginary recursion.

[7].Noise. Supra-vortices across stream and front alike. Here would be

every syllable. Foam-flecked scudding sloped debris gathering. Memory

of the pebble. Memory of the indentation of the pebble. Grain.

[8].Scuttling of identity, insect transgression. Sexual unraveling in

the surplus niche. For the most part carriers of molecules, exploding

atoms, tethered waves.

[8].From the far corners they come, names beyond them, finding the 

desolate continents of shattered planets, moons' eerie face-offs with

solar heats, scraggled metamorphoses. Infestations, tailed. Stars? Not

on your life, folded against matter. 

[8]._gTer-ston_ "dByings-phyug Ye-s'es-mtsho-rgyal, the mistress of all

mysteries, had been gathering the Pronouncements (_bka'-ma_) by seizing

them through the ability of not forgetting anything."

[9].Grinds to a halt. Huddled air, the enormous entity. Disappearance of

_the._ _Dissappearance of_ the: _everything is a natural kind._ The 

ending: disapperance of _the._ Slips, shudders, falls, skimmers, stops.

Doesn't know it.
