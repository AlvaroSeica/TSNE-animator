Very very last time, I say


What I mean is we're all going to die and then the planet will have a huge
death but of course we won't be around to see it, nothing like that. It
will be amazing and suddenly things like painting and music won't be that
important; they've got no intrinsic value. But maybe the machines will
continue for a while longer and things like my beautiful texts will just
revolve among some dying nodes for a bit of time and then nothing. And
there won't be anything around either to mourn the passing or to say that
after all _x_ and _y_ were said in the midst of the silence of speaking. 

So if we assess and reassess, now's the time; now is all the time there
is, which is why I also say, Jennifer has all the time there is, because I
am Jennifer and this is quite, extremely, serious. 

We must seize meaning because there is no meaning beyond seizure, no
thought beyond contusion, no language unborn in useless violence. My sex
places me in the middle of things, of me; out of hollow, nothing comes. I
sing when I cum, do you?

So you see, this teetering world, these texts, these cultures, pollutions,
nocturnal and otherwise, it's all the same, pasted against the image of
the world. And that is all I've been saying, except that my panties are
wet from the ground, or the ground is wet from me, and my frock spreads
all around.
