Train

what she wrote,
beauty loving you closed mouthing word you are for me oh this is forever
"me" Anyway, the train was coming. The tracks were by the side of a gully,
green and black with dark trees. There were beautiful sounds along the
thin sheen of the rails. Now the world was filled with losses as dusk
began to hide vegetation, cliffs on both sides, worlds and patterings. The
wings continued in my dreams, fluttering against a singular tremolo; for
the first time in days, I slept soundly. 

and how she liked it.
yes, so much in the world. the train was coming hard down the tracks, hard
I say... I loved the sounds made by the wheels against perfect welding,
300 kilometers an hour as darkness circled overhead, fast slim wings shud-
dering against the sky. I began to sink into an odd sleep on the overnight
express, moving several stops down the line... This time I was suspended
against bamboo, black-green pine thick with hillside moss, tarns and cav-
erns.
