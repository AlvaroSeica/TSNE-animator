More on the Same


Nikuko meant to say that science, being not a text, is a necessary aphor-
ism and antidote. That texts are breathing, that she breathes, @breathes,
there is always one or another way. That science moreover isn't tied to
diegesis, equations are bound only formally to time, and not always. That
diegesis is another kind of unfolding altogether. That core-theoretical
structures clearly exist, because as Daishin Nikuko wrote in 1971, clearly
the world has a certain style, and this, for any group, is hardly arbitra-
ry - without repetition, recursion, induction, resonance, there would be
no occurrences, not even unary or sporadic events (Broad's term). So that
the deep-structure articulation of this style might be a set of laws, or
rather the articulation is describable by such a set, middle Feyerabend,
say, notwithstanding. Whether or not the laws are recuperable by humans,
retrievable, _enunciated,_ is another thing altogether, and it's here that
Daishin Nikuko functions, even to the extent of her _declarations_ which
are themselves performative, for example @create or @dig. And Daishin Ni-
kuko would insist, this is true for most of us. So that science, being not
a text, this is a statement which is both simple and a remarkable aphor-
ism, and credit must be given to where credit is due, no matter what the
ideological consequences.
