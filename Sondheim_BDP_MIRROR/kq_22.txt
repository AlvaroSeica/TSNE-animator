I could write this turning alphabet around, b for a, a for b, or back-
wards, or through other local or global substitutions, perhaps there'd be
new sounds out of old, swarms of sado-masochisms governing unwieldy words.
or blanks, moments of silence to be filled in, or other conundrums. then
there might be numbers and I'd think about teaching the shape of the
world. and I'd worry into what it all means, the teaching, the shape of
the world, the substitutions, the sado-masochisms. a rift would open and
here I'd further insert myself, slowly, so as not to break or abrade the
skin. in the rift I'd begin to write, hands somewhat over my head; every-
thing has to fit. it would be a piece about the meaning, and this would be
the result. so this is a text of the would-be, and not what you are read-
ing, but what you would be reading, and this would-be relates to the mean-
ing, but not to the shape of the world, or rather, it is only of the world
and its shape.
