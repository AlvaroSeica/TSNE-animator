Subject: periodic notice





The Internet Text 


This is a somewhat periodic notice describing my Internet Text, available
on the Net. The work to date is divided into two sections: the Internet
Text proper, and the alphabetic text; together they would fill more than
2.5 megs, and constitute around 1100 pages total. The Text was started two
years ago ago, and has continued as an extended meditation on cyberspace.
It begins with a somewhat straightforward theoretical approach, and then,
calling on numerous ghosts (alive, quasi-alive, and dead), continues into
the domains of psychoanalysis, interiority, subjectivity, narrativity, and
so forth. My current writing, more distant in some aspects, nevertheless
references back into the strata of the whole/hole, a work which for me is
an entering into future issues of cyberspace and subjectivity in the next
millennium. 

The changing nature of these email lists, cybermind and fiction-of-philos-
ophy, hides the full textual body itself, since new readers will not be
aware of its presence. For them the text appears fragmentary, created 
piecemeal, splintered from a non-existent whole.

So this (periodic) notice is an attempt to recuperate the work as a whole,
retard its diaphanous existence. And below is the introduction, updated.
