Ploughed under


cause I'm not asked to any of your seminars
cause I don't participate in your mass poetry readings
cause I'm part of nothing in a nothing nothing
cause you don't publish me but hold out the stick
cause the last book was a decade ago
cause I don't do your seminars on your avant-garde
cause I'm not included in your avant-garde cyclopedias
cause I'm fucking hungry all the time
cause I wanna be an addict
cause I'm writing the future
cause I am the future
cause I see with second sight third site from the fourth site
cause there are exactly six people who understand me
cause I can number them 1 2 3 4 5 6
cause every word I write is breaking new ground
cause you can't see the ground
cause I'm not the star of your magazines
cause I'm so jealous I can't see straight
cause I wanna be established
cause I wanna eat right dress right talk right
cause I can't do any of these things
cause the darkness crashes like oxygen
cause I want you to love every thing I do
cause I wanna be in your mausoleums
cause I wanna be your mausoleums
cause you give me no reason for trust
cause you give me no reason to keep on going
cause I gotta go on what I gotta go on
cause there's nothing left but writing and the wall
cause I'm the wall and the writing
cause I wanna teach and I wanna preach
cause I wanna read in your seminars, bars, cars, Mars
cause I want you to drive me to God and back
cause I want you to understand what Jennifer is doing
cause I want you to understand what Nikuko is saying
cause I want you to understand what Julu is fucking
cause I want you to understand what Alan's doing with all those strings
cause I want you to understand the Heideggerian fourfold writing system
cause I don't get your grants
cause I don't get your residencies
cause I'm not in your anthologies
cause I wanna be in your dreams
cause I wanna be your dreams
cause you're blind to my writing
cause you don't see the philosophy but the poetry
or cause you don't see the poetry but the philosophy
cause it's dead and useless wood
cause I'm not at your panels
cause I don't speak can't speak at your friendly get-togethers
cause I don't know how to have friends
cause I fuck everything up
cause everything goes into the writing of the future of writing
cause a five-cup sake, cause Takuboku, there's this guy
