DADa

"I keep thinking about the memorial and what makes me saddest of all, is 
that it's the last time there will be a gathering of people with memories 
of dad or for that matter, mom. And with the house disappearing, he's 
already gone into the wilderness we're all heading towards; when I think 
about this, I start crying, weeping actually, even now. People said that 
everyone described him as a curmudgeon, but in fact what came out to me is 
that he was a conundrum to everyone; no one, possibly including himself, 
really understood him. He was and is a mystery; I don't know what he 
thought about, even when he was younger. I don't know why he didn't 
travel, don't know quite where the aristocratic airs came from, or his 
hatred of me which was palpable at times. He should somewhere along the 
line have tried to figure out what I was about; instead he judged a priori 
and for my entire life I was at a loss with him."

Narrative going nowhere, moments of intense dance. So maybe a conundrum
is metaphoric cyberspace._ Third, I recognized the conundrum: A dream 
loosen the con-text. They form kennings, conundrums, with no specific on-
tic connections, keeping myself alive. Each text is a conundrum.
For whom I have not written & for whom, always conundrum without gap or
conundrum of institutions. Wild theory is incomprehensible in your face.
There are conundrums here of course, rather easily solved, but nonetheless
blanks, moments of silence to be filled in, or other conundrums. Then:
"Your mouth, a conundrum:
first conundrum - identities as ontologies - the _thickness_ or idiocy of
second conundrum - presence of _infinitude_ - in terms of the Net -
third conundrum - this desperate desire to escape from death - losing
fourth conundrum - quality of written content - textual worlds and their
fifth conundrum - clean and proper body (Kristeva) of the digital domain -
conundrum among fleshed-out polyporaceae, transcendent knowledge of small
imaginary natures and techno, the conundrum a dream realm of easy electric
conundrums" - a lie or mockery, an occasion - applying the body or
write the lie or conundrum, the circuitous truth of theory:
"The election was clear from the geography."
This conundrum, this relative annihilation of language, fascinates dance, 
camerawork. affect, blankness, dismemberment, coupling, fifth conundrum
coupling, fifth conundrum car across fast country coupling,
opening skin odor musk. moments. enunciation nuance: order. for example,
the opening of skin odor musk. 
"Father was a cartographer and a curmudgeon; we both loved daumier. The
longtounge! farflung curmudgeon vms christ marlboro hosanna boobies !!!"

I have to prove to myself I can still play like this. I
have to prove to myself I'm better than ever. I have to
think I'm taking myself to new heights. I have to think
_this_ is the way to play and _this_ is the way to
imagine. And I have to prove to myself that you might
like this too. If you give it a chance. Them a chance.
If you do that.

probably no one will watch these, large files reduced from hd, final 
versions of windmills and walkthroughs. the memorial is in the placing
of them. the memorial is in the waiting and uploading and the thinking
of the past through the future already collapsed. these are the last
views. there are the final times. i could not have written without the
vestige, punctum, of a home. i needed a place to stand. i can't stand
in new york. i can't stand in atlanta, fukuoka, halifax, los angeles, 
hobart, perth and nottingham. unable to stand i write _diacritically,_
i place the vowels against the hardness of insistent letters, the 
_other._ the _other_ murmurs the value and addressing of the world. i
could not have this world, i had this world. nothing is remarked and
nothing gathers the shadow around the _back_ of the legs, comforts and
cuddles and mute or mewling sounds, but the house, it's as if the
house remembers, as if the house, grown older before our own demise,
speaks, and through the misery of the wind and electrical illumination
of the last presence, breathes ever so slowly across the rapture of
dreams, where i am, where i await death. i woke up in night's middle,
thinking, _i am the next to go,_ and the darkness swallowed me, and i
could not, and never have, breathed. and so many things, already in  
flight, seeking, 'and through their misery, the breath of the last
presence' ...


*//* what will come

will not be announced, will not be
or will be but none of it, none of space,
or will have none of time, no memory or notch,
no space of annihilation, no unsigning,
unraveling, no informing, no information,
none of emptiness, no shrug of memory,
no shrug,

we know that now, we bear that, temporal
distance to the future gone, in
retrograde like bad planets faking moving
slowly, un-thereing, inconceivable but no
languor, lassitude, no nothingness, nothing
of light, soundless, no gathering, no
repleasing, no ending, no, none of 
beginning, so we're a moment now, none,
now, so we're here, crawlings, everything's
on the way, off time, off the clock,
things dropping, what might transform 
simile into absence *//*
