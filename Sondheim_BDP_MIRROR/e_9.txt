Travis got some sheep stuck in the pen there, you should have seen them
running, down where the cave was. He got the gun and killed one of them,
it wasn't his, there was this smell of candles burning, scorching the cave
walls. I guess he did the cave that way, the walls. I guess he did the
walls, there was a couple of women with him. 

That way they were sisters, and the bark was flying off the log leaned
against the stump that was when he raised his hands over his head. You
could smell the wood burning when you could smell the candles but later,
out of the cave. You couldn't see the shadows then. 

You couldn't see the shadows but you could hear where Foster was buried
because she'd be out roaming and sometimes there was another shadow. 
You'd huddle there and smell Foster, she had that whiskey breath from
across the line where the Carters had their still, half-legal. 

She'd be one more shadow, sitting up all night, but the sheep weren't his
and Johnson came along and killed him, just like that, the gun resting
easy on the stump and the chips stopped. Kind of everything stopped, but
the shadow, there was that one that kept moving, all the others were quiet
like. 

And there was the fact that the ax stayed warm just the same from that day
on. From the chips flying, maybe from the candles. It was a dry summer
too. Then a couple of years ago. You could walk up, feel it like that, it
had heat in it. It would glow there and then we got rid of it.
