Precipice


Negation gnaws at the Real; negation is a precipice. Whether or not it is
a present condition or the condition of an absence, or potential, it
fissures and splinters our possibility of anchoring on more than language.
It darkens as an operator passing as a state, a condition passing as a 
situation. It throws the jar into the void. It violates sanctity. The 
Torah is protected: Make a hedge around the Torah.

Cyberspace is not. Nouns slip like water, fracture themselves. The cor-
ruption of nouns reveals itself here. Things are always already splintered
and invisible. One never sees the same without the Other. The Other is its
negation. The negation is psychosis.
