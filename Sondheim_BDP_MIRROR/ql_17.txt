5. irreducibility. Because of parasitism, the history of an instrument, 
the tendencies of the flesh and the real, the very moment of sonic produc- 
tion is irreducible; technique only goes so far, even on an electronic 
keyboard. To the extent that production occurs in real-time, unless one is 
using a digital recording device (and perhaps even then, outside of 
keyboard), what one is doing possesses a fundamental surplus or Benjaminic 
aura that differentiates one session from another, one musician from 
another, as if there were unique events in real-space, real-time. This is 
basic to rock-thought, punk-thought, and musical romanticism; it is also 
fundamental to music itself. Even one replay of a digital recording (cd 
for example) is different from another, as habitus and environment subtle- 
ly change. The industrial revolution resulted in equivalent instruments 
(for example the Boehm flute or saxophone), but their presence is always 
of separation and a unity that speaks of communality, as in horn sections 
of big bands or orchestras. (Or think, for example, of violins-in-unison: 
clearly differentiable!)
