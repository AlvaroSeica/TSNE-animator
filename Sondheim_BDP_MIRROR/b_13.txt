Epitaph





Someday you shall remember me by these words.

My little letters nuzzle one another like the very best of friends.

I was the first to introduce them and I was the last.

I have been removed from the wonderful sailor-cap of existence.



Or there are a thousand years descending to a vast plateau.

No records recall who has or has not observed from the edge.

The horizon stretches from horizon to horizon.

Clouds and stars and muffled group gropings of letters.



Dust clings to the solitary Y half-submerged in the burrowing earth.

I have returned in a state of absolute clarity.

What are bones but the bones of other bones.

There is nothing I have not been told.



Shortly after, you shall no longer remember me.

Shortly after that, the severance of letter upon letter.

Their introductions know no bounds, bulky horizons.

The wonderful sailor-cap of existence sits on my head.
