Working through Obsession


What more is there to say? To meditate continuously on cyberspace or any
other domain - is meditation always continuous? What is brought back
beyond the edge - or is it always a matter of recuperation, transversals,
representations (procured / _percolated_) from states of rumination? 

If I meditate three years on the _virtual,_ am I any nearer a solution,
truth - instead of continuous sputtering? I _require_ in the fashion of
preparation for a scanning electron microscope specimen, the free emission
of a shell - ikonic, just as the virtual is necessarily ikonic (the diff-
iculty is that one, from without, looks in vain for the symbol). 

(The) Meditation becomes a _practice,_ which, in order to operate, must
continually break with itself, in the manner of fissuring, or the fracture
which implies the inertness of the material in the first place. 

It must no longer be _a way of thinking,_ or _of the thought_ - I might
say that the very nature of the ikonic preserves it from the symbolic -
only fissuring accumulates. (What can one make of _piles of stuff_ in the
virtual realm?) 

Further, that the ikonic is the site of _disconnect_ or rather one element
of disconnection, to the extent that it is spoken-for.

If I meditate, I have already _lost._
