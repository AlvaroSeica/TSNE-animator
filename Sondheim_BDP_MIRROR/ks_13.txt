   Theirs When I Followed

   I caught this morn a tree shaped like a poem
   between two stone runnels rampant on the ground,
   where I fell uselessly, as the sky turned bone,
   and sea and mariners were nowhere to be found.
   This was the pink and florid rose of Jenny spinning
   through the drear night of Kubla's cataracts;
   nothing walked those frozen lanes at dawn, and sinning
   was no 1, 2, who slouched those bloody tracts.
   Chris, called "Gary" by his late-night friends,
   called 3 a.m. 4 Jenny, driven bad and mad, insane;
   while wayward Lucy screams and Jenny, nude, defends;
   they run to Balcroft Moor, leave reddened spoor of pain.
   If I could be a woman, all about her
   Would gather winds of far too wild weather.
