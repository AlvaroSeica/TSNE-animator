I saw a fox one night in Jerusalem that was silver-white cross in front
of me, there was a moon (that was how I was able to see him or her),
and I had at that point some sort of revelation. It felt _really good,_
and later the world was just as it had been before, exactly the same in
fact, which I didn't notice because it hadn't seemed that different
because I was concentrating on the fox.

Sometimes when I play the shakuhachi it seems to play itself, as if I 
were in touch with a spirit, and I think I'm playing _really good,_ at
least I can say that now, but during my playing if I could think, I'd 
think that I was enlightened because I can't really play that well (or
maybe that I was enlightened because it felt _really good_).

_Really good_ is a nice description for enlightenment in fact because 
it's more than just good, it's really good.
