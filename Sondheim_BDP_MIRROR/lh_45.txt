Parable


Izanagi and Nikuko created many worlds. They were walking near Hakata,
where the Hakozaki shrine descended to the sea; there were several torii
along the way. Together they watched the flight of a bird, circling the
shore, as if searching for land. It flew repeatedly between the pillars of
the torii, and seemed exhausted. Nikuko said, Look, it sees no land, even
though it is of the land, and a hard thing, made of the land. The bird
continued circling, growing weaker, and then headed out to sea. Izanagi
replied, It is breaking away, thinking of water, it doesn't realize that
water is nothing at all, taking the shape of the land. He added, The bird
sees its reflection in the state of the water, just as everyone does. What
is water, then, asked Nikuko. Izanagi answered, It is surely the form of
all things, before worlds, it came to be their form, following equally the
lay of mountains and valleys, and the flight of birds. No one can tell the
future, replied Nikuko. At that moment, a disturbance swept across the
face of the water, and a sound was heard, the beating of invisible wings.
