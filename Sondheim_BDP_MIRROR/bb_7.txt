Lag, Death, Mafias


I write about this from time to time, just pulling in or out of lag, when
the liminal takes over and the gap proves absolute, when nothing shows on
the screen, and the controls no longer operate. This is the edge, the lip
of the black hole within which everything is lost; this is the moment when
it's still possible to withdraw from the _position,_ pull back, recuperate
the skin itself. 

But I prefer to leap, send, transmit, communicate, and so the body teeters
and begins its journey downward. In freefall nothing is accomplished; the
fingers fly from the keyboard, no longer articulate their clean and proper
dominions. They gasp at air which has lost the site of oxygenation. So
words falter and thought, at thought's plateau, is neither responsive or
responsible. 

It's here that the nation-state begins its slow decay, picking up speed,
transforming into competing gangs, slogans stuck into the protocol-mater-
ial of the sky.
