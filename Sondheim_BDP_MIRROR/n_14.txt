To Whom it May Concern:

None of the texts I send out are about you.
These texts are about issues of cyberspace, its philosophy, psychology,
its psychoanalytics.
Please do not read me either in or out of these texts.
Please do not read my sexual preferences either in or out of these texts.
I will push my writing as far as I can and this does not mean that I will 
push you as far as I can; I do not push people.
Some of the texts I send out are about me.
These texts are about issues of subjectivity, virtual and otherwise.
Please do not read me either out of or in these texts.
Please do not read my social life, death, or depression in or out of 
these texts.
If I have something to say about you or to you or to you about you, I 
will say it to you, not to the list.
If you want to write me privately please do, and realize I will not write 
about your writing me to the list.
What is on the list is my work; what I write to you or read from you is 
my pleasure.
Don't confuse them.
