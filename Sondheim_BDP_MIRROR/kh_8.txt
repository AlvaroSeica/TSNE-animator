Parable


Lost in these dark woods, I came across a golden light. It seemed to say,
follow me, because it was a-moving. It went down trail, through vale and
darkling grove; I came across a ring of effigies, all with many arms and
vajra. There I did fall into a soundless sleep; there a prince did come,
son of Jimmu, to awaken me. He did take the blood from my finger, he did
write the Name across my white kimono, this red blood saying all. And I
did awaken and return to full forbearance. And from there I, Daishin Nik-
uko, emerged from ignorance by the draining of blood. For it was in those
last moments of consciousness after silent sleeping that I did know the
world and source of golden light. And I did know I would not live to tell
of either, but report only, in the form of parable, this depth of new-
found knowledge. (Thus I, Daishin Nikuko, escape the requirements of par-
able, that truth be hidden, that a secret reading is in the presence of
the word. Thus I, Daishin Nikuko, carry on.)
