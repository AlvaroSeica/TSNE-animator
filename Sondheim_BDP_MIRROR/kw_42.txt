tired of stuff of the world?


when i'm tired it's a great wheel plane, not an avatar which drives me
slightly nauseous at the edges, weathers, plains, mountains and wheels
the plane's wheeled out on the plain
the plane's on the ideal plane of the plain
the great wheel of the plane intersects the plain in a rumpled line
i can follow the line but i can't think about anything except "much"
every line is sentenced to be a sentence
every rumpled line is at fault
my grammar follows into the fault, my nerves are on edge
my eyes follow my eyes around the stares in the room, down them
who are they now, where are they now
i'll follow everyone in the whole wide world, i'll lose myself
i'll be your path behind you
i'll be on your path crossing the plain at the edges
sooner or later, there will be a great apology on the plane
i'm trying to think when the pilot's too tired to follow the wheel
the pilot is me and i'm crossing the plane of you
now i will climb the very great towers of fire
there are flames above and below me, there are great flames surround me
now i will survey the lands of all these letters of terror
from the towers, consumption, consumption from plains and edges
forgive me my thinking, i'm trembled from too much exhaustion
