Substantiality


Secret of Webpages - their _substantial_ appearance, blocked text, walled
construction - backgrounds appearing as pure/idealized objects. This is
accentuated by form and ruler outlines, scrollbars, etc. - as if one is
viewing a laminar architecture. The objects are gemlike, perfectly lumin-
ous. Their relative ontological vacuity goes unnoticed in favor of the
simulacrum of a maternal matrix, episteme.

The depth _appears_ in general to be around 3-4 mm, between 1/8" and 1/6".
This gives the apparent _thickness_ of the layers as well; one might guess
sheets of tourmaline, opal...

HTML is like house-construction, bottom up, almost always framed between
<> and </> - this _spanning_ also creates the appearance of a _bounded
entity._ Boundary-layers, in fact, jeweled facets - everything measured
against your perfect screen, adjusting itself according to semantic mark-
up. The world becomes totality _precisely_ because of bracketing, eidetic
reduction, transcendental phenomenology. The "age-old dream" is complete.
