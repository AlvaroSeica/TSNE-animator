s/m


Think of an s/m as a linkage within a domain presumably consensual, an
information-domain in which information is transmitted. Consider infor-
mation as that which is translatable; in other words, information is
defined by modes of translation. (For this reason, semiotic difference
constitutes information regimes - but there are other such regimes which
may not be semiotic in character). 

The linkage may or may not have a source and receiver, may or may not be
of the order of control. Consider control a linkage in which one actant
directly or indirectly modifies the the domain of another. The nature of
this modification results down the line in a transformation of material
and/or neurophysiological conditions. 

Think of an s/m as ill-defined, partial or part-object, essentially viral
in nature. An s/m is below the memetic level, circulating in the midst of
the order of drives. An s/m is always already theatrical; the stage is
that of the mother-structures which are sub-structural. All communication
begins and ends on this level; all communication participates in the play
of stage and desire.

And think of dispersions as sprays or emissions of s/ms, which may or may
not be packets, may or may not be addressed or addressable, may or may not
be clutter/histories.

We build a model in this way, said Jennifer. Of what, said Nikuko, and "Of
what?" asked Julu and there was little, if any, answer. It was this lack
of response that constituted an s/m, or one of any number of protocols of
constitution...
