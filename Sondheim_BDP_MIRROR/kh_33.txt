Parable of Nikuko aroused so she can no longer read herself, much as she
generates writing


Nikuko asks, why does everything swell up around me when I try to sleep? 
Why do I, Nikuko Daishin walk around with swollen body? (God, walk all
over me!) Do I need to sleep in order to swell? Why am I so rounded? Why
am I haunted in this fashion? Who are you to waken dragon curled between
epidermis and mesodermis? Between flesh and flesh and flesh? Why do curls,
scales, fire, long flickering tongues and fire spell kanji-shapes of bel-
lies, breasts, lips, nipples?  Mouths, mouths, mouths. Why are you there,
distended, tumescent screened on two eyes backed into tortured skin? You
make my body perfect sphere. Arms and legs sink into shoulders and thighs,
face into mouth and neck, thighs into clit. Unknown kanji are lost in
flesh stretched to open to you. I am taut-skin ball, buried writing, sym-
bols, marks, words, speech. I can no longer speak. My mouth
