From Disorders of the Real, 1988:





Something occurs

in air.

What repeats itself, repeats itself in air. What is repetition.



Photographs from the dead to the living. For whatever circulations, dis-

tributions, occur, it is impermissible to descend into metaphor.



Thus the real flutters, signifies chatter, the ego coagulates, and the

formation of a memory occurs which retrojects.



But everything occurs in air, the cities, the brilliant burst of the 

missile or bomb, the atmospherics of a binary star, formations and

patterns.



The air repeats itself

everywhere.



The _I_ has disappeared in the last act of absolving, absolution. The 

_I_ is replaced by blind death which is the balancing act of perception.



The frame, screen, page holds steady momentarily, while the subject, 

that which spills from the surface, changes position erratically.



Things shuffle in the wind. The wind is a self-reflexive transformation

of the atmosphere.



Light spills through the wind; the world rubs up against itself, divided

permanently in the jump cut, sutured in its appearance.



The _I_ in its final absolution has refused the air. The _I_ refuses the

presence of the air.



What is carried in the atmosphere but the technology of death. The atmo-

sphere of death is the self-reflexive transformation of the machine.



Repetition is the alliance. It is the contract. It refuses the presence 

of death. The presence of death is a reincarnation of matter, past the

moment (of the literary) of the living. To refuse its presence is to

refuse (the literary) the living.



What occurs in air is

repetition. What repeats itself is air, atmospherics. What photographs

repeats the air. What photographs repeats it exactly.
