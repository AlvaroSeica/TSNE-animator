what the ancients recognized, that we are ghosts invisible

we are transparent to gaia & transparent to to dark matter,
transparent to neutrinos & transparent to cosmos,
cornered in inflationary universes,
held taut & visible by logics of the surface,
transparent to bacteria, prions, viruses,
mother-father bacteria, slime & molecular soup,
granularities & strings layered upon granularities,
& layers in layers, layers tilted, askew in relation to layers,
& layers interpenetrated, layers corroded, 
& layers imbricated & twisted,
we look at ourselves & see ghosts & name them, unknowing,
we witness ourselves as eternal, obdurate, opaque & historic,
dates sliding against dates & times against times,
& no dates & no times at all, & spaces & no spaces,
& layered spaces, & spaces layered against spaces,
transparent throughout all of them,
all of them transparent throughout,
