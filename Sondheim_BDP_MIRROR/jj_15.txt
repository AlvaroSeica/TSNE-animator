So Rousseau writes this. He gets up with Emile; they go to the computer.
Dear Sophy, they begin, maybe we're dead, maybe you are. Who is to know?
Emile had quite a scare. If I were Raymond Queneau I'd wonder about this.
Emile's only words. So am I for that matter. Who am I writing to? Doesn't
this seem like the oldest story in the world? There's always control in-
volved in a story. That's the masochism everyone talks about. I have no
idea if it has a site, sight, or locus. It's more like a locust, plague
take you everywhere, emitted from the Grund up. You rise, you sink; you
understand. She dies, isn't dead; they're all dead anyway - it's too long
ago. Because I'm a woman, because I'm a woman, they wouldn't like me. I'm
being called to the table. I just wonder and wonder. Who were they? Why
the control? Rousseau buried women in his time. He set the example and
made examples. He reminds me of Hippocrates, Galen. Women are a symptom.
But here, something else is happening. He bursts in the room; he's a
ghost! It's a slow take. They're on the computer; one or another has the
power to delete. They wryte Sophy into just about everything they do.
She's the protocol. She has seven layers, only three of skin. Down there,
the hardware. Beneath the pinafore.

She raises it again and again.
