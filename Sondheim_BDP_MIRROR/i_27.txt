"The Last Judgment, which so tortured the Middle Ages and which our day

has forgotten so absolutely, is no mere invention of selfish and uneducated

monks. The Last Judgment is the supreme reality. In moments - their rare

moments - of illumination - even our positive thinkers feel this. The Last

Judgment decides whether there shall be freedom of will, immortality of

the soul, or not - whether there shall be a soul, or not. And, maybe, even

the existence of God is still undecided. Even God waits, like every living

human soul, on the Last Judgment." (Lev Shestov, In Job's Balances)
