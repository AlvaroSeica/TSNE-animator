The Other Side of the Freighter


We went to Sydney Mines today, North Sydney as well. The Other Side of the
Freighter Aurora was Clearly Visible. Of course, The Freighter May have
Turned Around to Thwart our Geometric Purveyance, but Then I Assume - and
From What Cause - that It would Face the Other Way as well. Or not.... I
will Be Back, there is a Drawing Board Here for My Purveyance.
