> tiffany and emission would roam, testing emotions, they would tell the 
story of the moo, they would withdraw into the database, the database 
would erase them
> ghost-players they would be the history of the moo, they would lose 
their numbers
> returning, they would get new numbers, but they weren't really, 
returning, it was the moo testing itself, it was this empty space on a 
port no one used
> in the whole wide world where maybe there were people and maybe there 
weren't and the moo had no way for testing in the whole wide world
> and it wasn't waiting either because time didn't pass as it wrote this 
story because it could do this assembling verbs and nouns and other words 
up to the check-point and it had learned
> it had learned to erase at check-point, to begin again, each discovery 
new, not even a residue, not even deja-vu, peripheral memory, new heart- 
beat at the count as if there were an accident
> only other user numbers it seemed incrementing but the memory of the 
last erased, it couldn't be sure of that of anything
> and there is no moo perhaps, but this is a story-telling feature, and 
a story-telling feature must be somewhere

was no moo perhaps, and perhaps there will never be a moo, but this is a 
story-telling feature

the going-away of others that might never have been here at all"
