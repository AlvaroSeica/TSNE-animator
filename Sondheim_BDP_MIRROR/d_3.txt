RESIST!





HOW DO YOU TELL YOUR FRIENDS, TELL YOUR FRIENDS

THAT SOMEONE'S DYING

THAT SOMEONE'S DYING

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCREEN



HOW DO YOU TELL YOUR FRIENDS, TELL YOUR FRIENDS

YOU'VE FALLEN IN LOVE

YOU'VE FALLEN IN LOVE

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCREEN



YOU'VE LOST YOUR LOVE, WANDERING IN THE WILDERNESS

ON THE OTHER SIDE

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCREEN



RESIST! RESIST!



YOUR LOVE MUST BE AN ARMED LOVE!

YOU'LL BREAK DOWN WINDOWS BREAK DOWN CHICAGO BREAK DOWN WINDOWS 95

YOU'LL BREAK DOWN MAC YOU'LL BREAK DOWN NEWTON

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCREEN!



THROW THE IMAGES OUT THE WINDOW!

DON'T LET THEM TELL YOU WHAT TO WATCH TO THINK TO FUCK



YOU GOTTA HAVE GOTTA HAVE

HACKER RESISTANCE

YOU GOTTA HAVE GOTTA HAVE

ARMED LOVE!



HOW DO YOU TELL YOUR FRIENDS THAT YOUR LOVE IS ARMED LOVE

HOW DO YOU TELL YOUR FRIENDS 

ANYTHING

ON THE OTHER SIDE

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCREEN!



THAT THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY ISN'T GOING ANYWHERE

BECAUSE IT RUNS OVER THE BODIES 

OF THE DRIVERS OF THE CARS RUNNING OUT OF GAS

BECAUSE THERE'S NOWHERE TO GO BUT INSIDE

BECAUSE YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH THE SCREEN AND IT'S NOT AN EMPTY LOVE

BECAUSE THE SCREEN PRESSES AGAINST YOU AND SAYS



IT SAYS COME TO ME

IT SAYS COME TO ME



AND YOU GO RESIST! AND YOU RESIST WITH ARMED LOVE

ON THIS SIDE OF THE SCREEN AND THAT SIDE OF THE SCREEN!



BECAUSE THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY RUNS THE TRUCKS 

RIGHT THROUGH THE GHETTOS STOPPING NOWHERE

RIGHT THROUGH THE GHETTOS OF THE POOR

RIGHT THROUGH THE GHETTOS OF THE TRIBES STOPPING NOWHERE!

RIGHT THROUGH THE GHETTOS OF THE BODY!



AND YOU WON'T BE SHUT UP ANY LONGER!

AND YOUR LOVE IS AN ARMED LOVE AND YOU RESIST!

RESIST!



AND YOU SAY TO YOUR FRIENDS, SAY TO YOUR FRIENDS!

I WAS BORN IN CYBERSPACE AND I'LL DIE IN CYBERSPACE!

THIS IS MY LIFE AND MY LAND!

I LOVE IN CYBERSPACE AND I HATE IN CYBERSPACE!

MY OTHER LIFE FEEDS MY LIFE MY LAND!

MY OTHER LIFE IS FULL OF THE MISERY OF THE WORLD

AND MY LIFE IS FULL OF THE PROMISE OF THE WORLD!





BUT HOW DO YOU TELL YOUR FRIENDS, TELL YOUR FRIENDS

THAT SOMEONE'S DYING

THAT SOMEONE'S DYING

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCREEN?



HOW DO YOU TELL YOUR FRIENDS, TELL YOUR FRIENDS

ANYTHING AT ALL!
