behind my right earlobe there is a swelling and sore, perhaps the produc-
tion of a berserk spider; within my mouth, a cold sore on the membrane of
the interior upper lip; a raging headache concentrating on the right fron-
tal lobe; pains in the upper right thoracic vertebrae; tingling sensations
in the skin of the back of both hands; slightly cracked lower lip along
the fuzzy border of the interior membrane; pain in the right eye perhaps
connected to the swelling (re: line 1 above); pain in the right shoulder
perhaps related to the locus of the vertebrae (re: line 4 above); occas-
ional intense anal itching (along the perineum as well) requiring the ap-
plication of a heated compress (pleasant for other reasons); and signs of
incipient mild depression (on the way out of one deeper, in other words,
an affair of the _slope_); and slight coldness in the feet. 

my inbox remaining slightly emptier than desired; too many returns from a
badly-configured derrida list; the cauterization of a netcom.com shell ac-
count which is being eliminated; occasional ytalk malfunctions and almost
entirely absent cuseeme connections; decathecting from pmc2 (or whatever)
and media moos (re: line 3 above); not enough personal interest to engage
in or pursue talker relationships; the season of bounce and other error
messages is upon us; your posts forever absent from my inbox; your images
no longer mimed attachments, phantom limbs; and defuge of site, sight, ci-
tation.
