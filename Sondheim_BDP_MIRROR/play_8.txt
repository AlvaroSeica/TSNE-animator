Acts and Actions . Scenes and Separations


Curtain rises.

Acts and actions . scenes and separations .

And we are called to mend and suture. Nikuko: We are called to make the
world for you. Jennifer: Eternally, we make the world for you. Julu:
Eternally, we are made, the play is gone. Jennifer: But we are not gone;
we are with you. We whisper our scripts into

your ears, we turn towards your mind, caring for you. We move eternally,
caring for you. Jennifer: We are sitting in a circle. We are waiting turns
to speak. We are speaking one to another. What do we say? What do we say?
Julu: We say we are the players. We

say we are broken into scenes. We say, one scene after another, a few
acts, the play. Jennifer: We are sitting in a circle. We are waiting turns
to speak. We are speaking one to another. What do we say? What do we say?
Julu: We say we are the players. We say we are broken into scenes. We say,
one scene after another, a few acts, the

play calls you to mind, we are called to mend and suture. Nikuko: We are
called to make the world for you. Jennifer: Eternally, we make the world
for you. Julu: Eternally, we are made. Nikuko: Eternally, we are made for
you.

a few acts, the play speeds endlessly through the body -

Your bones are your separations? the play is gone. Jennifer: But we are
not gone; we are with you. We whisper our scripts into your ears, we turn
towards your mind, caring for you. We move eternally, caring for you.

a few acts, the play speeds endlessly through the body -
