Problematic issues of ontology of virtual worlds: mathesis/inscription -
what is; the world is a world only by virtue of its (visible, sensed) 
manifestation. In virtual worlds, information may be classified, trans- 
formed, and lost - there is always server roll-back or backup. Backup 
implies an epistemological/ontological split between the (visual, aural, 
etc.) presentation of the data-base, and its physical backup - as both 
medium and data.
