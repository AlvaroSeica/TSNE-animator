(LW5), by Jennifer


I must explain that I go to the arcade and I put my twent-cent piece in
and I enter a world. It's made just for me and is very large and I can
roam as much time as I want. Then I leave the arcade with new dreams and
things to think about and sometimes there's gravity.

I know the world is real and that it continues without me because I am
very poor. I do not have so very many twenty-cent pieces and there are
other things I must use them for.

Sometimes I suffer defuge and then it goes lackluster and the worlds are
tarnished a great deal. I think they must always be that way because I do
not think I am special and they would lackluster just for me.

These little worlds seem very sad, but I do not know they are little and
how can a world be sad? A world just is, and I know it is very real.

Now I will play in my pinafore.
