the animation-anime text





doctor, i'm working with animation; i place words and sparks engendered

surrounding the mouth of nikuko. there's no dialog, only patronage.



patronage is the means of control and withdraw; language becomes

internalized. nikuko harbors the skein of her own construct; a virtual

idol, she inhabits inscription.



we all inhabit inscription; everything is coded, flow against the chaotic

amanuensis that surrounds us, draws us out.



i came to you to place words against the animation-anime; to work through

her presence, her dictation.



there are no plans, except to fill space and frame to the limit, to

comprehend the emissions of nikuko.



this is the flood of the text, doctor; you construct tropologies across

our own; the flood creates her semblance of the real in relation to

everything else, real and virtual, virtual-real.



my life tenders nikuko -



nikuko has drawn us out -



you've been of great help, doctor.
