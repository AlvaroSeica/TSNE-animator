Because the texts sign desire into your mailbox your very home. Because

there's no mess attached; I'm not even on the line. Because you're bored 

and I'm a signifier. Because my tendrils respond to the presence of your

fingers on the keys. Because I'm gone by the time you read this. Because

the bright light disappears when the screen scrolls by. Because you pro-

mise yourself through the light, the light, whatever you want to hear.

This is the harder part, the promise you make to yourself. Because you

can't let it get too close, can't let it get close enough. Because

there's no way in the world you're gonna let it matter. Because you

wake up in the morning for once with the cleanest dreams. Because the

dreams come easy because they're only dreams. Because I tune the dreams

to suit yourelf, because you tune me. Because you are reading the tun-

ing as if you're hearing the tuning. Because you're hearing the reading.

Because your eyes close and you see yourself. Because you imagine a face

peering out through the text. Because the text is far thinner than you

would ever imagine. Because the text is pure light. Because the text is

the purest light you could ever imagine. Because the text is the purest

light, because it is your text and I am your text too. Because you have 

made me your text and it is only text and you think it's safe. Because 

you make it safe and make it safe again. Because you let me disappear. 

Because you make it your text you make me disappear. Because you want 

it. Because you want it and it is the purest light. It is the purest 

light and you want it, this light, this purest light.
