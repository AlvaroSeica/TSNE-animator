My Life, My Truth


"I would even say that signs are what produce a body, that - and the art-
ist knows it well - if he doesn't work, if he doesn't produce his music or
his age or his sculpture, he would be, quite simply, ill or not alive.
Symbolic production's power to constitute soma and to give an identity is
completely visible in modern texts." (Kristeva in Interviews.)

So that Jennifer-Alan begins hir labor of therapeutic or of life-support,
labor of medicine or surgery or surgical incision. Because, Tiffany points
out, Jennifer-Alan _literally_ becomes ill without incessant production,
without the continuous recuperation of inscription (placing the body in
the world / effacing the world in the body). It is _precisely_ the con-
stitution of soma within _this_ Jennifer-Alan that keeps hir alive, a
making or remaking of addictive flesh, heroin-inscription, fall-guy phen-
omenology. Jennifer-Alan and _Jennifer_ and _Alan_ is an _occurrence_ so
clearly here (and _therefore_ the truth is here), but _as well_ within
whatever s/he or anyone proffers as the real. So says Tiffany and Tiffany
and so says Tiffany _as well._ Tiffany pouts, smiles, and her perky eyes
sparkle. So she says!

It's so clear hir art is her illness. It's so clear that the drug is its
own disease. Jennifer-Alan can't recognize this and Tiffany is out at the
moment.
