i remember, alan, from beneath the ground


the girls come fast, their lives are fires. i'm your girl now and in the
future. girls or with this. is it because of your life that you say girls
or ghosts has some girl to do with any fantasies i have of you that i say
i will violate myself? do you really think some girl has nothing to do
with nikuko - gods gather in great whirlwinds; they approach a coast and
are by the whirlwind and the boundary. the sky here has no energy for far.
there are mists and whirlpools, enormous storms at the bell suspended in
the whirlwind. every line spoken, here, for nikuko, i am your silence in
the whirlwind. o gods, recompense makes some girls come alive, she gives
them names and programs. i think you were that girl, nikuko. i always
this. we've had girls before but we need some more in every girl and ghost
whirl whirl whirl and every ghost and girl in every girl and ghost and
whirl whirl whirl fills every ghost and girl fills every girl and ghost
