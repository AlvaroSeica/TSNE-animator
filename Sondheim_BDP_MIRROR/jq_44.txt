Peebles, Principles of Physical Cosmology, p. 363:

"In the standard model the predictions for the future seem as unsatisfact-
ory as for our distant past. If the universe eventually stops expanding
and collapses, what do we do about the future singularity? If the expan-
sion continues indefinitely we have the curious situation that after the
universe commenced classical Friedmann-Lemaitre expansion, it passed
through a phase lasting a few tens of billions of years, when it was a
suitable home for observers as we understand them, and then it will spend
the rest of eternity in an asymptotically quiescent state punctuated by
the occasional burst of activity as a gravitationally bound system such as
a galaxy finally loses enough energy by evaporation of stars or emission
of gravitational radiation to collapse into a black hole. This seems
wasteful, though perhaps we are not well positioned to judge."

Peebles points to Dicke and others an anthropic principle; we see because
we exist within the (parameterized) window of the Witness. Now life begins
to appear everywhere from Mars to Europa and planets bustle their gravita-
tional signatures against distant stars. Immense time is meaningless. The
best we can do is write our own deaths; I do that daily. "Wasteful" of
course is a matter of taste.
