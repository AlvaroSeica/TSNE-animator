Cheat


This is a complicated course to chart, but thinking recently about _chea-
ting_ has been productive; a magazine article pointed out its prevalence
and relation to mimicry, and it seems a universal moment in terms of con-
siderations of gender-swapping on the Net. 

Cheating is a form of _passing,_ and this passing is based in similitude
of a part for the whole; _something,_ some _punctum,_ must appear as
_something else,_ something normative, previously assigned within the
sememe of one or another organism. Thus cheating is based on the metonym-
ic, and this opens a realm of investigation, flexing metonymy as a _dis-
solution_ of the real, and metaphor as a recuperation. 

The metonymic slides across the theoretic, as the locus of both empathetic
magic and the fetish, and again _standing-in_ is paramount, the operations 
of surface appearances, translucencies, dismemberments, disembodiments. 
One could assign a calculus, in fact, to this, a primary semiotics, of the 
order of Thom's work on catastrophic linguistics.

One can _see_ where this is going, towards the thetic or originary of the
symbolic, the _coagulation_ of the real through inscription, and emergence
of entity. 

_Cheating_ is thus a _forking_ as well, against which an implicit rhetoric
of ethics is constructed, as if the metonymic were in fact _fixed,_ on or
within the order of proper names as rigid designators. To _cheat_ is to
reaffirm the possible, and language itself is born from an inessential
corruption.
