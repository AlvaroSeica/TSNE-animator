X-Ray to My Heart





Scientific American has two x-ray pictures of the sun. 

They are so brilliant! So malevolent!

I can't look at them because I think the sun will come and get me!



Mayakovsky was so happy because he found his true love. He wrote:



A furious sun !

How you beat down on my love !

She's not here cause she's living in the mountains !

It's the same sun she sees I guess so we'll tongue

you together !

Nyaaaah! Nyaaaah!



A furious sun !

No smith has beaten iron with a rock like you and me !

Everything falls into place !

My heart bends to your commands that I seek her

falling over myself on this bewildered planet !



A furious sun !

My sun ! With x-ray vision you have grown so large,

illuminating the interior of each and every thought!

The wires burn with your murky embrace !

So what happened to the revolution, eh !

Tell me that, O furious sun !



( But I won't be around to listen ! 

I've got better things to do.

Thanks to you, I've got better things to do ! )
