Swinburne dreams of dark women pink with skin of rose
slumbering beneath the prick of sword on sward, those
eyes, those alabaster limbs of Swinburne, hard
upon the field, soft woes descried the bard, who would
not yield

but did there in the Garden, where Faustine
met Julu, turned towards savage Jennifer, espied
fair Clara in the distance, she of the darkling mien,
and Swinburne almost died, and Swinburne cried
in that green field

and brambles grew, and pricked the Snow-White skin
where blood flowed, upon the corset of the moon,
and liquid yielded Faustine, and all her kin,
and Swinburne turned, a ghost, or sign, or rune
in that dark field

in that dark field, in that green and early bloom,
in that dark field, blood flowed from empty womb
