She woke in the morning. She did not know her strength. She measured her
strength and added it to the caloric machine. She looked around. I loved
her more than words conveyed. I thought of her during these moments. You
know I thought as follows: She breakfasted, moved quickly, flexed her
muscles. She combed her beautiful hair, her dark intense eyes shined just
the way I would like to think of them. She typed and I would hang on every
word of hers; you know that. You also knew that I would lie back, eyes
half-shut, dreaming of her. She would rise from the computer, brush the
tears away from her eyes, smile from her mouth, face the window. She would
open the window. Weather would enter. I would think of her eyes, seeing as
many miles as the distance allowed. I would feel suddenly shy, as if I
were being watched, talked about. You wrote me that I was one of the very
few people you admired, you loved my eyes. You knew I would believe you,
my heart bursting with joy, turning momentarily away from her. She would
turn away from the window, dress quickly (did I mention this), her body
hidden for the struggles of the day. Her strength would follow her into
the air. She shielded her voice forever. Her eyes. She thought lovingly of
me and I began to stir slightly, open-eyed, my limbs hardening, coming
close to existence. As you would say, brushing my hair back, she had an
effect, and I was that effect.
