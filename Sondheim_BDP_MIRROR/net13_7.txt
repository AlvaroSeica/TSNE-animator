DRAWN FORTH THE HARD ONE



From P.J. Harvey I draw the thread of the body at ten degrees from

the vertical.



From Heidegger, I draw the path in the woods, and from Irigaray, the

flood. From Kristeva, I draw the Flood.



I draw packets from the theory of infinitesmials, and from the

linguistic structure of Old Hittite, the reverse syntactic framework

of the Query. From Derrida, I draw the query.



From the touch last of your hands, your hands riven against me, 

my eyes, my lips; from your last glance backwards drawn away on an 

rainy day, I draw Jacques Prevert and autumn leaves, draw your body 

through the wires.



I draw the memory of that body upon the desert of Jabes, circular 

paths on the way from water to water.



From Nicole Brossard, I draw my body forth, and from Kathy Acker, 

I offer it so thoughtlessly drawn, and drawn away.



From theory, I draw the natural, and from nature, I have drawn theory,

in and out of order. And from anthracite seams in Pennsylvania, I have 

drawn and erased the obdurate of the real. 



From the Ancients, I have drawn the value of exact discourse, held

steadfast in an era of sparse population, communication at the speed

of a horse or railroad locomotive. I have seen words in combinations 

precise with history, the distance between them constituting a portal, 

from the language into the language.



And now, I see the computer reproducing the secret writing of childhood.

The screen returns to you in the form of a gift, the resurrection of

language at the faintest murmur of the breath, the proof positive of

wounded life, and the suturing of that wound: O, something remains!



O, something remains!
