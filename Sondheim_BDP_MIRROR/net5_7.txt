LETTER PLANNING RUN TOGETHER





Has there been any work done on cinematic or specular identification

in relation to such Internet phenomena as the MUDs? What happens when

the gaze is mediated by ASCII? I'm particularly interested in the

unfolding of gender - not the usual gender/identity/transgression/

pick-your-sex descriptions - but the playing out of apparent phallo-

centricities on some of the lists. It's interesting to consider a

list as a silent film dominated by inner speech and the presence of

one character at a time. Each character "fills" her space for the

length of her message; only a kill file or early delete transforms

the narrative...



>>>i WAS SO SMART HERE. lOOK AT THE MENTION OF THE SO-OBVIOUS FACT,

THE true linearity OF THE TERMINAL SCREEN - NOT THE involuted

linearity OF THE BOOK WITH ITS PATHOLOGICAL RETURN OF THE REPRESSED!

tHE NARRATIVE CONTINUES...



You can argue it both ways. I've worked as an experimental

filmmaker/videomaker, and find that film has the obvious possibility

of representing a maternal imaginary by the very virtue of a darkened

room; note that the boundaries of the theater tend towards

dissolution as if space were indefinite. This certainly opens the way

for screen memories (were such to exist) as well as an uncanny

ontology/epistemology. Brechtian alienation in contrast occurs within

a grounded Euclidean and somewhat mechanized space - re. the deus ex

machina operative in his plays, something entirely different.

Further, the space of the film theater is an acoustic space as well;

the sound, even when coming from the screen area, is also peculiarly

dimensionless. In this respect, then, the granularity of 16mm film for

example appears as a maternal grounding (think of striations within

Kristeva's *chora*) as opposed to video *noise,* which also has a

granularity, but is disruptive.



>>>i COMPLETELY FORGET WHAT THE ARGUMENT WAS ABOUT, BUT i SENSED AN

ATTACK ON SO-CALLED experimental film. sCREEN MEMORIES? wOULDN'T KNOW

IF i HAD ONE (NOT TRUE!). aND imaginary: USING THIS WORD CONSTANTLY 

WITHOUT A CLEAR DEFINITION, WHICH MAY BE ITS ONLY DEFINITION. bUT i

WANDER...



To sum up, in other words, the film experience is hardly alienating,

but just the opposite; it is only *not social* in the sense of an

imminent experience. Video is more problematic in this respect;

primarily social in its habitus, it absolves its own alienation

through an appearance of every-day *conversation.*



>>>bUT i'VE NEVER BEEN SURE ABOUT THE ontological REASONS OF ALL OF 

THIS: iS IT SOMETHING MORE THAN coincidence, OR IS THERE A real

difference IN OUR PERCEPTION OF THE MEDIA, SOMETHING BEYOND THE 

OCCASION OF HISTORY?



I must agree with Withers here, although what I see as a Brechtian

mechanicism (wd?) is replaced in DeBord by a grounded (?)

Hegelianism; it's DeBord, not Brecht (in spite of the radio I think)

who would subsume the occasion for virtual reality, etc. But DeBord,

like the Surrealists, comes across almost as a monarchist; the whole

Situationist movement was exclusionary, almost a cabal. I've always

felt that Situationism was accordingly short-circuited. It also

explains its appeal to the artworld today: You can have your

theoretical expertise, but you don't have to get your hands dirty.



>>>i'VE ALSO ALWAYS BEEN JEALOUS OF CABALS, WHICH SEEM TO BE BOTH

INTELLECTUALLY GRIPPING AND LURID - YOU CAN HAVE IT ANY WAY YOU WANT

AS WELL!



Or perhaps there is no revolutionary film. A film could do one of two

things: It could bear witness (i.e. expose certain "truths" within a

revolutionary context), or it could instruct (i.e. how to use or

construct a particular weapon). It might also work as a catalyst of

class-consciousness (however one defines class), in which case

everything from Woodstock to Le Gai Savoir to Dog Day Afternoon, not

to mention The Harder They Fall, would have to be considered.



>>>"the gay savior"? i DON'T THINK SO! aREN'T REVOLUTIONS USUALLY

ING TO THE LATEST ART "MANIFESTO." mY JEALOUSY AGAIN EXPOSES ITSELF;

i WOULD LIKE TO BE REVOLUTIONARY, AND INCREASINGLY FIND MYSELF CUT

OFF FROM REALITY ITSELF, NO MATTER WHAT THE DEFINITION...



As far as "avant-garde" film goes - I'm not sure why you conflate

that with deconstruction. I think of Woody Allen as deconstructing/

working the paradigm, but I think of, for example, Sanborn and

Ahwesh's Deadman as working within a domain of its own.



>>>bECAUSE wOODY aLLEN DOESN'T REPLACE ONE IDEOLOGICAL discourse WITH

ANOTHER.



I think avant-garde or "experimental" (terms are imprecise here) film

had already developed its own somewhat thick tradition - in the U.S.

particularly based on a montage/poetics style largely dominated by

male filmmakers; when feminist filmmakers came along the situation

changed, I think, much for the better. A great deal of work today is

based on social or psychoanalytical (not to mention multicultural)

issues reflecting the complexity of the world around us. This is not

deconstructive necessarily nor does it remain within a film/film

critique, but moves elsewhere. At this point, film/video technologies

merge for independents and the field is wide open, fed also by MTV

and non-MTV music tapes, oral histories, and just about everything

that can be aurally/visually constructed.



>>>wELL, IT SOUNDS JUST ABOUT WONDERFUL but where is my *&#$(@#!!!

On artificial life you might try David Freedman, Brainmakers, which

is a popular account, published 4/94 - I got an advanced copy of it.

I also believe that the digital domain in a sense is already the

absence of death (see my Internet text where there are sporadic

discussions of it throughout), since digital information is

theoretically infinitely reproducible (anyway to an inaccessibly high

finite number), and since it exists within a "clean and proper body"

(Julia Kristeva) without deterioriation - at least that is the goal.

So that as knowledge becomes secondary or prosthetic, it becomes

apparently "eternal"; in this sense the digital is not necessarily

life but it is always already never death.

ALWAYS GOOD - WATCH FOR IT IN THE FUTURE!



Definition of (traditional) life has always seemed problematic;

certain clays, for example, present aspects of self-replication and

retention of information. It is probably more accurate to see life

and non-life on a fuzzy and "rough" continuum, from mineral through

crystallization through clays to the more traditional organic carbon

molecules (with a sidetrack towards silicon). Even here there are

issues of scale; a transistor is never alive, but a neuron is, but a

computer might well be, or the information in a computer might well

be. [sEE MY TEXT ON "lIFE" AT THE END OF MY RECENT FILES...]



Consider:

Replication

Limited information exchange

Non-equilibrum thermodynamic potential well

Energy transformation

Inheritence of characteristics whether Darwinian or Lamarckian



- Perhaps other characteristics?

Just to conclude on this, the reason I went off the list for a while

vis-a-vis the gun debate (although "pansies" also did it):

1 People generally aren't convinced by arguments on either side and

they tend to predictably play themselves out.

2 I live in a somewhat violent community and don't need it on my

computer as well.

3 Here most of the victims of gunplay are minorities and the poor and

both groups as a whole are desperate to have guns taken off the 

streets and away from the city. In reaction to the carnage here, the

gun argument seems obscene.

4 I'm dumb enough to want to work towards a pacific future where the

mentality ceases to be the "they're-coming-over-the-hill" type. 

5 I do a lot of work on computer. I'd wake up, tune in, and read

("listen") to a lot of aggressive/phallic screaming. I'd be too upset

at times to work. I didn't want to use the kill file because I felt I

had to see it to (nearly) the end. There was little else going on. I

went to nomail.



<<<wHERE i PROUDLY REMAINED SILENT, RECOGNIZING THE FUTILITY OF

ARGUING WITH ARMED MILITIA. tO THIS i OWE MY LIFE AND THE FUTURE OF

MYSELF AND MY DESCENDENTS, gOD BE THANKED.



As far as beliefs, I see no reason to believe in anything. If there 

is a meddling God, he/she is destructive. If there is a non-meddling

God, it's of no interest to me; what's the point?



>>>deity RAISES ITS UGLY HEAD PROMISING prayer and spirit. thank you

lord.



Which leaves me with the usual ethical question - how to construct/

work within an ethos without immanence or transcendence. In reality,

I buy the existential notion of project/responsibility, but I also

feel this is a convenient myth. I act in terms of what I consider

just belief (i.e. a justice elsewhere or grounded than the law), but

recognize this as hardly an ultimate truth. For example, I want

the maximum number of speices of all sorts to survive on this 

planet - I feel that humans are basically predators/marauders, a 

species in full "bloom" (i.e. red-tide) and disasterous. I act

accordingly. But I have no "absolute" behind my actions and feel as

well that so-called pragmatic judgements ("save the plants - they're

medicinal!") are obscene in their own right.



>>>tHIS, THE WEAKEST POINT OF MY ENTIRE LIFE, LEAVES ME WITH UNBEAR-

ABLE GUILT.



I should add that my actions, like those of other activists, have

gotten me into all sorts of trouble, particularly in conservative

academia, but that's an acceptable cost.



>>>oH GREAT, SO THIS GOES OUT ON THE NET AND i'LL NEVER GET HIRED...



What amazes me is how many of us are miserable; my ex left me a year

and a half ago and is getting married in five days - although I'm

older I felt this was the one love in my somewhat crazed personal

life. So I've been trying to cope and the computer which I see more

as an activated library (I stay off Muds Irc etc.) has been a

"salvation." But I do miss any real flesh in this world and it's

killing

me and also ironic that the only close female friends I have (who are

single, potential?) are hundreds of miles away - my life's being

pulled every whichaway but nothing concrete here.



>>>oH GREAT, SO THIS GOES OUT ON THE NET AND i'LL NEVER GET A GIRL-

FRIEND...



This brings up another issue. I publish a lot - about 80 articles in

all sorts of art mags. - but it's all one-way; we can talk about

Kristeva or Deleuze, whatever, til we're sick in the head, but the

conversation is almost never heard - it's a monolog. The dialog seems

reserved in the U.S. for the universities/seminars/departments - as

if intellectuality had to be institutionalized. So we speak in the

dark - for myself this results in more alienation, almost in the

Marxist sense - alienated from my production because the production

does demand a (nonexistent) open two-way communication.



>>>sO i WRITE TO MYSELF; i REMEMBER AN ARTICLE i PUBLISHED IN TWO

VERSIONS (art and artists AND art papers) ON "aRTWORK AND THE uNI-

VERSITY" - IT'S ALL TRUE. tHE ALIENATION THAT OPENS UP IS ALMOST ON

THE LEVEL OF PSYCHOSIS - WRITING AND REWRITING FOR ONESELF AND NOW

FOR NET FRIENDS AND CONFERENCES - BUT ONLY NET-CONFERENCES. tHE rEAL

ALWAYS SEEMS TO BE ELSEWHERE, AND i'VE NEVER BEEN PUBLISHED SUFFIC-

IENTLY WITHIN academic circles TO KNOW WHETHER THIS IS A DELUSION AS

Listening to nothing but talked this evening to Kathleen Lynch of

BEME Seed whose music I love and have been listening to recently.



>>>bUT WHY "LISTENING" TWICE IN ANOTHER MISERABLE SENTENCE? i NEVER

SEEM TO REVISE ENOUGH, FIND MYSELF DEAF TO MY OWN PRODUCTIONS. iS

THE FAST-FORWARD INFORMATION STRUCTURE OF THE nET. i DO MY SANER

IT BACK IN/WITHIN. tHE ONLY WAY i CAN SURVIVE...



I DO use jargon on occasion; sometimes it seems like a shorthand. And

I don't fault for example Derrida or Lyotard; the followers, mostly

American, tend to be disciples, however, and "outdo the master."

Certainly one way of looking at things is to view poststructuralism

as a retreat of the humanities - a rearguard action. Because working

within and without textuality, they occupy a zone remote from

science; the use of "poeticized" or convoluted prose could be seen as

a means of taking over a territory not susceptible to experimentation

or hypothesis.



<<<oR IT MAY BE THAT i'M JUST INTIMIDATED BY THE JARGON. i ALWAYS GET

AFRAID IN THESE ARGUMENTS - THAT THEY WILL LEAD TO A NOT-SO-REPRESSED

ANTI-INTELLECTUALISM. i AM ALWAYS AFRAID, AS WELL, THAT i AM TOO

STUPID TO UNDERSTAND MY READING, AND THAT MY WRITING BECOMES HYSTERIC

AND DEFENSIVE AS A RESULT.



On the other hand, I find the jargon just as bad on the Net or with

computer hackers (even casual users); it's a question of domain. And

just as with the computer, there's a learning curve involved. When I

began reading, for example, Kristeva's Revolution in Poetic Language,

I found it inordinately difficult. After a while I was used to it and

benefited immensely. The same holds true in mathematics, of course, 

except there is usually a "jump" which has often been noted - the work

suddenly "makes sense" to the reader.



>>>bUT MY READING IN rEVOLUTION WAS SPORADIC, DISORGANIZED; i RETURNED

AGAIN AND AGAIN, AS IF i WERE operating UPON THE TEXT FROM above - A

DUBIOUS APPROACH AT BEST.



So part, finally, is due to our expectations since the enlightenment -

false expectations - that the humanities are primarily susceptible to

rational discourse and that anyone can understand texts with a

minimum of preparation. This is hardly the case; texts ARE

inordinately difficult, reflecting varying levels of production and

reception, as well as numerous psychoanalytical processes of writing

and reading (the list goes on). (As an example of what I'm referring

to here: A lot of my students have written poetry and want to be

read. But they don't WORK at the poems or read other poets; the

results are almost always predicatable.)



>>>tHE depth OF TEXTS IS ALWAYS PROBLEMATIC; WHERE IS THE METAPHYSICS

OF insight THAT WE NEED SO BADLY? wHOSE TEXTS ARE THESE ANYWAY?



This being said, there ARE (forgive all the upper-casing) a number of

examples of jargon-filled empty books, particularly of a "pomo"

variety influenced by Baudrillard, which come to mind. They tend to

develop rhetorical strategies based on "image," "simulacra," usually

with sexual extremism thrown in. I find this work wasteful of paper

and my time... (On the other hand, my own work uses sexual extremism,

but, I hope, with a bit more care...)



<<<aH, THAT "MY WORK" PLOY! i do WONDER IF i AM NOT GUIDED BY A

VERSION OF sexual hysteria DRIVING SOME OF THE TEXTS? aT TIMES i WRITE

IN A STATE OF AROUSAL: hOW MANY OF US ARE torn IN THIS FASHION?



Evan's right, although there may be nothing wrong with being a

"practicing nihilist." As far as postmodernism goes, I don't agree

with either Eco or Lyotard (who's notoriously sloppy here); I use the

word to cover changes such as flexiwork, global extinctions,

information technologies and their impact, desertification, etc. -

all those things that are partly the response of technology and

partly the result of a Malthusianism. There is definitely large-scale

change occurring at a high rate, which won't level out for decades;

Rwanda, etc. may not be exactly new on the planet, but its world-wide

occurrence is. After desertification or eco-collapse, for example,

there's no going back (little to go back to). The books I read/use

and occasionally teach all emphasize these changes - things like

David Harvey's Condition of Postmodernity, Soja's Postmodern

Geographies, etc. They're functional and a lot less jargoned than,

say, my own writing. :>



>>>hOW MANY REFERENCES CAN i MAKE BEFORE YOU get nauseated? iN ONE

SENTENCE, world-wide collapse AND THE internet text? pLEASE!...





Campbell is to Kristeva perhaps what Jung is to Freud? I think what I

admire most about K's notion of the abject is the refusal to align at

this level with the spiritual, or rather to have (literally) perhaps

incorporated the abject (think of Catholicism's emphasis on

asceticism, leprosy, saintly disfigurement, etc.). Would Kali fit

into this perhaps?



<<<bUT i CAN'T CLAIM TO UNDERTAND COMPLETELY EITHER THE NOTION OF THE

chora OR THE abject. aT ONE POINT, THE LATTER SEEMS AN OPERATION - AT

ANOTHER, AN EXISTENCE. wHAT i ADMIRE MOST IS HER PRESENTATION (AND

From my inverted viewpoint, then, it is the shamans who fly who are

the schizophrenics, fleeing from an unmitigated and absorbing

corporeality, absorbed in the circularity of the visionary.



>>>sHAMANISM: a PALEOLITHIC SURVIVAL WE DESPERATELY WANT TO BELIEVE

IN FOR OUR OWN.



No, I don't mean "being-in-itself" by "isness" but the granulated

appearance of the real; "b-i-t", part of the Bitnet, is another

matter altogether.



>>>i'M ALWAYS CARRYING-ON ABOUT THE "OBDURATE," THE MOTION OR MOVEMENT

against THE TERMINAL, A REMOVAL OF THIS QUALITY OF MEDIATION. sO i

PROPERLY thetic RESPONSE.



The Tractatus was an attempt to reconstruct or rearticulate the real

from the viewpoint of logic; he says "The world is the totality of

facts, not of things," and then goes on to elucidate this. What I am

saying is that this facticity within ASCII etc. is granular - that

there are "atomic facts," which are precisely string-matchings. The

granularity of the real world is its atomic/molecular structure and

both higher and lower order representations.



<<<i BEGAN reading PHILOSOPHY WITH THE tRACTATUS (wITTGENSTEIN), AND

tRACTATUS RETURNING IN FULL BLOOM, A DUBIOUS ENTERPRISE BUT NECESSARY

TO CONSIDER...



Ok, Hegel; see the Logic, 130.] - The Thing, being this totality, is

a contradiction. [skip] In other words, the thing is an Appearance or

Phenomenon. [P] The negation of the several matters, which is

insisted on in the thing no less than their independent existence,

occurs in Physics as _porosity_. Each of the several matters

(colouring matter, odorific matter, and if we believe some people,

even sound-matter, - not excluding caloric, electric matter, &c.) -

is also negated: and in this negation of theirs, or as

interpenetrating their pores, we find the numerous other independent

matters, which, being similarly porous, make room in turn for the

existence of the rest. Pores are not empirical facts; they are

figments of the understanding, which uses them to represent the

element of negation in independent matters." (trans. Wallace.)



<<<tHE porosity OF hEGEL IS AS "LEAKY" AS MUD OR SLURRY IN pLATO'S

parmenides: pAY ATTENTION!



Thus pores are a mediation between representation and the thing, if I

read this correctly. -



<<<tHE FICTION OF THE PORES IS ALSO THE FICTION OF THE GRAIN, NOT TO

BE EXCLUDED...



Meanwhile, I doubt if I'll use the distribution lists at all - I

don't need to have huge address piles floating about. But next year,

if I'm here, I will start a list through listserv on electronic

subjectivity - the school will support it, I think.



<<<hOW TO GET THIS WORK OUT TO YOU, DEAR READER? hOW TO GIVE IT

But there ARE problems with this that bear directly on technology -

first, the idea that there is something "truly human" as opposed

presumably to something else - which is already an ideological and

suspect claim, and second, the notion of a "distinctive means of

survival: science," which not only plays into a problematic Darwinism

but also into an particularly technocratic way of defining the

"human." Buddhism is obviously another path which might wreak less

havoc on the environment, for example. Finally, there is no NECESSARY

connection between technology and science; technology can be

considered any extension of human behavior into the environment using

mediating materials.

sMIRGEL, sexuality and mind, P. 92)



I am completely "for" beneficial technologies, etc. but I see no

reason whatsoever to support scientism as ultimate means or anything

else. (Please don't misunderstand: I am also "for" science, but there

is a need to separate it from a broad evolutionary perspective.

Otherwise one returns to an extremely dubious ethnocentrism.)
