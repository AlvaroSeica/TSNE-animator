Wounded Avatars 


"when i was young i was told i wouldn't live past twenty-five.
i gave the ugly lie to that interpretation.
now these words resonate but only briefly with my voice.
you'll read them in your own, nothing otherwise will remain.
the back-theory is that fragile, look how the letters line up.
one, two, and three, they appear different to you 
than they ever did to me."

Wounded avatars are inconceivable; however what is transmitted across - 
from the visualization of the data-base to the user - may reflect a 
surplus of inscription.

This is accomplished in at least two ways: 1. the augury and presence of 
the human voice, as voice-over or apparently emanating from the avatar, 
whose movement of the lips can reflect the pronunciation of the phonemes 
in real time; and 2. the use of photographic textures, of the wounded 
and/or sexualized body, attached to objects and avatars. The first is 
resonant with the 'grain of the voice,' which is easily transmitted 
(occupying a fairly small audio bandwidth, simple to channel and receive) 
and yet perceived as _of_ the body, intimate with and within the body, in 
other words an aural tissue inhering in the speaking subject, and listened 
to, in that regard, by the receiver. The second, the use of photographic 
(photographed) textures, is based on the gaze, and its function as a 
proscenium of arousal and empathy; the body gazed-upon is my own (taken as 
my own, inhabited), the wound and genitals are my own (inhabited), and so 
forth. The silencing of the voice, the portrayal of the death of the body 
are my own as well, and the more obdurate the silencing and portrayal - 
the more these appear to deny the epistemology of the data-codecs that are 
at the heart of their transmission - the more the viewer succumbs to them, 
the more they are lodged within the him or hir, the more the flesh appears 
beyond what otherwise defaults to the usual (notion of the) transparency 
of data.

So that, to re-mark within the virtual, within virtual worlds, the 
presence of the body, wounded or aroused or dying for examples - the use 
of voice and texture are useful portals to those journeys we all take at 
various times in our lives, and towards their ending, when the flow of the 
body becomes insistent in its very becoming-object.

In the nightclub, the sleazy can predominate, as can elegance, brilliance, 
glitter, and monstrosity. Imagine a windowless space, dark but for the 
presence of club kids, who emerge as rare birds of the night, a metaphor 
done to death and stereotypical, but clear in its depiction of a menagerie 
which appears self-illuminated, self-controlled, self-presented. In this 
way, ontology is self-determined, what is, is brought to the foreground by 
the club kids themselves; this is the world of the club, the world of the 
night, the world of flat black texture in virtual worlds where what is 
visible is always already a detour or bypass, an inversion of the usual 
roles of light and shadow.

Further, what appears in the nightclub, in this self-illumination, self- 
ontology, is nothing more or less than the image or flash, evanescent and 
always on the verge of disappearing. This image appears simultaneously 
real (for it is there, before me) and virtual (since it seems grounded in 
translucence and the ephemeral; in fact it sutures inscription to the 
flesh, perhaps erring on the side of inscription. For what is occurring 
(but does not occur) within a depth psychology here, is the aging of the 
image-body, body-image, outside the club, which then is visible (as the 
club kid is visible) as a framing-device remote from time, forestalling 
time. The time of the club is always a detour. 

So here is the third device within virtual presentation, beyond voice and 
photographic texture, the device of the glow or self- or narrowed- 
illumination, which isolates and creates, which effaces architecture 
through architectonics, and which insists on the wounded or dying avatar, 
the sick or aroused avatar, the avatar brought to its/our knees at its 
limits, which are the limitations of representation among transmissions, 
codes, protocols, and so forth. 

I can imagine a solitary avatar, whose body is that of carefully-recon- 
structed wounds and violent demarcations, mouthing almost autonomically 
the audible narration of a woman starving in the Horn of Africa, a 
survivor from a Rwandan massacre, a soldier chewed up by a roadside bomb, 
or an American dying from malnutrition; I can imagine an avatar whose body 
is mapped from aroused or used and debilitated flesh, audibly murmuring 
the caress of sexuality, or sexuality's violence... So many difficult and 
un/comfortable modes of presentation, carrying the real of the body into 
the virtual, returning it to the real of the observer, who may become a 
participant in spite of hirself, and for what end? For experience and 
empathy that inhabits the lived world, breaks down virtuality, or better, 
demonstrates that virtuality and inscription inhabit all of us, that it is 
not an escape, that our bodies and desires follow us and paint the world 
in colors which are often abject and denied. I would like famine and war 
brought home to second life, in a semiotic close to the ikonic, not the 
usual cartoon-indexical which all too often colors 'magical' representa- 
tion. I would like arousal to move other than Vaihinger's as-if or Ben- 
tham's fictions, to bring the body and its consequences to the foreground 
(as speech often does). And I'd like death to appear as other than 
commodity as representable in its non-representability; I'd like that 
death to appear as _our_ death, not the death of the other, not the death 
which is named, but the death which is unnameable. And finally, I'd like 
the wager which comes from all of this (and there are other means to apply 
as well, of course; I'm just scratching the surface), to be seen for what 
it is: not a wager in the sense of a zero-sum game, but a wager within the 
real, within organism, where we all are lost in the end, but may have 
moments of clarity and action on the way there. Otherwise we spend our 
lives as separate 'real' and 'virtual,' both skittering across data-banks 
and back-ups, as if such constitute how the world is turning or has 
become. And the danger there is that, to repeat myself, that real war, 
starvation, arousal (it is not all negative), wounding, cessation, is 
always just around the corner, and we ignore this, politically and 
somatically, at our peril.

Wounded Avatars ii


"oh! how we all slide off the end of the earth.
when my mother died, she was always in my thoughts.
now in dreams sometimes, tonight i met her in paris,
perhaps from sweden, she was slightly tipsy, she 
was dressed in white, holding a glass, a white
object, perhaps from a virtual world, nose-cone of
sorts, perched near her, somehow attached, and i said,
i said, mom, i haven't seen you in a while, don't you
remember me 
and she said, she said don't be silly, we saw
each other just a week ago, and then i remembered...

remembering, having woken up, more than a decade ago,
and all these complicities, sliding off and away,
vanishing, sooner, perhaps,
sooner, perhaps, among my siblings or her friends, then
nothing at all, already i am half gone with it, half gone
with despair"

So there are three paths for the woundatar, each a disturbance of virtual 
ontology:
1. The path of the grain of the voice;
2. The path of the photograph as texture;
3. The path of self-illumination and image-imaginary of the nightclub.

These tend towards a return of the somatic; the viewer is engaged, and the 
projectivity/introjectivity matrix or 'jectivity' between the viewer's 
body-subjectivity and the visuality of the virtual is deeply entangled.

They are entangled without the simplicity of mappings which drives so much 
new media or virtual art: for example, the weather mapped through the 
stock-exchange onto musical scales, resulting in an 'interpretation' of 
the planet. Mappings are GIGO, garbage-in, garbage-out; they are the 
result of a paring-away of the abject, of the clarity of thought; and they 
participate in an Enlightenment project which does not admit, for example, 
the abject of the tumor which remains ill-defined and corrosive. 

But it is such an abject that wins at the very end, that appears at the 
end: the wound which refuses to heal, spreading until the body is 
consumed. And how this is brought home, is through the _phenomenology of 
the mess,_ which is the true-real state of the world.

The mess is deep disorder, in both practical and ontological senses. The 
mess absorbs and negates history. The mess is simultaneously everything 
and nothing, rust and dust, corrosion and ill-locution.

(On a practical level, what I've overlooked here, of course, is access and 
mixed-reality; I've been focusing on the two ends of the spectrum, an 
assumed 'real' and an assumed 'virtual.' (Elsewhere, I've shown these 
assumptions are false; the real and virtual are always entangled. So I'm 
speaking of hypothetically-pure states here, nothing more.) Mixed-reality 
brings up a host of interface issues. For the woundatar's problematic of 
ontology, tacit knowledge is a necessity. In other words, having to work 
through or over a complex interface which calls to you as an intermediary, 
disrupts the flow. And flow disruptions is diegetic disruption, which is 
why whole-body insertion into virtual worlds is the psycho-logical end- 
point of development here. But even driving in or inhabiting a virtual 
world for a period of time still runs into the same issues, which is why 
voice, photographic texture, and/or nightclub scenarios are so important. 
(Interestingly, just as voice has grain, so does smell; both are _of_ the 
body in an uncomfortably direct way. But the latter has yet to be 
harnessed anywhere, except as a gimmick.) (On the other hand, think of 
movement directly recorded from injured, paralyzed, or dying people, in 
combination with the three paths mentioned above. The point is, these 
aren't the only possible paths; they're only the most obvious.))

the zurna has a shenai mouthpiece; i'm working on intonation which is 
incredibly difficult for me, but fascinating. these were two short 
independent solos; mixing them shows how similar the envelopes are.

the etc1 piece was recorded at the experimental television center in 
owego, new york. i was on a residency. i hadn't heard the organ for a long 
time; i'm amazed by the strange quality of the sound and chording.

this is the world of the crumbling edifice I leave behind,
 because I say: only edifices crumble, all edifices crumble
the gateways of edifices appear with the clarity of crystals
 and disappear with the radioactivity and trauma of smoky quartz
gateways are neither closed nor open but depend upon stanchions
stanchions are neither vertical nor horizontal but depend upon a
 space-time metric
and it goes and for a moment, I am managing these sounds,
 and for a moment I am offering you an edifice,

the buddha exfoliates, negation cuts into nothing, suzuki's account of the 
crucifix emphasizes not only ego but object; buddha visuddhimagga scrapes 
away at the object until abjection remains; abjection's swept under the 
re: religious purity - the scraping away in buddhism is the scraping away 
of ontology - in the west, epistemology - the resurrection is an issue of 
the episteme, contract, how do we know what we know etc. - tantric 
initiation is the _other hand_ of ontology - it's a move from the ikonic 
to the imaginary - w/ resurrection from the ikonic to the symbolic - in 
the virtual world you're all skin and bones, articulated skeletons, 
polygons, cloud clusters; in resurrection you're all flesh, nothing much 
changes, you're there, you're suppurating, lazarus opposed to julu twine - 
"Let us try to realize the awe-stricken dismay which must have oppressed 
man's mind on the infliction of his first wound, his first experience of 
pain; -- the breach of surface disclosing to his sight his blood flowing 
unceasingly, or leaping, at sustained intervals, from its opened chambers, 
his sense of fainting, and his untimely sinking on the earth under the 
foretaste of death; this, too, with the recent denunciation, 'Thou shalt 
surely die," still ringing in his ears.'" (John Hilton, Rest and Pain.) 
The world splitting fissures the world; the world divided creates an 
episteme. Inscribing difference, that be something oddly enough, of the 
resurrection, so the suturing, what is it? the same again, same body, same 
name, just a little bit older; the fissure operates within-beneath the 
sign of negation, ontologies the same everywhere; one might say at best 
"The residue of the fissure is the fissure." The wound has no bearing on 
resurrection, which occurs anyway. But the wound bares and bears on the 
fissure, is the fissure - the episteme has the addition of a curlicue or 
diacritical mark, a mark already exhausted, bearing nothing, not a hard 
mark to bare or bear. It might as well disappear into the slough, it 
disappears there, just like that. Not even a spark; it would let you know 
if there were a spark, and a char. Nothing like that, nothing like that at 
all, nothing at all. */sound and image bring the sight/site/citation in,

http://www.alansondheim.org/swaner21.jpg

found near Park City, UT, maybe a mayfly but without the cerci and other 
identifying features. obviously not a damselfly or dragonfly or alderfly 
or stonefly. I think it was close to dying, probably already mated. there 
were swallows and swifts around. this is the only one of these I've seen.
