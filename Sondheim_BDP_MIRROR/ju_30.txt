Like a Virgin


My machine is currently accessed by an outsider, an unknown user entering
the /home/httpd/html directory, currently holding a suite of Jennifer
pages I completed a few months ago. 

I saw the lights flashing on the modem, heard the hard-drive in the pro-
cess of being read. 

These files, open to the public, create an uncanny and nervous state in
me, as if I myself am opened to you; the machine seems suddenly vulner-
able, unnerved, a state of _frisson,_ semi-tumescence.

A welcome sign is offered to the reader who nonetheless remains anonymous
in a manner similar to a man lurking in a doorway or an intruder on a dark
and windy night.

For some of you, this input and output is commonplace; for me, this is
close to first. I have used the talker software I installed, with several
people, but I have known all of them; this accessing of the html directory
is different.

I sit here _exposed._

( ls -lu gives file descriptions, including the last time it was accessed.
The group below was entered on my machine around 2:03 this morning. )
