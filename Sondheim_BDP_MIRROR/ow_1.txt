A moment when I think I might just be able to transform anguish into
philosophy. Of course that isn't true; one stays against the stays
of the other, as if moving solo across phenomenological waters. I
can't work this way. Is  make -k C:\dor.el

Give The Female Pope a Rope


Too often have the forces gone astray
That force one's hand; and yet another day
Brings nothing new. Everything is lost
In this or other groping holocaust.
I write the only way I know how to;
Thus write reversed in letters as a Jew
Who claims his right to silent speech,
Lest some good offal - whom I won't beseech -
States, nothing is the same between us two;
You shouldn't speak unless you're spoken to.
I raise my Vajra, Siva's darkling spell
Holds me in thrall; I'll take you all to hell
And back, and forth, and all across the town
Of knaves and fools who want to hold me down.
My writing blisters, cuts the flesh, and seeps
Like acid on the eyes; the reader weeps -
She sees naught, hears what? I cannot guess -
Smells naught, breathes, and touches even less.
I claim the right to both the West and East
As Occident or Orient, I trample; I'm the beast
Of World Wars Three and Four, not to mention Five;
I flay men, women, children, skin theorists alive.
To hell with them who take words as the hammer
Meant for cruelty, for I'm a culture jammer:
And just as you speak from your flesh and blood
I speak your bones and body born of mud.
I take your words, and turn them inside-out
Until they scream forgiveness from your ugly mouth
That squeals traitor, revelation's sin -
You can't know what a State you've put me in.
I'll name it: State of Exculpation, Fear -
The State of Fabrication - I am the seer
Who speaks with bloody mouth, speaks to one and all -
Who leans with bloody back against the bloody wall
Where traitors die, where theory sickens, stains
While I remember boxcars, people, trains.
While I remember Beirut, Iraq, Iran,
Theory steps, confers, and to a man
Or woman sets up condemnation
In no uncertain terms! It tells the nation
Hold back, desist, go home, now end the war!
Books appear, and seminars, and more!
And manifestos filled with deconstruction,
Petitions, mandates, anything that sucks on
The use, employment, of illicit power -
For theory triumphs! This is theory's hour!
I'm on my side and I can only urge
I'm recognized as enemy or sourge -
It's all there, attested-to, I'm sure
Celia shits on me, my writing's but manure
Without the Jewels men wear; please don't sift -
There's nothing down there, just ask Doctor Swift.

Text for Geneve performance this Freitag


Dance. How can I make this entertaining? We shall witness
men and women amputated at the brain! They cannot think!
They can only dance! Dansez Dansez! Oui, c'est tout! Pourquoi?
They are ne real pas, ils dansez le "reel." I make a map of this
dance. Je fabrique un plan von der Unterwelt. They have no legs.
They have no arms. Quel dommage! Pourqoi? POURQUOI? 
Parceque ce'st mois! La Divine! Ceas vrai! Wirklich! I will make
their interieures! Inside them! You will see!

Dance, alas, how can I ever make sense? Together we shall see
human beings with brains and minds cut out! They can't think!
They never could! All they can do is dance! Well, really, is 
that all? Why for the Sake of God! They're not real now, are
they? They dance the reel! They dance the jig! I'll make a 
pretty picture of this dance! I'll make a map of the Underworld!
They have no legs! They don't have arms either! They don't have
brains either! They don't have minds either! This is terrible
damage! I am a cheese! Why, WHY? For the love of the Dear Lord!
Because it's me! I made them! I'm the Author of the World! The
Divine! The Divine Sarah Bernhardt! The Jew! It's True! Really!
I will make their interiors! We'll go inside them! You and I,
we'll go inside their bellies! We'll wear the Pubic Hair! You'll
see! Just wait! You'll see!

Bonjour, salaam, shalom, hello! I will kill myself! Why is this
night different from all other nights? Because I am here? These
are my people! My little people! They run around the room! I 
play my harmonica for you. A little aire, a tiny aire, surely
something you have heard before?

Hello, yes, peace be with you, hello! I commit suicide! Humans
must die so that the world survive? On Chanukah I fled. Is
Geneva safe for Jews? They are my people! My avatars! My little
people! They run around everywhere, underfoot. I will play a 
song, a little aire, a jig or rondelay! I'm sure you have heard
everything already. In English we say, "I've heard everything!"
"I've heard enough!"

I send my voice my voix my Sprechstimme my Alpine Chough across
Space and Grid. Grid breaks space. Une grille for viande. Yes, 
it is True. Space breaks on Grid, Space is lost, gone. What 
remains is Grid. I can say une Grille? C'est possible? Oui? Non?
Dienstag. Space Crackles: craqueter. There are sparks, etin- 
celles; the Grid disturbs Volume. VOLUME IS A SICKNESS, maladie.
Of this I am certain. WHAT IS INSIDE, IS OUTSIDE. WHAT IS OUT-
SIDE, IS INSIDE. Empty the balloons! Videz les ballons!

I send my voices across the wires, Schoenberg's voices, the 
sounds of birds in the Alps, across the universe, Descartes,
Cartesian. The universe is meat, it's true. The universe cooks
the universe, watch out! The fire sparkles, crackles! But here:
VOLUME IS A SICKNESS: there are no things but interiors. From
which some light remains, inside, indoors, next to the fire, in
the kitchen. The balloons from the birthday party deflate!
They lose air! Empty the balloons! Long live the balloons!

We breathe, we suffocate; we are numbered: Abu Gharayb, Bergen-
Belsen, Baghdad, Saigon. The others, Les Autres, are always 
numbered. Regardez-moi: not 650000 dead in Baghdad, les mortes,
but 650,000 - you see? The number divides, the number is divided
- the comma, virgule, makes all the differance (vide Derrida).
DO WE NOT BREATHE AS ONE PERSON? ARE WE NOT HUMAN? souffler, 
suffoquer. My little figures... they are not real... alors...

We breath or try to breath; we are robbed of air. Every one is
a number, 1,2,3, towns and prisons, Auschwitz Tibet Beirut, in 
Amerika we have secrets. In Amerika we torture. Amerika is not
my country, slaughter-house Amerika. Torturer. My Amerika is
not real. My Amerika swallows my America. 

It was different back then... our history, our armoire...

My little figures... they are not real... When I make them, I
travel through them. Then... they are flat, flattened... plat,
platitude, pur. dhamman saranam gacchami langue parole langage
baggage bagage. My cornemuse. My avatars speak with a thousand
voices. Mon poupees.

My dying people, my fucking people, they're real and they're 
not real. When they make me, they travel through me. Then, I'm 
blown up like a poupee, a balloon, a corset in disguise. Take
refuge in the truth, in unknown languages, encased in bagpipes.
Yes, Languages in bagpipes! It's true, it's still true! My 
avatars murmur constantly, you can hear them just beneath the
surface, in my heart, my little gasps of air, my little dolls.

- always engorged with something new. They say it's digital here (no, 
it's cold here!). They say you can fall between one letter and another - 
but just try it! (Go ahead, break the screen!) 

Somebody made me color and somebody made me another color.
You've heard this all before, but what? This particular speech? These 
roars, worthy of Lovecraft?

Every voice has a throat. No voice has a throat. Throat = chamber. 
I've heard these screams before shuttled across the u-s-a.

When I hear these, I think of shortwave. And they were just as hard to 
tune in. Antenna tuning = packet/codec tuning.

These travel partcularly fast. When I found myself sleeping our cat had 
grown to enormous size - rising against me, these sounds.


_


INTERFERENCE 
I have no idea how to begin. These pieces are explorations
of dance-movement translated into alien spaces. This is sound bounced 
from New York to Chicago then back to West Virgnia then back to New 
York using Internet 2. Everything is out of sync. Thiis is Foofwa's 
dance troop doing a synchronized exercise from "swimming."
It's difficult to figure how to get into this material for me. For one 
thing the laptop was acting up. We found a toy gun in California and 
scanned it in West Virginia - deconstructing it atthe same time. Ok we 
did this with a tree as well
This will go on until I stop it.
Sometimes you get up in the morning and its not the right thing to say. 
Do you know the United States is at WAR with Iraq!? I found out today - 
that's really bad. They were looking for illegal immigrants and look 
what they came up with - WEAPOONS OF MASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS 
DESTRUCTION~! I knew my United States
             MY UNITED STATES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
would come through in the end. And everybody thought that Bush was a 
two bit terrorist who was anti-gay? Whatever happened to his daughters? 
They're probably fucking Rumseld.
I look on this as therapy. While I'm playiing with software programs 
(the very latest!_ (not really)) - there are a numbetr of species going 
extinct per hour.
But they can all move to the Arcitic. By the way polar bears have 
turned cannibal and elephants are raping other species - this is true - 
as animals find their habitat disappiearing. What these abstract imags 
ar -
the body is divided into 17 segments and these are then captured while 
a dancer moves - the movements are captured - and then - then you can 
map them on to for example people - 
These people practiced for weeks to get it right and I had to pay them 
to get naked.
Now we can take this mapping of figures onto figures - dancers onto 
avatar dancers - and we can map into entirely new spaces and content - 
So this is a dancer transformed.
Well hell this has no use whatsoever but I'm fascinated by the 
extentions of the body - When you play around with software like this 
you can enter the world of dreams so quickly...
I can't find my way outshide this world.

Dance. How can I make this entertaining? We shall witness
men and women amputated at the brain! They cannot think!
They can only dance! Dansez Dansez! O Here is Azure being scanned. The 
laser destroyed one of my cameras. I have learned not to work in the 
real world. ui, c'est tout! Pourquoi?

They are ne real pas, ils dansez le "reel." I make a map of this
dance. Je fabrique un plan von der Unterwelt. They have no  Now in 
order to get away from legs I have moved into the interior of 
avatars... So this is what it looks like from inside -

They have no arms. Quel dommage! Pourqoi? POURQUOI? 
Parceque ce'st mois! La Divine! Ceas vrai! Wirklich! I will make
their interieures! Inside them! You will see!
I forgot the trees. Here is a tree being scanned by a laser sending the 
signal out - From here you can move deep into the dtree .. there are 
other things to see.... You can see the laser burn.
The best way to proceed I think is to hmmm... Is to go into the real 
world as little as possible... and then bring back whatever you need 
like going to a 7-11 or something - Is this going ok Foofwa? Uh it 
seems to lack coherency. I wish I was home making new avatars on my 
computer to fuck with.
Later no earlier
in 2006 I don't know what happened, I showed work - real pieces of 
things and computers - in Los Angels - you can actually stumble over 
wires once you leave home.
One absolutely has to know how to inhabit theoretical digital space. 
Every other space will become poisonous. This space now this space here 
- this space is a ruler being taken apart by a laser - you can study it 
and see how measurement began.
I keep thinking I've got some terrible disease and am just about to die 
(SOB!) so I need your sympathy vote!
This is my partner Azure Azul being deconstructed on a bad hair day. So 
I'm thinking of war and extinctions and the nightmare the world is 
turning into and atomic bombs going off and being unable to sleep and I 
can't help making stupid jokes. Like the maarx brothers - it's a kind 
of immigrant fever -
More mapping of dancers. Foofwa is the only person I know who could 
dance this.
The advantage of a dancer: You'll have your body at the end of the 
world. 
The disadvantage of a dancer: You'll have your body at the end of the 
world.
And you will send signals to yourself.
You will send signals to yourself.
You'll look in the mirror and say hello world.
And nothing will say anything back.
Not even you.
Susan Sontag I think wrote about the tens of thousand of birds that 
died at 9/11.
In New York they erected a memorial of lights. The lights went high in 
the sky and interacted with migrating flocks of birds.
Ten thousand birds died because of the memorial.
So the question is: How do you make art - not after Auschwitz -
but IN Auschwitz? Because we are at the gates and work arbeit does 
nothing for us.

Dance, alas, how can I ever make sense? Together we shall see
human beings with brains and minds cut out! They can't think!
They never could! All they can do is dance! Well, really, is 
that all? Why for the Sake of God! They're not real now, are
they? They dance the reel! They dance the jig! I'll make a 
pretty picture of this dance! I'll make a map of the Underworld!
They have no legs! They don't have arms either! If I could dance - if I 
could really dance - I wouldn't be doing any of this - why bother? You 
have your body on your back and your back on your body and that's all 
you'd need.
When you look at the world correctly, on what basis can you do anything 
at all?
Hello I am the world. I don't have anything at al. They don't have
brains either! They don't have minds either! This is terrible
damage! I am a cheese! Why, WHY? For the love of the Dear Lord!
Because it's me! I made them! I'm the Author of the World! The
Divine! The Divine Sarah Bernhardt! The Jew! It's True! Really!
I will make their interiors! We'll go inside them! You and I,
we'll go inside their bellies! We'll wear the Pubic Hair! You'll
see! Just wait! You'll see!

Bonjour, salaam, shalom, hello! I will kill myself! Why is this
night different from all other nights? Because I am here? These
are my people! My little people! They run around the room! I 
play my harmonica for you. A little aire, a tiny aire, surely
something you have heard before?
Because we can bounce sound around the world like this.
But we can't stop trade in rhino horns.
Azure struggles with the avatar. The avatar has to avoid the swords. 
The swords make the avatar angry. Azure writhes in pain. If she moves 
she will be cut by the swords.The swords are dream sword.s They do not 
exist in reality. In reality I am home at the moment comfortably seated 
in front of my computer. And Im working on new exciting software 
programs called
RHINO
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION
ABU GHARAYB (fun to play!)
Guantanamo 
Afghanistan
North Korea
Pakistan
United States
China
This is how I imagine EMPIRE - something in the form of a dream. And if 
EMPIRE stays a dream then everything
then everything will be 
then everything will be okay.
Then everything will be okay.

Thank you.

pas d'une


In the distant future, a dancer will be seen, at the edge of the space 
of dance, immersed in her world, 
Ah shall this dancer be nameless, shall skull-bones, dust-bones tell 
any story other than that of a misidentified corpse,
Shall grace still be among them, graciousness, will this remnant speak,
of a world in which some were still peaceful, unwilling to slaughter, 
unwilling to be slaughtered,
For the youth of a dancer is lost, before the dancer's youth, and the 
dancer's body is lost, before the body of the dancer,
And that so early and lone among the furious travesties of a wounded 
world, 
And the cause, and the choreography, and the choreographer, all lost,
And the circle of friends, gone, gone, even the idea of friendship,
And names and places and languages, all, gone and all gone,
This trace of the dancer remains, against the wall of plague and 
pestilence, against the wall of radiation, wall of heat and inundation, 
wall of fire and thirst, wall of starvation,
"no one to see the trace, no one to remember, nothing to remember, no 
memory at all,"
No dancer walking now among us, dancing in the corner of a stage in 
Geneva, immersed in the world of dance, immersed in the dancing world.

European Indians I will see you on the other side of the world.
It's all in the overtones.
To my right: a book about two hands.
Climb up from Egga with 1887 guide and horseback or walk.
Perhaps walk from Blatten or Brig, around 4 1/2 - 5 hours.
We walk from Egga. At the top: Alpine Chough. 
In my estimation animals sense transformations of EMF.
Look around the edge of the universe - there's the slightest bit.
There, la.
Really one might fall forever seven hundred meters to the base.
The largest glacier in the Alps, Aletsch has retreated 3 km since 1865.
Earlier, glacial levels were close to the lower peaks.
It is not the fault of the glaciers that will inundate our cities.
Their skin dries, hardens; attacked by plants and animals, they
continue their retreat.
Foofwa talks to universal sound.
O! Unmeasured howling of the mountains!

Philosophy and Others of Dance, numerous pieces, feedback welcomed


Prolog:

Maud-enunciation of avatars, pre-duet: the occupation of virtual space - 
sad pirouette sad dancer lonely dancer left behind magic wand paper stars 
in paper skies tiny bows and pas http://www.asondheim.org/maudatar.mp4 
d'une d'une, I will hide your tiny little URL, almost so real - When the 
Role disappears from dance, dance is.

When the dancer disappears, when position and momentum disappear, when 
energy and space disappear, when many and one disappear; when eidetic 
reduction and the phenomenological stance are flattened, historicized, 
demarcated, incapable of reproduction, incapable of recuperation; the 
accumulation of the symbolic, dance is disappearance, no longer imminent, 
immanent: then paste, defuge, tumescent shuddering of the real. Then 
nothing of the real. Then "annihilation to the limit" which is nothing. 
Which is nothing at all.

Paragraphs and Chapters:

Below: "dance is" - dance philosophy, not philosophy of dance. Short 
analysis and explanation of the dance series in relation to the 
virtual/real, analog/digital, and governance/community. There are five 
dance-is to date: Foofwa*2, Alan, Maud, Tom where it all started. 
http://www.asondheim.org/alandanceis.mp3

I always wonder about dance, participating in choreography or mise-en- 
scene, or compositeur, even a bit of movement; I can't dance, am awkward 
and far too nervous; I admire dancers but there are very few I relate to. 
Foofwa's work is close to performance, sport, theory. But it's a question 
of the Sign - which is always already mute; in writing, sign is signifying 
- assignation. Dance reads, constructs, deconstructs the world; this is 
also a characteristic of culture in general. Dance begins and ends with 
the consciousness of the body; why wear clothes? Use props? Why work for 
that matter within the institution of the theater? Writing and the gospel 
truth - http://www.asondheim.org/mercigrotto.mp4

There is the gospel of dance, its history, which is something else, as in 
photography or any other cultural form in these thick times - it's over- 
determined, obstructive, overly cognizant of cultural form, of modes of 
distribution, of theatrical and terpsichorean politics, of master-disciple 
relationships, of the aporia of the knotted student.

There's the gospel of the virtual, its imaginary, elsewhere, as in the 
shamanic or production of images in these exfoliated times - it's overtly 
misrecognized, smoothed, the incipient production of culture, telecommun- 
ications, any moment of being, of absenting relationship, but of techno- 
logical construct as well. And of the real, of which the less or more said 
the better or the worse. http://www.asondheim.org/virtualreal.mp4

[[ sed 's/writing/real/g' < The real dances around dance; writing dances 
around the real; the real dances around writing; etc. sed 's/dance/X/g' 
The real Xs around X; writing Xs around the real; the real Xs around 
writing; etc. < analog < digital < etc. > sed 's/real/written/g' etc. | 
sed 's/real/"real"/g' | sed 's/real/X/g' -> "X" < digital == analog > 
faunal cultural history < inscription < digital ]]

[[ X* ]] perhaps another term than dance, for how should definition 
function here? Or perhaps neither performance nor the body. One is left 
with abjection, the sublime, real/imaginary; let us call this the "abject 
sublime." For we are within this era, this positioning, dulled, imploded, 
decathetcted, exhausted, condition of defuge. If defuge relates to 
depression, then defuge relates to the real in a manner of none other, 
nothing else. And if we do not think dance, we do not think culture, we 
begin to think.

similar to the avatar but the dancer is dancer imitated by a month old,
protocol-driven, hunger for signifiers, azure struggles which is more

avatar-abuse: this relates to mother-father relations: primordial thought
of "my avatars avatars." so this is what it looks like from inside - an
avatar. those few knew i played with avatars; all of them are avatars,
but mapped - which in fact indicates the direct murmuring of avatar-meat;
you can hear them directly beneath the swords. avatars have to avoid
swords, their baggage. they speak through a thousand dancers, most of whom
were abused.

the devils in Rilke's church

http://www.asondheim.org/rilkes.mov very short

emanations tether flesh to representation
imaginary spreads the paste of the body's uncertain declination
"i decline to accept such images"
"i recline to accept such images"
nothing moves but the trembling of your drum of flesh
we were never stopped, nothing stopped us, not even hell
the hell of burning cocks, burning cunts
but never this ecstasy or indefinite sublime which remains unreachable
o holderlin
o rilke
the shadows of prophecy turn one inside out
shuddering, primitive he said, shuddering she said, trembling
surmounting the drum of flesh, unmounting the drum of flesh
pipe and tabor played simultaneously with hands and mouths
racket played with fingers and mouths
viol d'amore, vial d'amore, vile the mouths of hell
ecstatic the mouths of hell
o rilke
o holderlin
the mouths of hell return us to the remnants of perfect desire



deploy, he said, the devouring powers of light


all natural languages have precisely the same degree of complexity.
'destroy, she said', 'primitive, he said', 'enjoy, he said', 'deploy,
she said.'
to deconstruct is neither to analyze nor to take apart.
http://www.asondheim.org/eatenbylight.mp4
you can't argue with an aphorism.
'code' is more than structure, structure is more than substructure,
substructure is more than equivalence, organism is less than code.
throw out everything you know about animal behavior and culture;
humans are just beginning to discover civilization.
our knowledge is not our own.
humans construct the only deliberate, calculated, and universal
slaughter-house.
everything an enemy, every enemy a thing.
take the man from the woman and kill him.
binary oppositions replace cultural capital with economic capital.
there are dozens of types of war and at any time we are engaged
in at least a quarter of them.
do not ask for whom the bell tolls; ask who made the bell.
an aphorism makes the man.
reality is imaginary's monotonic.
or the romanticism of the real is the classicism of the imaginary.
projection kills and introjection devours.
or introjection suppurates and projection wounds.
murder is wild war.
if i want a word with you, the word i want is 'you.'
give away your sex and there goes your reputation.
give away your reputation and here comes your sex.
public masturbation constructs the truth of the real for audience and
masturbater alike.
faunal extinction takes humans home.
sex kills and slaughter entertains.
eroticism is the neocon of sexual war.
the aphoristic is the final refuge of the defeated.
aphorisms are always otherwise.

devouring waters of li(f)(gh)t

colonized by light
light = colonization of invisible matter
invisible matter = universal organism
organism = colonialization
colony = territorialization
release the light! deterritorialize!

http://www.asondheim.org/eatenbylight.mp4

dancer: Filibert Tologo
stage: la Salle des Eaux-Vives, Geneve

throw out everything we know about the future of the human race:
there isn't any, anything recognizable.
throw out everything we know about animal behaviour and culture:
we're blind and will remain so, driving species to extinction.

these are the truths brought to us by dance and culture:
dance and culture brings Signs from Worlds eaten by light.
dance and culture have no territory:
Worlds disappear, tethered to exhausted Signs.

*/
At first I thought this period is the end of prehistory, that history only
begins with the definitive event of the large-scale disappearance of hu-
mans across an earth ruined by nuclear, chemical, and biological warfare.
The future of history is hyperhistory; all other histories meander through
fractured sememes destined to disappear.

Then I thought this period is the beginning of prehistory, towards the
potential of the mute, the moot point, the unacknowledged pivot or hinge,
the elimination of all evidence of the pivot, which after all is spread
across space and time, reaching far behind us for example, extending far
ahead of us for example. This prehistory may be followed by nothing in
terms of familiar inscription; it may be followed by a superfluity of
familiar inscription; it may be all or nothing, open or closed.

But whether or not this is the end or beginning of prehistory, it is the
continuation of the brute, inert, violence of our existence, scabbing and
devouring beyond the carrying-capacity of the earth - it is the continua-
tion or the end of our existence, the violence itself carrying-on, residue
far beyond lifespans, half-lifespans, sintering of the remnants of debris.

throw out, throw out, throw out





three videos, the most beautiful, the sublime, the compelling


below: perhaps an unintended homage to gustave moreau, certainly my most 
beautiful work, which comes through, however strangely, in spite of the 
necessary compression. taped inside the rilke church, if i may call it 
that, in raron, accompanied with the falls at the very tip of the aletsch. 
here is spirit at its most sublime, from the upward sweep of the nave, to 
the grandiosity of the glacier itself, many thousands of feet below.

http://www.asondheim.org/rilketongue.mp4

below: closeup of the 'tongue' of the aletsch glacier, with modified very 
low frequency radio signals taken from the same site. the signals were 
contaminated, by local power generation, up there on the bluff. filtering 
was difficult because the generators seemed somewhat unstable. i used 
extreme hiss reduction, notch filtering, and graphic equalization to 
create something 'readable.' i'm fascinated that the glacier moves of 
course at a snail's pace or slower - but accompanied these radio signals, 
which originate from mostly from cosmic and atmospheric phenomena. radio 
emissions (from cosmic and atmomspheric phenomena) - invisible events, 
interpreted as sound. again, the sublime, which often appears without the 
body of this body of work.

http://www.asondheim.org/aletschvlf.mp4

below: foofwa on 'dance is' for a second take in a squat in geneva. this 
is more personal than the first 'dance is' and as such it was taped in a 
more or less straightforward manner. i find the take quite touching. we 
later talked about the graffiti surrounding us; the tags were in english, 
and seemed to represent a form of the usual colonization.

or some of them might split as well, no limits to splits
azure takes it in stride, she doesn't break stride,
she walks astride, quasar among black holes, she needs
at least ten dimensions to express the life of the castle
or the wall's life or the midnight lights,
she's cracker-jack tensor, her eigenvalues stay close,
determine her trajectory within the eleven parameters

as science determines lit crit, lit crit determines science,
all poetics embody science, science is subset of poetics
humans lead the way from eleven dimensions, 
back to them, string theory makes the poem

Sonnet 

One quarter of my life remains to me.
One fifth, one sixth, one seventh.
The thickness of the world = deathbed spirituality.
Call ontology what you will = thick mantle of flesh.
Barrel of flesh = warmth in winter, food in drought.
More and more I recognize _I inhabit myself._
The body = burial shroud.
No other is needed = the other is always needed.
I turn around and recognize world other than my mother.
The mind stumbles to comprehend radical difference.
Radical difference = strangulation of the mesh.
One eighth of my life remains to me.
Listen! These are the worlds of an _already-ghost._
Flesh and bone = beautiful nudity. 
"We are all holes under the hammer of god."

Does this work?

I'm fairly complicated in this regard; part of me feels that I'm genius 
and working on necessary (however defined) themes, part of me is jealous 
and troubled that others haven't really read the material (one thing that 
happens a lot is that people feel a kind of hatred or awe at the work that 
also keeps them from it), and part of me feels just worthless in any 
situation - which has nothing to do with any of my work per se, but goes 
back as usual to family issues/problems.

http://www.asondheim.org/bones.mov (with Sandy Baldwin)

There's always an issue of legitimation and history. Because my work is 
produced in sections and over a wide variety of outlets, but not intensely 
within any particular outlet, I feel I have to literally re-present the 
grounds I work within, in any given publication. This has led to a fairly 
dense writing, which is also fragmentary. I've taught in so many venues 
without any kind of stability, that the fragment seems almost second 
nature to me, more than the finished text which involves, again, a kind of 
stability I've never had.

http://www.asondheim.org/dns.mov (with Sandy Baldwin)

As far as contents are concerned - I think what I do is valuable - at 
least the work I do with analog/digital, defuge, virtual/real, the older 
material on rewrite, immersive/definable, thresholding, and so forth. The 
theorization of sexuality, body, and language, tends to be overdetermined 
but these are grounds - abjection, the corpse, arousal, familiality - that 
we live within and through, and they're often not confronted directly. 
Sexuality sloughs into eroticism, body into body of theory or theoretical 
body, and so forth. It's one thing to have theoretical layers between 
abject and reader; it's another to have them rub raw against one another.

I felt this at the conference panel today in fact - that we're talking 
about Web 3.0 on a dying planet; most people have little, if any, access 
to broadband, yet the discussion appeared as if within the 'pure' of 
capital, infinite capital, a fecund planet, and so forth. It's short- 
sighted. For me, the death of _any_ species as a result of human behavior 
is both problematic and dire - and yet we're destroying at a steady rate 
of 3/4 an _hour._ It's all too easy to read WOW against that, but theory, 
at least on the panel, presented the site of gaming as independent or 
immune or oblivious. Again, I think that extinction/pain/slaughter and 
virtual pain/slaughter inhere within each other. -

In my secret dreams, I want to produce, work on, processes etc. that are 
new, that move in entirely new directions, at least for me, and at least 
as far as possible. And while the work might embrace sexuality, it ab- 
jures violence; there isn't murder or beatings or rapine in Incidences or 
the videos - in fact there are pleasures, sadnesses, fear of death, and so 
forth, but no celebration of brute force. I can't abide it; my early 
reading of the Nuremberg medical trials still gives me nightmares, and I 
have no faith in humans; they/we are capable of absolutely anything. So I 
try to make my ecological footprint as small as possible in this regard 
(which touches on vegan concerns, and so forth).

I've never seen re/presentations of humans in the manner I work with them 
(yes, it's easy to mess up in Poser and produce distorted figures, but 
they're not married to motion capture, they don't return to the flesh 
etc.), nor have I seen dance/performance in the manner of Foofwa and co. 
In the music/soundwork I try to go elsewhere than anything I hear. It's a 
kind of migratory/emigrant behavior, a forced nomadicism (at least in the 
roots); again I'd have to retreat to family history. (I should say I 
identify with Lenny Bruce, Houdini, the Marx bros. here.)

http://www.asondheim.org/azuredanceis.mp4

I want to take theory, however I understand it, to the limit, to the limit 
among other things, of its annihilation; theory is as destructive as it is 
revelation - it distances the always-already distanced, to the point of 
language games, no return, conferencing, capital, enunciation. 

I love Lingis in this regard, and Existence and Existents as well. If one 
can be made uncomfortable in a positive way, one succeeds; there's some 
sort of progress (although I don't believe in progress per se). It would 
be even better if one might be motivated to the point of political respon- 
sibility, but I think at least in this world, that's asking too much...

So back to the beginning of this meander, I think what I'm doing is 
valuable, and I have absolutely no doubt about that, none at all. How it 
plays out within and without acad- emia - I have no idea, but for me (in a 
safe position of course), that's not the primary thing. The primary thing 
is the work - for me, it's always been the work, above anything else. I'm 
well aware that this is a neurotic position but it keeps me going. -

Pillars and Dance

CountryDance was videotaped on a bluff overlooking Lac Leman in the Roman 
city of Nyon, outside of Geneve. Maud Liardon performs a folk or country 
dance which, I believe, is Swedish in origin; Foofwa d'Imobilite performs 
a separated but inseparable work, separated by the framing device of a 
pillar. (The scene is a remnant of a ruin, agora or forum transported to 
its present location above the void.) If Maud's dance resonates with the 
names of towns encountered on our journey, Foofwa's speeds and slows, 
measured against them. It is the regulatory apparatus of Roman architec- 
ture and military organization against the peasantry, with its excessive 
retemporalization of the real. Jakarta and shadow puppetry come to mind as 
d'Imobilite's presentation appears flattened in its silhouette; the pirou- 
etting of Liardon transforms the female body into volume - a volumetric 
whose forensics reveal the architecture of fecundity. Her turns create a 
tensor calculus destined to overturn the fabric of Roman linearity.

Beyond this evident symbolics, there are issues of nationalism, Swiss 
nationalism and its symbolic - Switzerland, with its 100,000 year-old 
past, ranging from deep prehistory through the wild tribal groups 
surrounding Hannibal's pilgrimage through the Alps. One has the Alphorn, 
citharas of all sorts, yodels and cheese, skies and private banking; one 
has costuming and multiple languages and dialects, Swatch and army knife, 
Rolex and fondue. The symbols proliferate to the extent that the imaginary 
of the Alps occupies a territory almost as large as the United States; in 
reality, Switzerland is roughly the size of West Virginia. Given this, any 
sign of "authenticity" may be seized by the visitor as Switzerland's 
Beyond, in the heart of the country and its culture. The fractal Alps 
twist and turn all the way down; dancing might present the preposterous 
notion of a "Swiss soul" (or any other nation's "soul") as the flesh 
supports Foofwa's "authentic" (the quotes proliferate) Gruyere costume.

Nevertheless the emblematic espoused by d'Imobilite's dance is a furious 
series of signs, almost toppling against the steadied rhythm of Maud's 
performance. Consider this: an alphabet of dance transformed through the 
graphemic directly into inscription, which is sublimated into the usual 
form and figuration of text. To the extent that dance leaves one speech-
less, dance speaks; isn't this true of any cultural form? And if it is so, 
if it is true, than cultural form subsumes speech, creates a differend out 
of which speech emerges only in its problematic. Here, speech is simultan- 
eously performative and non-performative - and what is the performative of 
speech in the first place? Nothing whatsoever without cultural context, 
mores, etiquette, and power down the road. This isn't the performative of 
a computer program in which for example "date" produces "October 4" - it's 
not process but flattening, re/presentation. Dance gives the lie, in other 
words, to the performative of language, just as violence gives the lie to 
dance. It is both degree and epistemological shift; ontology is just 
around the corner. 

This conundrum, this relative annihilation of language, fascinates dance, 
fastens dance. Language is ultimately residue; inscription is hardened 
language, the beginnings of power, the suturing of the body politic. It 
takes dance, and dance signifying class, to unite language through its 
bypassing. Revolution is in the step, and violence is not far behind. One 
way or another, the earth stumbles beneath the feet of the dancers; one 
way or another, everything and nothing survives.

Dead


I woke up this morning covered in blood. I fell down the stairs and a 
sharp shard of bone cut into my abdomen. A severe stroke has incapacitated 
my right side. Alzheimer's lesions have almost literally cauterized my 
memory; I hardly recognize Azure. The odd pulsing in my abdomen stems from 
a hard lump which appears to be growing. When I try to stand my legs 
collapse under me. My stools are bloody. I've been so dizzy I can hardly 
walk across the room. I'm constantly sweating under the bed-clothes. I 
tried to call Azure but could hardly speak. I fell on the floor and lost 
consciousness and died. The whole bathroom is covered with blood. There 
are spots in front of my eyes everywhere. I can't see anymore. Help me up. 
My arms are tingling. My brain is swelling; the pain is horrible. My heart 
is beating so fast it's bursting. I can't breath. I'm gasping for breath. 
I'm about to go unconscious. I'm too dizzy to stand up. My heart's stopped 
beating. It's permanent. I'm dead. There's an unbelievable pain in my 
lower abdomen. My stomach's in knots. I'm falling over. I'm crawling to 
the door. I die before I reach the door. There's a white light but the 
light fades. The pain is too great. I can't think about anything. I call 
Azure's name. I think I called it. I can't remember about anything. I 
can't stand up. I can't be here. My chest is torn in two. I can't see 
anything. My ears filled with screams. The screams may be mine. I don't 
want to die. I really don't want to die. The right side of my body is 
gone. I'm bleeding from my mouth. I can't move. I'm dead.

transgression of the 1st and 2nd life

the chiasm turns back on itself. 
I knew something was wrong with the world.
at the edge, the pli or fold - analog transforms into zero.
zero-multiplication: the world is absorbed.
one-multiplication: the world returns to the world.
we do not return. 
we head across the divide.
we are returned.
again and again, we are returned.
we form a corpuscle.

if zero is boundary, one is interior.
the boundary has zero area in relation to interior.
but the same order of the continuum.

you can assign addresses one place or another.
these addresses are on the boundary.
the interior is emptied.
the interior is empty.

because it's useless to move in such and such a direction,
i move in such and such a direction.
because nothing lives or dies there, i give myself
the permission of breath.

I announce to you: the cleansing of the waters of forgetfulness.

That way of the waters of forgetfulness there are things.

Reviews of Numerous Wonderful Books

I haven't done these in a while; I'm fairly behind schedule. But there are 
so many exciting things, new and used, that I feel the need to begin, even 
if the reviews are encapsulated.

1 Prevention of Railroad Accidents or Safety in Railroading, George 
Bradshaw, 1912. This is a small semi-paperback, profusely illustrated. 
There are sections on how to move explosives and warnings about not 
climbing on the front of a locomotive while it's moving towards you. 
"Don't try to open knuckles as cars are about to come together." This 
curious work opens a whole new world of course. Look for it!

2 The Book of Talismans, Amulets, and Zodaical Gems, Thomas and Pavitt, 
1914. This is a wonder; there are ten plates plus one colored plate, 
covering gnosticism, Egypt, India, the Koran, and so forth. A lengthly 
section deals with the mystic qualities of gems. I believe this has been 
reprinted..

3 The Ochre Robe, an autobiography, Agehananda Bharati. This is a troub- 
ling book by an Austrian who wrote the brilliant The Tantric Tradition. 
Bharati was somewhat of a follower of Bose; his account is oddly harsh, 
"no-nonsense," and thereby wonderful. Bharati was an expert, among other 
things, on Wittgenstein and the British philosophical tradition; his use 
of language is precise. I can recommend both of these books without hes- 
itation; The Tantric Tradition for example has an important section on 
intentional language. (1970-80)

4 Selected Writings, Walter Benjamin, edited by Jennings, Eiland, and 
Smith, Harvard, 2005 paperback, five volumes from the original hardcover 
four. All I can say is Wow! These are absolutely amazing. I've been 
working on a theory of "defuge" - the roots are here. There's enough to 
keep cyberspatial theorists busy for years. The entries range from frag- 
ment to extended essay, and there are probably a couple of hundred of 
them. This, along with the full Arcades, has to be one of the monumental 
philosophical/literary works of our time.

5 HTML & XHTML, The Definitive Guide, 6th edition, Musciano and Kennedy, 
O'Reilly, 2007. I love this book (I received a review copy); I've used the 
previous editions as well. It is intelligent, packed with information, 
clear, and prescriptive; I can't recommend a better book for Web authors. 
Everything from CSS and XML through URLs is clarified. Even if you only 
use GUI editing software for Webpages, this gives you useful information 
on what goes on "under the hood" - information that allows you to tweak 
pages any way you want. There's a useful webpage for the book as well. The 
book is also "Safari Enabled" - which allows you to access it entirely on 
the Web for a fee. I used Safari for a while but realized I prefer my 
books next to me; not everything has to be on the screen, not even texts 
about online organization.

6 Death Scenes, A Homicide Detective's Scrapbook, Katherine Dunn, text; 
edited by Sean Tejaratchi, Feral, 1996. I hadn't seen this before; it's 
hard to look at. Bodies are blown apart, dismembered, hung, torn apart, 
shot, knifed, and so forth. The detective is Jack Huddleston, who worked 
in LA from the 20s to the 50s. Dunn's essay frames the material. The book 
exposes one beyond CSI coolness; it's difficult to view without becoming 
involved; instead of desensitization, one becomes aware, to a very raw 
degree, of humanity's propensity towards violence and annihilation. 
There's no way to "bypass" the images. I'd recommend this to everyone, 
although one might have nightmares for days after.

7 Pancoast's Tokology and Ladies' Medical Guide, A Complete Instructor in 
all the Delicate and Wonderful Matters Pertaining to Women, 1901-03, with 
"many illustrations," by S. Pancoast M. D., enlarged and revised by Wesley 
Cook. There's a description of plates - and the plates aren't there. There 
are other plates that aren't listed. The text sometimes leaves the page 
altogether due to printing errors, and the result is something like John 
Furnival's concrete poetry. The text is also wonderful; testes, but not 
the penis, are described; there are images of anomalies of the vagina, but 
none of the "normal" vagina; images of deformed and joined babies 
accompany the section on ("normal") childbirth, and the authors on one 
hand applaud the emancipation of women and on the other decry suffrage. 
What comes through with all of this is the incredible frailty of child- 
birth at the time - so much could and did go wrong, as well as a medical 
habitus that can report cases from 1650 or so as if they were relevant and 
accurate in the early 20th-century. The book in other words is a pastiche 
of anecdote and "strict" medical knowledge; it's troubling on all levels.

8 Anomalies and Curiosities of Medicine, reprinted numerous times from 
1896, by George Gould and Walter Pyle. My edition is two volumes from 
1937. This work, composed largely of anecdotes, many of which are 
illustrated, is a guide to the monstrous; the images are in extremism. The 
result is a semiotics of the plasticity of the human form; the stories 
read something like Stekel or Ellis in tone. I think of this as an antique 
cabinet of wonders, of course. One of the directions emphasized by many of 
the older books above is the relative lack of structural principles; rumor 
and exaggeration from the Greeks onward characterize a kind of fascinating 
pseudo-science; the greater or more exaggerated the transformation, the 
more it holds our interest.

9 The Baburnama, Memoirs of Babur, Prince and Emperor, Thackston, 2002. 
The emperor Babur, 1483-1530, wrote this personal chronicle of ethnog- 
raphy, poetics, brutality and war. As the back cover says, this is "the 
first autobiography in Islamic literature". The text is wonder to read out 
of order; I found myself uninterested in the historical aspects, but very 
interested in the description, for example, of Kabul. The introduction is 
by Rushdie. I highly recommend this; it's like nothing I've ever read 
before.

10 The History of Humayun, Humayun-Nama by Gul-Baden Begam, translated by 
Beveridge, first published 1902. Gul-Baden Begam is Babur's daughter; this 
account reveals a great deal about a mystic palace, weddings, court life, 
and battles, from the viewpoint of an Islamic woman. I personally found 
this the more interesting of the texts, but very different; the two should 
be read together.

11 The Art of the Byzantine Empire, 312-1453, edited Cyril Mango, Toronto, 
1986. Wonderful accounts of the building of St Sophia among other things. 
I knew nothing about these texts, which are arranged thematically and 
chronologically; there's a mystical account of the construction which is 
quite beautiful. The book is texts only; there are no illustrations.

12 Ancient China's Technology and Science, "Compiled by the Institute of 
the History of Natural Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences," Beijing, 
1983. The sections on mathematics, the south-pointing chariot and odometer 
are of great interest. There is a description of the abacus as well as 
counting- or mathematical- sticks, which, for me, is quite important; I 
wonder if the sticks are related to the Mah Jong counting sticks. In any 
case, the sticks are used in quite a different manner than the usual; the 
positions determine to some extent their orientation, and the numerical 
value is calculated by horizontals and verticals. There's more than a bit 
of the old Maoist propaganda here, but the book is invaluable as a 
resource.

13 Emotions and Relations, Nan Goldin, David Armstrong, Mark Morrisroe, 
Jack Pierson, and Philip-Lorca diCorcia, curated F.C. Gundlach, Taschen, 
1987. These photographs are friends and worked with and through one 
another at times. The images are stark, disturbing, discomfiting no matter 
how you try to frame them. In a different way, they remind me of the work 
of Araki, who is also a disturbance, Larry Clark, others. When an image 
abandons the punctum for a field incapable of recuperation, something 
works on the subject in a radically different way. These aren't death 
scenes but life scenes that simultaneously refuse, slide easily. I do 
recommend the work of these photographers, Araki as well, creepy though he 
may be.

14 A New Course in Reading Pali, Entering the Word of the Buddha, James W. 
Gair and W.s. Karunatillake, Motilal, 1998-2005, and Introduction to Pali, 
2nd edition, A.K. Warder, Pali Text Society, 1984. Thanks to Gabe Gudding 
for the first of these, which contains, right from the beginning, texts 
from the Canon. The Pali Canon is a large and complex collection of works 
that stem from the time of the Buddha; they're the heart of the Theraveda. 
Pali is the language of the Buddha as well; the texts that survive are 
spiritual. Pali has no endemic, specific alphabet; there are a number in 
use, including the Roman. The second book contains a more detailed grammar 
as well as an extended Pali-English, English-Pali dictionary. Both are 
beautiful; I never will learn Pali (I have no patience for anything, 
including myself, at my age), but I begin to understand the grammar, the 
"flow" of the language, which is tremendously exciting. I'd recommend the 
first of these books primarily, but the second is necessary (I think) as 
well.

15 Assyrian Language, Easy Lessons in the Cuneiform Inscriptions, L.W. 
King, Routledge, 1901, reprinted by AMS. Cuneiform is impossibly diffi- 
cult; I find that this book, although antiquated and quite possibly 
incorrect, gives a good introduction to the syllabic aspects of the 
script. It's a way in. Assyrian is related of course to Babylonian, 
Akkadian, Hebrew, Arabic; it's semitic (and therefore fun!). This book has 
proved far more useful than I thought it would. The book goes well with 
Beginner's Assyrian, D.G. Lyon, reprinted by Hippocrene.

16. Fijian Grammar, G.B. Milner, Government Press, Fiji, 1972. I'm 
fascinated by Hawaiian, Tahitian, Fijian. This is a somewhat complete 
grammar; the author immediately departs from western categorizations, 
using instead bases, common, particles, voice, etc. The bases and 
particles are of particular interest, since they seem to point the way 
towards another non-Indo-European semantics of great interest. This is one 
of the most interesting language texts I've seen.

17 A Cultural History of Tibet, David Snellgrove and Hugh Richardson, 
Shambhala, 1968. As with almost all the other books mentioned here, I have 
no idea whether or not this is considered "accurate" by today's standards. 
I wish I had known about this book earlier; it clarifies the country (at 
least for me), provides somewhat of a foundation for thinking through all 
those texts and practices in translation. There it is, at the beginning 
and end of my library. Recommended as essential.

18 Nonduality, A Study in Comparative Philosophy, David Loy, 1988. Yes, 
this is also recommended, also provides a path of thinking; western 
references include Derrida; Buddhism, Vedanta, the Bhagavad-Gita, etc. are 
covered in detail. I found the work illuminating; nonduality is opened and 
released.

19 Field Theory in Social Science, Selected Theoretical Papers, Kurt 
Lewin, Harpers, 1951. Mix with Lacan; Lewin developed a topological field 
theory of personal and psychological processes; there are numerous 
examples (with, I believe, dubious mathematical formulas) throughout. One 
can go from here to Lacan to Sokal (who I think should be given a bit more 
credence than he is). On the other hand, the topological tools and notion 
of a field are quite useful; dynamic group processes, for example, are 
analyzed in detail.

20 Revolt, She Said, Julia Kristeva, Semiotext(e) Foreign Agents Series. 
Semiotext(e) is the Museum of Modern Art for theorists; it's simultan- 
eously hip and canonical; the Semiotext(e) seal of approval extends far 
beyond the size of the paperbacks. Be that as it may, Baudrilliard aside, 
this is a great book, particularly for those who love Kristeva (as I do). 
There are three interviews, the longest by Philippe Petit; one should 
definitely read this, but not as an introduction to Kristeva - instead, a 
kind of summing up, metacommentary, analysis.

21 Counter Daemons, Robert O. Harrison, Litmus Press, 2006, and Elemental 
Song, Robert O. Harrison, <Answer>, 2006. Harrison sent me these books. I 
thought they'd be problematic (he mentioned connection with computers). 
This worried me. Instead, they're two of the most brilliant books of 
poetry I've read, period. I hope to review them at greater length later. 
Counter Daemons reflects both daemons in unix/linux and Socrates' daemon. 
The "I" is insistent all the way through. Computer ideas are used beneath 
the surface; they don't dominate, they're not codework, not subtext. 
They're the dark matter of the writing. They suffuse the surface which is 
the depth; they're not beneath it. The "I" reminds me (everything reminds 
me of everything, apologies) of Nicanor Parra's Individual. It's demiurge, 
Vedic. In Elemental Song, the stanzas are unrhymed triplets. There is an 
"a" that begins the first five; there's a relation with the longer work. I 
want to mention these because everyone should buy them. They're two of the 
few books of writing I can carry around; they have that intimacy. The 
cover of CD is by Brenda Iijima, one of the best I've seen.

22 Mary Magdalen, The Essential History, Susan Haskins, 2005. This is just 
a terrific book to delve into. MM refuses framework, seeps; there is 
little to go on historically. Sexuality is there from the beginning, as 
perhaps are penitence and leadership. My Nikuko was partly based on MM; I 
think she figures through the Preraphaelites and the Victorian in general. 
In any case this is thoroughly researched stunning book that goes to the 
heart of western culture.

23 The Dark Philosophers, Gwyn Thomas, Library of Wales, 1946-2006. These 
three novelettes lie between Proust and P.D. James; the back cover insists 
Thomas Hardy and Damon Runyon. I want to recommend the depths of these; 
there is coal everywhere in the townscape, and the violence combined with 
almost feudal conditions resonates with the coal regions of Pennsylvania 
and West Virginia. I'm mesmerized by the stories (still haven't read the 
third).

24 The Talmud, The Steinsaltz Edition, Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz, Random 
House, 1989. The Talmud and its hermeneutics are useful and originary for 
textual analysis that mixes surface and depth inextricably. I want to 
mention in particular A Reference Guide, which accompanies the Tractates. 
There are sections on The Essential Nature of the Talmud, Aramaic, The 
Book, Talmudic Terminology, Talmudic Hermeneutics, Halakhic Concepts and 
Terms, etc. Some of the concepts defined and discussed: "There is no 
absolute chronological order in the Torah." "If it does not refer to..." 
"The verse speaks about the present." "Revealing something." This can 
usefully be read in conjunction with Marc-Atain Ouaknin's The Burnt Book, 
Reading the Talmud, perhaps the best book I've read on hermeneutics and 
the phenomenology of the text.

25 Tumult on the Mountains, Lumbering in West Virginia, 1770-1920, Roy B. 
Clarkson, first published 1964. I recommend this to anyone interested in 
forestry and its environmental impact; almost all the old (first growth) 
forest in West Virginia has disappeared. I never realized either the 
extent of the damage or the density of the original forests; they remind 
me of the old growth on Victoria Island. The Appalachians were almost 
tropical; now almost all of this is lost, and the rest is disappearing 
with the advent of mountain-topping. It's horrible; the Appalachians 
constitute literally one of the thickest and most variegated ecosystems in 
the world; as with the tropics, it's disappearing fast. The book is mainly 
revealing photographs; there's a great deal on logging locomotives which 
operated on somewhat different principles than the usual engines.

26 Hesiod's Theogony, translated and edited by Richard S. Caldwell, Focus 
Classical Library, 1987. Caldwell makes sense of the genealogy; that alone 
should give him a Pulitzer. The commentary is lengthy and excellent; if 
you're interested in the text, this will be of great use.

27 The Complete Kama Sutra, Alain Danielou, Park Street, 1994. The KS is 
one of the most and worst translated Sanskrit texts. This is an excellent 
one (as far as I can tell), with two commentaries, one traditional and one 
more or less modern. Because it's complete, there are sections on morals, 
economics, conduct, and so forth, in relation to sexuality and mores. It's 
far more interesting than the abbreviated versions.

28 Technological note again: I've been working with PAL cameras, both in 
Europe and the US, and find them so far superior to NTSC that the con- 
version and difficulty (in the US) is worth it. The reds stay red; they're 
not mixed in with the luminance, and don't blur. The additional lines make 
for a much sharper picture, somewhat close to HD. These cameras are more 
than sufficient for anything online, relatively inexpensive, and a joy to 
operate.

29, 30, 31, ... I wish I could read more, could go on! I'd like to cover, 
in depth, the work of Joe Amato and the post-Yasusada work of Kent 
Johnson. Amato's Virga Under is wonderful; I've been reading it on and 
off, but not enough to do anything but recommend it. The same goes for 
Kent Johnson's eloquent Lyric Poetry After Auschwitz. ... I've mentioned 
Marguerite Young before; at this point I think I have all of her work here 
- do check it out, give it time, delve into it; it's worth it. ... And I 
think I've mentioned Paul Young's The Cinema Dreams its Rivals, Media 
Fantasy Films from Radio to the Internet, which covers the interrelation- 
ships between film and video/cyberspace/radio and so forth; film is one of 
the most inert, "insoluble" media - the others are aerial, virtual, always 
already elsewhere. The interconnections among all of these reveal a lot 
about our culture. ... Just found, literally on the sidewalk, Donald E. 
Knuth's The TEXbook - TEX is a markup language developed by this famous 
programmer, and this book, from 1984-86 is a complete guide to it. There 
are a lot of escape keys and backslashings; the description is worth 
reading even if one doesn't employ TEX. ... In French: Dictionnaire de la 
prehistoire, Andre Leroi-Gourhan, Quadrige, Presses Universitaires de 
France, 1988-97 - a beautiful book for delving into the (roughly) current 
state of research in the field; there are probably thousands of sites 
listed. ... Les Guerres de Demain, Pascal Boniface, Seuil, 2001 - so many 
ways to die, so many types of war, we're always under the gun. I've been 
reading this on and off; it's not fun - it's eerie. ... La Suisse de la 
formation des Alpes a la quete du futur, pub Migros 1975 - I'd been 
looking for a book dealing with the political/cultural/geographic/histor- 
ical/etc. background to Switzerland; this seemed the best, in spite of its 
age. It was 5 fr for 700 pages! Something to read on the plane trip back. 
- English again: poems for teeth, Richard Loranger, We Press, 2005 - a 
wonderful book of poetry (pardon the use of the same superlatives over and 
over again) dealing with... teeth and their condition; it's oddly uncom- 
fortable to read, and I hope to get to this later. Each tooth has a 
section and a description - "Tooth of Memory" for example. I recommend 
this not only for its oddness, but for that very discomfort; teeth are an 
aporia of the body-bone itself, this is sensed throughout the book. - 
Finally, why not end on The Ladies' Home Journal Treasury, edited by John 
Mason Brown, Simon and Schuster, 1956? The writers include Eugene Field, 
Helen Keller, John Steinbeck, Bill Malden, Ethel Waters, Marianne Moore, 
Daphne du Maurier, Vachel Lindsay, and Jerome K. Jerome. There are full- 
color illustrations from covers, advertisements, and page layouts. Really 
recommended; it's a great view of America from, say, 1883 on.

== I offer no apologies for this close to endless listing (providing one 
is doing modular arithmetic!); all of the above are useful and exciting. 
I've been reading like a fiend, trying to keep up; so many of these back- 
ground my own writing (which admittedly is a poor excuse, but ah well...) 
- do check them out!
