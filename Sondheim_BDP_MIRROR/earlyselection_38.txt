The deadness of beauty's slope-gender, and the death of slope-pronoun
process (program output sample):

Hi? What's your name?
beauty

Well, beauty, let's get started! Let's make a gender!!
That ok with you?
yes

Oh well, let's get going!


What do you want to call this thing you're making?
slope

Well, slope already constructs trouble for us, subverting the categories
we take for granted. Beneath the surface, slope is 27982, neutral, yes?
But what is neutrality here, its constitution?

What pronoun has existed for 235688 hours?
slope - and you knew that all along!

Wait! slope and 27982 are gone forever!

For 3 days, I have already been in mourning...
