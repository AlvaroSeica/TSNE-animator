The Pennsylvanian Era and the Breakdown of the Hypothesis





There were no landscapes during the Carboniferous. Sigillaria or

neuropteris, the absence of a blank eye, the unremarking of an

occasion. Nothing heard that would mark that occasion. Calamites

for example left by the granularity of a sanded shallow, perhaps

more than usual. Unremarkable. This is what Rosset must have meant

later when he discussed the idiocy of the real in the absence of

this example. It is this, the uncanny breaking of a stem, tramp-

ling of a fern prothallus, that unravels _everything._ We exist

upon the branch of that unravelling. The remnants of scarring:

lepidodendron, there were others, each an enunciation. Nothing

had a name, one couldn't talk about the seasons. The virtual

subject covers the subject like a molecular membrane, split open.

She doesn't notice. She doesn't notice until the split spells

disconnect. This is what covers the structure of scarred tissue

you may have remembered from what was less than a nanosecond.

The mind is a contradiction splayed against time, its cunt opened

to an abyss. Rather it is a knot in the contradiction. Or rather 

again, a marking or remarking rendered a stem or trampling of a 

fern prothallus. It is this that breaks down the _hypothesis._
