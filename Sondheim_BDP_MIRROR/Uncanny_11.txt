Nacht

Be glad you're not me. Every night I go to sleep. It pummels me. It
brutalizes me. In sleep I am tortured, molested, hit repeatedly. I call
out sometimes in my sleep. I do not escape. Tonight I am walking with my
father. I say, I have 60 years to live. I am 53. The years crash down, 50,
40, 30, I say I have 30 years to live, 30 years of work ahead of me. I am
glad. The years collapse, 20, 10, they crash to nothing. I hear, I do
nothing. I hear, there is no time. Death slams me in the face. I think. I
have no time until the millennium. I think, I will not see the millennium,
what is that to me. I will die alone. I will die soon and alone and there
is no hope. My great vision has disappeared in little writings. I lose
thought everywhere. I am walking in a concrete building, perhaps an under-
pass. The walls are damp, encrusted. It is not that they are old, but they
watch me slam against the years. I work with a fury now. There is no time
left. I reach out to empty air. There is no one there. I wake. I see
grains everywhere, dark blue against dark grey. They swarm and say sure to
die and soon. I huddle, turn towards the light, flick it, crawl to mach-
ine, type this, shaking. There are no years left. This is a night and they
are all night coming and it is a gift I can write through them time to
time.
