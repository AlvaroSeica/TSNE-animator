Subject: Who

On Panix,
who - lists users
whoami - lists my name
who am i - gives my tty login
who a b c - gives me the strangest list of all... and I have no
idea why... and I may send this out, but beyond the
who mother loves - tty login
I can't tell where this command is coming from. I've tried various
abbreviations, combinations...
who a - is a quite nice obscure listing
Here it is; I've changed the lone period to a # so it wouldn't read as
end-of-file:

While I recognize these files (some of them) I have no idea what the list
refers to...

Have fun! What can YOU find with Unix WHO? (Unfair to use WHOIS, WHENCE,
WHEN, WHERE, WHERE AM I, WHEREAMI, WHENAMI, all of which might be opera-
tive on various systems.)
