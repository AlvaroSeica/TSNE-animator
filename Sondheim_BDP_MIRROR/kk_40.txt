Of the


Space cracks the mirror.
The mirror is rigid.
Hit me with a stick.
The mirror reflects only what is evident.
What is evident is not evidence.
If it is evidence, hit me with a stick.
Brown wood-frame around the mirror, dais beneath it, tain behind.
From an angle the wood-frame reflects in the mirror.
From no angle, the dais; from no angle, the tain.
Nor does the mirror reflect the mirror.
It is space that is reflected in the mirror.
No space, no mirror; no space, no reflection.
Hit me with a stick; the space is empty.
The stick is in space; the stick is reflected in the mirror.
Stick approaches the mirror, Crack! Crack!
The mirror is rigid.
There is more than one stick.
There is more than one space. 
There is one frame shifting in faultlines, fractures.
The frame is the world; the mirror is the world.
Crack! Crack!
