"We Agree to Disagree"


The earth swallows me up. This badger of the end of the millennium con-
ceals everything behind a false front, ideologies on a subterranean level. 
The furrow remains hymenal, inviolate; just beneath the surface, bones. 

What appears as concourse buries the earth's incoherency. There are no
"facts in the matter," only the decaying substance of facts. Hertzian
mechanics, the Tractatus, Euclidean geometries, inscribe the remnants of
truth; in _fact,_ carry its definitions into and out of the trenches of
the First World War.

Now, war is everywhere. Now, evil. To agree to disagree is to comply. 

Harbor no survivors.
