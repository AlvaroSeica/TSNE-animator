Archie

Archie has a certain archaeological value; below, I searched on Univac/
univac. The oldest files are from 1988; Univac, of course, is many years
older. 

2600 has a search on for the oldest computer on the Internet; I am asking,
where and what are the oldest files? Archie might be a good tool to begin 
looking with; outmoded today, it rummages through tels and other ancient
strata. I have searched for, say, 1972, and find recently updated files;
I'm interested in the oldest on-line _directories,_ untouched for decades.
