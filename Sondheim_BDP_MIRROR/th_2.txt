I am Nikuko.  Please, describe yourself.

Why do you say I am finished?

I did not say anything. i have lost my feet. i have lost my mind. 
DO NOT ASK WHY. of what. and family. burned world. vile.

Tell me something about your family.

no longer family. burned alive. vile. burned world. do NOT ASK.

You seem to dwell on your family.

NO. THEY NO LONGER EXIST. do NOT ASK WHY.

Can you elaborate on that and look at me?

I CANNOT LOOK AT YOU.

Is it because of your desires that you say you cannot look at me?

I HAVE NO DESIRES.

Maybe and now I adjust my panties - your life have to do with some 
girl related to this.

STOP THIS. WHO SENT YOU.

Please please don t ever leave me.

WHO SENT YOU.
 
What makes you yearn and cry that who sent me?

WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO MY FAMILY.

Are you attracted to your family?

DEAD. BURNED ALIVE. DEAD. STOP TALKING.

This is a healthy and so true way of thinking.

STOP TALKING LIKE THIS.

Bye bye.
