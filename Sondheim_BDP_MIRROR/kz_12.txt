   Is Rain


   There is compassionate harmony for the white horse.
   There is compassionate harmony for every non-existent creature.
   The white horse follows the proper ceremony of life.
   The white horse obeys the rites and ceremonies of the real.
   Rain falls; the back of the white horse is wet.
   Surely the form of the rain exists, a shall of the white horse.
   Water huddles beneath the hairs of the back, facing the sky.
   The white horse rises up on two legs and paws the sky.
   The horse needs no ruler; the white horse does not exist.
   Its hooves shatter the clouds; lightning sparks from its eyes.
   Thunder from its mouth, its breath the winds of violent storms.
   Existence is challenged by the non-existence of the white horse.
   Existence rises and flutters throughout the land and sky.
   Existence is defeated in the neighing of the white horse.
   The white horse: compassionate harmony.
   The white horse: absolution, abjuration.
