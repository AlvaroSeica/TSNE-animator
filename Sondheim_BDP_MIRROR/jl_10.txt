Warning from the Cape Breton Post!


"As for warning signs that your child may be spending too much time on the
net, police suggest to watch for the following - withdrawal from family
and friends; use of vocabulary heavy with computer terms; lack of interest
in appearance or indications or (sic) lack of sleep suggesting an all
night on-line session and computer files stored on disk ending in GIF,
JPG, MPG, AVI, MOV, BMP, TIF, PCX, or GL, as they represent graphic image
files." 

Whole worlds appear from everywhere and enter into everywhere; what was
once the specific provenance of _capital_ now applies to ontology itself.
