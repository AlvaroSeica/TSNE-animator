i about fear the writing world & about the tremble world with its tremble
name with its fear name writing closing my eyes & trembling the world, do
tremble ears, the fearing trembling, trembling, the mouth, the mouth

i fear writing about the world & tremble with its name

closing my eyes & trembling the world, do tremble

closing my eyes & ears, & fearing the world, do fear

the world fearing & trembling, closing my mouth

fearing the name of the world
