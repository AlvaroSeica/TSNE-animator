hello

go to this evening lovely reading and all the poets are there -
and i sit on a chair next to one of two i know, there -
and i say you know - all the poets know all the poets -
but me i'm thinking of events far away, storms and petrels,
birds flying high and furious near the bleak fall of night,
just at the edge when the lip of night begins its floundering,
there's night-froth, wild night-wind at the descent, there's death
and rebirth glowing in dark howls, waves, night-earth beneath and
violent, full of sulphur spew - i can't think - miserable, mesmerized
and hopeful - wander out, take the evening subway, listen
from a distance, sound of someone weeping
