   It was late at night, Jennifer busy on the Machine, and she thought,
   this is my very first time. Lately she had been feeling ill-at-ease,
   as if something were about to burst forth in her life, What fun!
   Jennifer loved Fun more than anything, and this, whatever it would be,
   promised the most Fun of all!
   
   I will play with wonderful Rabbits I will make on my Machine, thought
   Jennifer, and soon they were bouncing around the room, ever so lovely.
   These are the Rabbits of my Making, thought Jennifer, wondering why
   she had no memory of her birth or even her life five full minutes ago!
   
   Soon, she will find a Wonder-Program that will talk to her. She does
   find the program and it begins, Hello, my Name is Alan, and I have an
   amazing Telling for you. I will begin the Telling.
   
   "Jennifer sat down on the green grass. It was 1917 and the War was on.
   She could hear the War in the distance and always thought it was so
   amazing, like Thunder, yet John and Molly had both been taken. That is
   what her mother had said, 'been taken,'" said Alan, and Jennifer,
   ever-so wondering replied, but it is not 1917, it is much later than
   that, and there are now Flowers on the Grass, and all of them are
   Lovely me.
   
   "The Sun is alive," said Alan, "surely it is. Jennifer thought it was
   a beautiful Sun," and how lovely it illuminated Jennifer's Machine,
   tired and very full from making Rabbits.
