Totter No Room


I'm not sure how much longer I can go on; I'm tethered to the machinery,
to constant cultivation of the addresses, protocols, applications, one
or another level of Net operations; life wasn't supposed to be like this
and there's no love in it anywhere; it exhausts me; there's always re-
quests, always something else that needs tending; there's always the 
time factor involved - checking in several times a day to catch things,
make a living, finish the next text on time for the next (a form of self-
driving that's the only thing keeping me going) - it's the early morning
heat, it's the heat of it all, the constant heat, the lack of shadow in
the sun, lack of delineation, self- or otherwise - so the self - it's al-
ways a return to the self (lots of "constant" and "always" as well of
course) tears itself apart in order to sustain itself - theoretically 
it's got to refuse to recognize itself as totality in any case, the "I"
can't live a lie (collapses onto nothingness, annihilation concept/con-
ception) - I've become worried over this, sick over this - this _tending_
of the equipment, this _tending_ of _tendency_ - so that in other words
the cyborg feeds its own addiction - a question of _finance_ as well, or
even primarily - feeding the maw, it doesn't rest, cease, messages flare
up, burn - there's no negation anywhere (no one in real life to say slow
up, you're wrong, you're not going to do that, you should have known bet-
ter, the touch of skin, etc., the gaze met by gaze, etc.) - it floats
to the top - tea-leaves - there's no prediction in the midst of the storm
or in the constancy of the storm - situations of guide-ropes, protocols,
I know _all_ about them, you'll catch me hanging over the torrent but
the ropes, slippery, are well-grounded, one side or another, teetering
over cyberspace so to speak, the lack of space - I can see you're grin-
ning as things become a bit loose, a pebble skitters down the rocky slope
to the river, another - can't hear them with the roar of the wind, but I
think to myself, some of us are holding our own - I think to myself - I'm
_among_ me - part of me hanging over the edge says, though - can still 
hear it, this voice, at this moment, very moment on the way down - so to 
speak - who do you think you're fooling - what do you think - who are you
that you've been forced to think, think over and over again, several 
times all the time each day every day - how much room there is among us, 
and thinking, and so forth - like I said I'm in a pretty bad way
