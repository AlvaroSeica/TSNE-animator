Apology for his Life While Traveling


that he is sorry
that he is filled with disgust

stale again, scattered what might spatter against theory, devolving
against this bit of biography - I am not home, but elsewhere - a
meaning of scattered responses spattered while traveling, against 
theory or its wall, the wall of theory. what I mean is, unthinking
or unable to prepare the scattered grounds of thought. I will dream
this or that. it will remain a Dream. the fingers unfurl air. this
which will I can remain unfocused at the seen. I will wonder am I 
dead and furthermore, what spattered drama robs what is inherited,
of coherence. my dreams curl emptied there. I will have said it all
"this blind ambition" that I will have said it all. this which is
remaining stale and scattered. that it is blocked, the road at night
or in night. that the machinery has vanished, protocols forgotten:
as for wires, air, fibers, all transmitting into stale and scattered
smoke. spattered theories while others have management of living.
stolen theories while others are capital, coherent, walls. scattered
grounds while others are you know (whom you know). 1. that it has 
all be said. 2. that someone has said it. 3. that scattered travel
spatters wires and you-know-noise. where I keep my hand in, where I
keep yours.

                                             something about disgust
               and that will say as well the something about theory
