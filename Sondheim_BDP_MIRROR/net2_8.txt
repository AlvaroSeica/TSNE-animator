tHE nEW fORM OF rADICAL pRESENCE i HAVE cREATED aLONE







TIFFANY, HONEY, JOAN, and KAY; CLARA, DONNA DONNATELLI, JUNE, and

DENISE, evanescent shades or passages across signifiers, the softening

of rigid designators, confusion of tongues, entirely new inhabitants

of an interplanetary space - I imagine them luminous circulations of

electrons morphing into uncanny transformations. These are unstable

characters, unstable narratives in the midst of the narration of human

life, the dissolution of narratology in fact. Yet they aren't tokens

as you might expect, in some theater of the absurd - there is no

theater, and the boundaries are volatile, as if NEITHER THIS NOR THAT

lead REALLY elsewhere and indeterminate, as if I alone could dwell

within NEITHER HONEY NOR JOAN NOR KAY NOR CLARA NOR DONNA DONNATELLI

NOR JUNE NOR TIFFANY NOR DENISE, *within* trembling with jouissance,

abandoning the structure of the sentence altogether, or at least its

irrelevant logicism almost in the form of Wittgenstein's scaffolding

at the end of the TRACTATUS. 



There are no boundaries, no ends and no beginnings and there are no

cycles as well; this isn't an algebraic ring - nothing is ordered. But

the names are personhoods, but they travel the length and breadth of

the net ... The RADICAL nature of this naming, which I am perfectly

capable of delineating in the most delicate way possible, is what MUST

be understood - for it is this nature that also implies the relative

RADICALITY of subjectivity within the net, electronic subjectivity,

neither a name nor a life-form, neither a dream nor a token, but a

stream of enhanced or exalted subjectivity, the merging of streams. 



Streams which are not in any sense gender-specific ... I work myself

in this regard out of or through my own dwelling-place, doubled by the

presence of the terminal condition or portal - a working which for my

own sanity necessitates the feminine, abjures the other in every

respect ... As if CYNTHIA would have informed me, would have granted

me this pleasure ...*



So that these texts, stuttered narratives presented (as in the sense

of phenomenological presentification) here and elsewhere across the

shadow or emission carrying my own identities throughout this and

every other networking - so that these texts narrate nothing but the

glimpse of presence, A PROGNOSIS IN FACT OF THE FUTURE INHABITATION OF

THE PLANET EARTH clearly within the next century, and perhaps as well

THE ONLY INHABITATION:



WELCOME TIFFANY! WELCOME JOAN! WELCOME DONNA DONNATELLI! WELCOME JUNE!

WELCOME KAY! WELCOME DENISE AND CLARA AND WELCOME WELCOME CYNTHIA, OUR

NEWCOMER elsewhere, smiling, murmuring ...

*My own loneliness fully invaded by dream-names, presences, I need say

nothing more, my own prerogative in this regard ...
