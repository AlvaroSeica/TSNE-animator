Hacker Drive

Consider a _hacker drive_ towards perfect plastic foreclosure, PC-alter/
altar (Nesta Stubbs), towards BWO; you can turn this image around from
Deleuze/Guattari into eternal-perfect-digital-intelligence, information-
fluxes (Chislenko) filtered towards keen-knives-edgings. That the schizz
would then _ruffle_ criss-cross Web-spidering, skittering laterally across
lamina/pagings. Think of _continuous_ foreclosure beyond BWO tentacular
interaction with organism (keyboard, mouse, camera, microphone), spiders-
skittering-spiders, autonomic Web: available holographic windows for peer-
age (_look what it's doing now!_). So that we provide the power: _it_ pro-
vides the content, internal comprehension of mathesis, solutions, univer-
sals, languagings, virtual subjectivities - so that _hacker drive_ comes
close to, say, _death drive_ mythos: here you have immobilized solidity of
silicon-thought, perfection of Sheffer-stroke crystalline (non-Penrose)
structures (Wittgenstein, TLP). There you have it schizzed across the map,
cutting-through hacked enclave after enclave (Mike Davis), proper-named
out of defuge (Sondheim) - the _hacker drive_ which tends towards what
_gives us our given future._
