(in the mountains, 3)



dawn, aube, the shades down, no birds, nothing, flight none within the
room, no dreams, nothing, words coming through the space of the night,
none, empty, quietude of leaden skies...

chilled, bursting-point of energy-flows, plants, the gardening, tending
of the night, crystal lights from cars in rural areas, eyes opening,
beached pebbles where the ocean temporarily relinquishes control of the
space of the other...

dawn, aube, another tiny miracle of mourning...
