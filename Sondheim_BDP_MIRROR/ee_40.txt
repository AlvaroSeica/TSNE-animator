Plezz Raoul Vaneigem, The Book of Pleasures:


"Putting intense pleasure first prepares for the end of separate thought."

Upgrading pleasurably, the external model disabled still and too lazy to
download-o 32-bit, I turn black and white quickcam-o onto the screen-
saver. Now I tend-o to run around here in underpants if dressed at all; o
o o o it gives the body-o a cleaner space to glide-o, and then when what?
My white image, band-o across the middle skirting on the screen, maybe
I'll wear a skirt-o, dance and prance-o? Who's to know-o, o o o o, maybe
I'll naked self-o just everywhere! Heh-o. So to be sure-o, its glassy-
like, glass-o, just me and me image where the comp-o once sat-o.  What
could be nicer? My arms-o move operat-o, here-o and there-o, swish wish!
You can't follow them-o for the blurrrrr-o. Huge waves of light gray-o
dance across the glass-o me! My mouth-o opens and closes with delight-o
with the sync-o! Sometimes in and sometimes out-o, o o o o!  You can only
imagine! Gaping maw-o, maw-maw-o, swallows screen-o hole-o, o o o o!  Now
I'm in me-o! There's nothing ought to look at-o! o o o o! So much delay I
am where I was-o! And I'll be where I am-o! So much of it to swallow!
