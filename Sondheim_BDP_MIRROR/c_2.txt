For my Secret Love



The screen stares at me. What does it say.

It says little Alan wants to come out and play. 

It says you haunt me. It says I am prey.

The flower is green. The stem too. Slay

The contrite edges, the glass. Stay

The growth of the grass. Your footsteps may

Furrow or cleft so that I follow, at bay

What Whitman meant, electric body a day

Turned from the night. I am not an easy lay

But for you at lunar edge I howl, bray

At moon, from terminal depression turned away,

My arms akimbo, my legs a split or splay,

My voice a neigh upon the sward or ley.

This is an image of a world gone clear and grey,

Gone queer or gay, gone straight or bent, a ray

Turned as well from crazed and lunar night? Nay,

The two of us entwined, and happy? Yay!,

Of course we are! While sun shines, making hay

And overhead amidst the blue, a jay

Floats by the sky. It's a lovely time to pray

Each of us to us, and in both senses, "fey":

Whimsical, disordered, near-death body-flay,

Towards beautiful food for us, perhaps cray-

Fish or not. We found it sleeping by the quay!

Delightedly, each offered the other to pay

For this dark morsel launched upon the tray

For lunch, now happily returned to sea, a stray

Just like ourselves! We're now so far, hooray!

From terrors, pains, ennui, the sickness of decay 

Remains behind. I call you by your true name, Hey!

You laugh, toss back to me the pearlescent spray

I left with you so long ago. You'll bless and spay

Me and I'll die, whistling tensely in the clay,

And knowing you lead or follow, this dark way

Where we have loved upon deserted paths, ay

Dark with memories, black stems no God can fray,

Repay, betray, today.
