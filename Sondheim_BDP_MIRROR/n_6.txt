After my Time


Reading Emerson's maternal oversoul, hopeless interspersing of totalities
among postmodernity's fractal deconstructions of knowledge, coming to
this/these texts that have emerged from my back's fissure. Turning back to
my inability to face myself in a mirror at any age, returning to the very
_triteness_ of shattered mirrors, cyber- or otherwise. Transforming hardly
possible, considering. That I am living beyond my time, that my listing of
Lautreamont, Chatterton, Joan of Arc, Lucan, Dickinson, that my listing of
dues, Kristeva, Nietzsche, Quine, that I should have died.  Ruining my
writing by writing. Killing myself by remaining alive. Watching language
sink into the pores, unlike Hendrix, Joplin, Wilson, unlike Bird, Mozart,
unlike Gorky, that my listing of dues, Acconci, Aycock, Immendorf, listing
of Wilke, Wittgenstein, fucking them all, that I am pricing myselves' fear
of death, that it was doing, hammering it down until the skin exploding.
Reading them they should have, speaking a word, silencing, dying. Losing
and dying, silencing. That I should be dying. No reason for living for no
reason for writing. Writhing and should be silencing. Writhing and praying
the should.
