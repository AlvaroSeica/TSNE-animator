The Beginning of the Address on the MOO


Gentlemen and gentlewomen, Who are we? What is the occasion of our
presence in this square, with the decidedly deciduous oaks <laughter>
surrounding our humble assembly?

Did we not wander through the desert and its protocols for years be-
fore enlightenment? But what is the nature of this enlightenment, and
how are we come to discover the square, not invent it? What great
force has placed all the accoutrements of civilization at our dispos-
al? <murmurs>

These are not, I believe, idle questions. They pertain to the heart of
things, this division between natural and artificial which is already
contradicted by the presence of language flooding our world, in fact,
is it not true that the natural can be mispelled in this place?

And is this an artifact, then, or the very real atomic-molecular con-
stitution of the way things are? <sounds of disconcerting, murmurs>

We are perplexed. Elsewhere, there are great binaries, so we are told,
and an answer may or may not lie there. Are binaries inherent in the
makeup of all things, even what is already spelled?

Are there things unspelled? Worlds unspelled? <sounds of uneasiness>

Are there worlds? <sounds of dis-ease>

<great pause in the midst of confusion>
