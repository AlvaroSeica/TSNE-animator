			    Shadow-Vowels


  why fly, cwm and syzygy, y and w shadowing the rest, hovered above
		     "the surface of pure breath"
		 turned towards SOUND you might hear
		      words apparently expressed
			     "cry syzygy"

     some words stop the THROAT in action, think your sound-body
		     GOBBLING air, BREATHE ME IN
	there inside of you I reach out through HOLES of light
		and pure splendour, your SHADOW inside
			     "try syzygy"

	 my LIFE passes with these pills difficult to swallow
	  tonight I tried to write autobiography once again
		   found myself in the THICK of it
	       GNAWED APART by THESE FILES ARE CORRUPT
			     "by syzygy"

	   THE LONG AND SHORT OF YOU IN THE MOUNTAIN VALLEY
			     "by the cwm"
