What I was Saying All Along, Jennifer


"Rather than obscure the basic melody, conventional symbols have been used
for most ornaments. This allows the user to ignore the embellishments dur-
ing the first reading. Once the basic melody is solidly committed to memo-
ry, then, as Johnny Wilmot would say, 'you put in the dirt' (by substitut-
ing embellishments and adding melodic variation.)" (From Paul Stewart
Cranford's introduction to Jerry Holland's Collection of Fiddle Tunes.)

It's not as if the freighter presented one side or another; now, with the
wind and rain,it turns slowly in the middle of the harbor, one doesn't
have to travel anywhere... 

As dirt lends itself to the analog, the body, smeared and stained, escapes
the digital domain.
