Julu says "I want that cement block."
Julu says "I want that cement block of surety."
Julu says "I want it in the middle of a cement plain."
Julu says "beneath a cement sky."
Julu says "a sun of cement."
Julu says "the cracks or contours showing like seams."
Julu says "a summer dress."
Julu says "in the heat but always there."
Julu says "a slow crawl, cement tides."
Julu says "solitons."
Julu says "a pretty dress beneath a sun."
Julu says "dress of cement."
Julu says "There I will lie and turn on my side."
Julu says "There I will stretch and sit."
