the pictures are coming perfectly along. I've been reading an Indo-Euro-
pean grammar. the book on the IE peoples is based on an old and totally
absurd triadic scheme. mysticism should be kept out of any form of re-
search and applied if at all as an afterthought by people roaming the
street thinking of other things. the nicest thing about the human species,
if it is one, is how sloppy it is, and then how pathetically it tries to
tidy up things with all sorts of schemata that comes out of one or another
of its orifices, usually the mouth, which itself is such a letdown. 

the species is a thing, then, with a mouth, you say? would you care to say
further, is there more to add? what of this thing called the species? do
you say, group mind? do you say hive mind? do you insist on internet and
hive mind internet or group mind internet? i replied.

this tidying, what is it? is this the political economy of the sign, is it
a strategic abstraction, collapsing everything to the conceivable expan-
sion of a single stroke? is the mouth the locus of the stroke? the cunt?
the belly? womb? hole? what constitutes the inked well of the inscription?

is there anyone behind all of these things, she wondered, but feared to
say aloud. she feared no one. she feared no one at all. she thought,
doubly, the body is a huge sponge. she thought the body is a huge sponge.

it was / is / will be.
