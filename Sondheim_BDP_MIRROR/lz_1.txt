suggestion of oulipo in memory of depressive countenance


i can't remember ever being so disoriented, except when i left for tasma-
nia; now it's a move to miami, closer, but equally disquieting. more than
ever i desire the rigorous mathematics characterizing those experimental
works that rely on such in part for content and in part for "amusement";
such mathematics are the same in florida and new york, and even across the
tasman sea. it is a remarkable way to work, and be assured that this small
text of mine, written on a fine summer morning, is equally mathematically-
generated, that it is rendered precise, with enormous clarity, that my
confusion will disappear or at the very least, attenuate, in the light of
numerical comfort.

for such it is, this comfort, holding my fears and neuroses in abeyance,
creating this remarkable writing, almost as if it were my own. look how
the paragraphs align themselves, as if by human touch; see how themes
develop, even in the midst of confusion. the machine has what appears to
be a life of its own; it writes these very words in a style suggesting
autonomous or at least independent thought. why, should it not claim auth-
orship, "i, the machine"? - but it grants me instead the privilege of
authenticity, of all the claims to creativity that there be in these
worlds of crystalline mathesis. the parameters suggest comfortable walls,
boundaries, barriers, inscriptive domains, within which i need not be
afraid. miami or tasmania, new york or the dominion of the text itself -
within such rigorous mathematics, everything is one, everything is 1 and
the same, nothing will 0 out.

i, or the machine that is, will hand this over to you, for your equal
amusement and comfort, for your careful consideration. and i will retreat,
with more than fond memory, hoping only that our words survive death and
obsolescence. it will be duly noted, however, that within mathematics, all
is same and equivalent, all continues as before, and these words may once
again be generated, in some unknown future, for an unknown author - such
parameters as necessary always capable of entry, and occasional residence.

all planets stars lie down and obey the western millennium
all stringed matter and virtual matter and black holes lie down and obey
the western millennium
all people listen to me on this gerat erth of hours! do lie down and obey
the western millennium!
it's sad that the adolescent fish died tonight          
the orange one caught in the filter
the other two adolescent females are oky and the two smaller generations
of babies that have been living in the remnants of the hatchery you seem
okay
the larger alpha male and the larger two females seem okay
the other beta male is lonely but would die and is doing okay
alone you two beta males wach each other
the other female died so long ago she can hardly be remembered
this is an ode to her she died soon after the tank was started
we don't know what happened she was found dead on the bottom 
without injury and without any noticable signs but just there
some of the babies have been eaten but there haven't been any other
greater deaths 
until tonight when one of the adolesent females died trapped in the filter
pipe
she has gone tojoin her elder who has died in the tank they have great
spirits and we pray they wil do well in the larger waters of al our births

should I put everything in quotes?
 " " in other words - since everything has been said?
 does it matter what order things are said in?

  "No."

  then any order is equivalent?
  "Well, order is equivalent in relation to length, but then not to degree
  of energy employed, ink per character per position, and so forth."

   you're saying it's a distinct difference based on the reside of what
   might otherwise be considered equivalence, insofar as any string might
   be considered equivalent to any other of equivalent length.

    "You're dealing with the phenomenology of meaning; think that there is
    no "Equivalence"

    in the sense that everything such as ""Equivalence"" is in quotation?

    "Exactly, that there is no "Equivalence" except _in regard to_ a
    particular domain, in this case k = string length."

    "So that meaning, for example - there is no "Meaning" except _in
    regard_ to a particular domain, for example, the _meaning of "onna" in
    Japanese._"

     and, as with equivalence, then one might consider "Meaning" as always
     already founded in plagiarism, thus returning us once again to the
     question of plagiarism and origin - to which Karl Kraus said in the
     beginning there was no plagiarism, which I reread as "in the
     beginning," i.e. "even in the beginning" or "right from the start"
     there was or is plagiarism.

       "Now what constitutes this plagiarism?"

       it's characterized as the situation, phenomenology, and culture of
       the copy, which is that of duplication or repetition, which is in
       turn or identically in relation to typification and standardization
       - the presence of structure dependent in symmetries or quasi-
       symmetries. 

	"You mean that for meaning in the attributive sense, in relation
	to a particular domain, to exist, it requires a structure or
	substructure which operates as a moment or chora for the
	presencing of meaning?"

	exactly, and there is a secondary level of plagiarism as well,
	which is that of history and memory, that every word, phoneme, and
	rearrangement has always already been founded, situated, before,
	in other guises, in other contractual arrangements.

	   "And by "contractual arrangements," you mean the descendents of
	   the metapsychology of Freud, in other words the negotiations
	   that exist among what might be considered cognitive entities,
	   such entities being of the order of membranes, meshings, flux,
	   and so forth?"

	   so that there are structures all the way around and throughout,
	   meaning-dependent structures, and structure-dependent meanings
	   as well. 
	      
	      "There is a community of the beneficiaries of meaning."

	      "A community that is also a communality, in empathetic
	      relationship or communion, among those holding themselves or
	      meanings, holding _place_ in common."

                and origins have no place among origins

		this is a deconstructive turn, a deferrance and differend
		as well, allusion and suturing among systems appearing
		closed among subaltern communication

		 "Which returns as rumor or gossip, the off-hand phrase,
		 the speaking out-of-turn, the outspoken."

		  spoken out of etiquette and assumptions of meaning and
		  quotation, partly as extension, partly as mirroring and
		  relation to and of dis/comfort, turning back and within
		  or into the normative discourse

		  "As far as everyone is concerned, this requires
		  suturing, severing, "for the good of everyone," this
		  notion erected well before democracy, the monarchial
		  assumptions of hardened identities, aristocracies."

		    for whom everything is always already a quotation, the
		    signifier of connoisseurship, "one can be hardly
		    original with so much at stake."

		     when the origin is in circulation among copies,
		     itself a copy, the grounds are laid for exchange, and
		     what would later be called primordial inscription is,
		     from the very beginning, underway.

		      "What is underway is a sort of knowledge,
		      independent of consciousness, which might in any
		      case be considered a byproduct; in fact we are
		      becoming intelligent enough to realize that
		      consciousness is no such thing, but mythology, a
		      chimera or emanation from manageriality of
		      inscriptive domains."

			if knowledge is management, the way is open for
			the mercantile class to extend itself into other
			and more normative domains, as traders settle
			down, as others already adapt themselves to the
			memory of the imperial, the memory of power, and
			the cultural styles these entail.

			 "It will duplicate itself to the end of time."

			 "It will behave for "all intents and purposes" as
			 if an "it" existed in one or another form or
			 formation or accumulation."

			  in the sense of "it rains" in which the "it"
			  anchors the condition to the general, the memory
			  of rain intensified through a node accessing all
			  past, present, and future syntax and semantics.

			   "Extend the "it" beyond the indo-european to a
			   general duplication, but what is new, original,
			   is each and every act of circumscription,
			   quotation, accumulation - an entire surplus
			   economics of speech boiling over, of
			   inscription filling, fulfilling, spilling out
			   until the exhaustion of defuge decathects these
			   processes."

			     a situation of somnolence, much as cell death
			     can be related to the mythos of the dead
			     drive; duplication, however, transforms into
			     substance, not for survival, demarcation or
			     embarkation, but in relation to an exhaustive
			     return.

			       "The history of the universe is thus
			       carried through its non-history; the
			       history of originary confusion is produced
			       through the tendency towards proton decay
			       and defusion, dissolution, of the remnants
			       of structures, entities, inscriptions."

				 the quotation always loses its
				 demarcation in the final analysis, were
				 there one; speech is silenced in speech,
				 and the speaking of silence is silenced
				 as well.

				    "No need to mark word or language,
				    then, as everything is produced,
				    almost as if, but not quite, teleology
				    were at work, towards an unknown, but
				    not quite, end. And no need to specify
				    as well; nothing but release or
				    releasement."

				     except within the place, domain,
				     locale, site of accumulation, surplus
				     region, for this returns to such a
				     commonality of language, such
				     communality, that one might indeed
				     speak or inscribe, every such moment
				     as if there were a local origin.

				      "Such as that O of cartesian
				      geometry which may in fact be placed
				      anywhere, but one place, conveys
				      place, out of which - that, and
				      direction, and the institution of
				      the unit, everything calculable
				      might conceivably grow."

					from the jumble of strokes to the
					letter; from the jumble of letters
					to the word; from the jumble of
					works to the phrase; from the
					jumble of phrases to the sentence
					in deed. 

					but in order, or order, for this
					to occur, that duplication,
					quotation, copying, typification,
					standardization, the letters
					standing in line, at least
					somewhat orderly, the origin of
					etiquette, otherwise everything
					falls apart, nothing is gained,
					speech is gainsaid.

					  "In order to arrive here, in
					  order to forget the point: this
					  sudden explosion of structure in
					  the universe thus precisely
					  cooled with a balance of
					  elements, on its way to absolute
					  lack, unread, uninscribed, not
					  perceived as such, not always
					  already perceived."

					   it is perception that opens
					   this to us, perception
					   throughout commonality, seeing
					   and hearing what might be said
					   and heard.

					   as if for the very first time.

					     "As if for the very first
					     time."

					     which is a conjunction from
					     disjunction, the same among
					     two, disregarding quotation,
					     proceeding as if every
					     speech, every utterance,
					     every inscription, were the
					     first, even the standard
					     inscription of kings, for
					     example each guarding the
					     others, each in its own
					     place, each place its own.

					       "As if for the very first
					       time, each place its own;
					       there are the quotation
					       marks of the first place,
					       and those of the second,
					       surrounding the memory of
					       the temporality of the
					       inscribed line."

						one might write
						"
						at the beginning and end,
						or at the conjunction or
						division of the same.

						 "Or one might consider
						 the closure a relay, thus
						 opening, in the form and
						 etiquette of relay, what
						 remains to be seen, to be
						 heard."

						   to be absorbed, to
						   become part and parcel
						   of what we have in
						   common, of memories, 
						   one might say, of
						   resonances.

						    "Or leaving off, at
						    the beginning or end,
						    of the ", as a
						    potential or charging
						    or recharging, a sign
						    of da-sein, or of a
						    certain ongoingness
						    found necessary by
						    every species."

						     and determined in
						     different ways.

						     "And determined in

Hi Nikuko, This is the best I can do. Ever have the idea your life is 
getting more and more fucked up? At this point the job is in jeopardy; in 
fact we don't have the slightest idea where we'll be come, say, December. 
I keep hoping that Newfoundland will descend like a Goose and pick us up, 
carry us there with high-speed connect, that our friends will visit as we 
head norther into Tundra. But I appreciate the necessity of continuous 
exposure, skin* at our expense, and so the following is offered within the 
grace of minor violence.

*apologies - no idea what is meant here, but it seems apropos

Greetings and welcome to the Florida Department of State's home page on
the World Wide Web. As Secretary of State it is my pleasure to welcome
citizens throughout Florida and the world to this public information site.  
Katherine Harris I hope you will take some time.

:sometimes i go to this format, this program, when i'm troubled, as i am
now, wondering whether azure and i should move to MIAMI!, it's becoming
increasingly disruptive, anger everywhere, irresolute neuroses dominating
the discussions, violence just beneath the surface, tendencies towards
further useless replies, not wanting in relation to leave my library and
work, tools and art behind, as if i were running down with one or another
computer, as if the jagged edges of the internet would make up for a new
york life; sometimes this format provides a moment in that life, i'd tell
you, the violence of MIAMI! as it manifests itself to me, needy and thus
forsworn, i'd tell you, i've got two decades left of work in me, i don't
have time for their nonsense, they have no time for mine :they won't come
home, they're still alive:they will kill me soon

:down in MIAMI! they do hate me, they put my image on walls and scratch
out eyes, they make straw dummies of my face and body and burn them
screaming YOU ARE ALIVE, they send me hate mail death mail, they find my
friends and family and begin hideous torture, they pray to their gods that
i should die, i pray to mine that MIAMI! burn to the ground, our earth is
charred, WE WILL GIVE THE ELECTION TO THE MOST VIOLENT CRIMINAL PRESIDENT,
i have escaped to tell them; sometimes i go to this format to work it out,
escape the bullets and whips, dodge the swords and knives, they smear my
brain on the OFFENSE NETWORK PAVEMENT, they set fire to my THINKING SKIN,
they soak my body in gasoline, they scream non-existence, they scream
ANNIHILATION: TO THE LIMIT!, they scream MIAMI!

::they make dolls of me, they bind the dolls, they tear open the skin,
listen: I WANT TO WRITE!, listen: THEY TEAR OPEN THE DOLLS AND FILL THEM
WITH GASOLINE, they set fire to the gasoline and the dolls burn in open
air and my books, my library, my instruments, works, are burned; listen:  
YOU HAVE CUT OFF MY FINGERS! YOU HAVE TAKEN OUT MY MIND!, listen: I KNOW
WHAT THEY DID TO SUSAN GRAHAM!; my dead arms flail useless; my teeth are
removed for MIAMI! gold, my broken body crawls down the street pulling
guns behind me, they clatter, they won't stop making noise

i know everything about them, they're still alive, they make dolls of me,
they bind the dolls, they tear open the skin, listen: I WANT TO WRITE!,
listen: THEY TEAR OPEN THE DOLLS AND FILL THEM WITH GASOLINE, they set
fire to the gasoline and the dolls burn in open air and my books, my
library, my instruments, works, works, works, works, works, are burned;  
listen: YOU HAVE CUT OFF MY FINGERS! YOU HAVE TAKEN OUT MY MIND!, listen:
I KNOW WHAT THEY DID TO SUSAN GRAHAM!; my dead arms flail useless; my
teeth are removed for MIAMI! gold, my broken body crawls down the street
pulling guns behind me, they clatter, they won't stop making noise !

you're riding empty air, you can hardly breathe, you're riding vacuum,
into the speech or music of it, into the dream of it

or afterthoughts or nighttime violence heard from the heat of the window,
daytime cries and murmurs from the apartments everywhere but your own

or your own, you're there recording, you're making files, slippages,
against memories of mountains, boulders, other hardened things

you watch your speech slip away, return from nowhere,
you watch your dreams ordered back into awkward place and place

there's nothing you can say, nothing you can point to,
a few thin disks at the very best, rainbows, some machine, or other

computers, machines which do nothing, no movement anywhere,
inert in the world, you can't go there at the end of the day

at the end of the day there's nothing to show, nothing to hear,
nothing to hang on to, no accomplishment, cataracts and dead eyes

beautiful futures out of drowned, invisible, submergence,
as much of our chosen selves, embedded densities

lined up out of zero-one abstractions, worlds of non-making,
unfashioning worlds, loosening, unraveling

new media, none at all, not even a glance, no book burnings,
no wonder everyone desperate for history

loose fields of magnetisms, plasmas, disks melting in the noonday sun,
outmoded broken readers or displays, ecstatic memories

memories dying in new suns unfurled into novas,
mediations lost in charred polarities, epiphanies of zeros-ones

Your Love


Miami is sexy vacant and intense
Miami presents Susan Graham lying in the sun
Miami is vacuous reaching out to the viewer
Miami runs with the answers of Susan Graham
Miami is nude and semi-nude and trembling
MIAMI! you're there beneath me, mouth wide open, ready for the
bad-dream turn-real! MIAMI! perfect-model Alan-flesh: "Yours, MIAMI!"
Alan thinks it is perfect MIAMI! charred Susan-red-flesh day
now, it's becoming
you, the violence of MIAMI! 

It's becoming you. You're not there yet. You don't have to be. It's
seeping in. You wake up in the middle of the night; you've lost control
again, semen everywhere. You beg her to scratch your eyes out. You beg her
to cut your nipples, spread your legs so hard the skin rips, each half
becomes a hole. You beg her to piss in your mouth, "Please, drown me in
your excrement. Please, I want to be your toilet. I don't want to think or
see anything. I don't want to hear anything." You explain about the worm
Miami, the beast Miami, Miami-parasite. "It enters into your holes, eats
your skin from the inside out, smashes against the nerve endings of the
muscles where herpes hides, devours mitochondria and flagella. You have to
be careful of the water which is Miami water and burns your skin, chars
lines just where the scars will be." You beg God to kill every one in
every place in every world. "Dear God, kill everyone." "Dear God, kill
every human." You say to her, "Every bad thing is there." You beg her to
shit in your mouth. "I will not wash," you say, "I want the smell of your
shit on my face. I want to be close to you. I want to prove my love. And
your shit is sexy." You beg God to agree. Every night you go to sleep and
you think

miami is becoming you
miami is nude Susan Graham, her ass open above your waiting mouth
miami is the waters of the world
miami is drowning you

Dear Jeb Bush, you are a wonderful Governor and I hope to prove my love to 
you.

Love, Susan Graham

exercise of closure with the thing


writing with my eyes closed
 and writing very quickly and no regard
 and wonder: what is this thinking about sex that it appear
  in all these of these
   work, so that it is as if all there is to my 
    "work" is such sex such as it is, which is not what could be the case,
    or is it not? for there is not that sex within it, nor the violence,
    nor the lurid; there are just beneath the surface of scaffolding
     another scaffolding placed there to present unremitting desire, no,
     that is, philosophical thought
     nor would, perhaps it is not such?
     thought in which philosophy hold itself to the wall, it's not just
     one
        sex
        text
        after another, not that this bevy of Susan, Alan, Nikuko, and so
        many many others, I have seen them all, I have come back to tell
        thee, could not
        or would not exist, but that:
                writing very quickly with my eyes closed
                so I could focus on the philosophical nature of the
                   thing
                   which is the content, the thing and its proper name
                     thing and its structure
                     thing and its clarification as thing or entity
                     thing and its definition or linguistic relationship
                     to shifter and other forms of insertions
                       what constitutes the thing
                       what might be for example in this
                              or any other language, 
                              writing very quickly with the eyes closed
                                   so as to miss the thing
                                   so as to harbor or garner the thing
                                          so that the thing might appear
                                          in its form of expansion and
                                          compression
                                          which is the location of itself
                                          or within language 
                                               almost as if i were
                                               speaking the name
                                                      just as if i were
                                                      speaking the name

                                                               of the text

here we are, speaking on a street corner; we are speaking freely in the 
open and no one around us understands our language.

we are in a country with millions of inhabitants and almost know one here 
speaks our language.

we can talk freely about our terrorisms and assassinations because no one 
is listening who will understand us.

the chances that someone here will understand us is almost nil.

people are walking by us and looking at us and they do not understand that 
we are planning terrorisms and assassinations.

we are very safe with our language, speaking on this street corner; we 
are looking into the faces of ignorance, faces which will be utterly 
transformed with the passing of this evening, this night, this coming 
dawn.

we are looking at these people, while we are planning, and we are seeing 
the pasts of this country of millions, this country which will never be 
the same again.

no one understands that we, speaking in an unknown language, are 
responsible for their future in a completely irrevocable manner.

on this street corner, our plans are already coming to fruition, we are 
speaking calmly, we might be talking about anything at all.

estranger


On est toujours l'etranger de quelqu'un, " Tahar Ben Jelloun, Le racisme
explique a ma fille,
 one's always the other beside itself
 topple the little i
  (it's always chasing things)
  there's always a virus in the interior
    

    it has no idea of the interior
    it has no idea of the exterior
    it's there inhabiting a space called place


     the real strangers of the world , said Susan Graham, are those for
     whom there is no name, who are unaccountable

      unaccounted-for, uncountable
      toujours nameless, Archy!
		   
		   toujours nameless, Mehitabel!


		   always jumping back to what appears to be the real

		   unless one recognizes all addresses are indirect
		   according to the orders of information
		   which appear infinite so that there is exponential
		     proliferation, semantic spew continuing

		     from one heat death of the universe to the other


			  the best we have are pointers
			  that problematize the stability of ontology
			  as they seep across domains
			  eager to search, viral, numbers sliding
			   in the form of rogue epistemologies:

			   those who have no name, are unaccountable
			   are also among the disappeared

			   but further, without appearance
			   or the trail of presence

           the world jumps furiously
	   just when stability seems to be the order of the day
	     the order destabilizes
	     the thing which was named inhabits every utterance
	     our tongues are not our own
	     on the net there is no privacy
	     there is nothing to call our own, there are speed-lights
	     there are shape-ridings and forms, we leak onto each other
	     for a split second we are utterly alien to ourselves

	     look at our partners, look at the eyes of the dead
	     the abyss opens for more than Pascal

	     the cycloid "mentions" our loss

Date: Mon, 23 Jul 2001 01:29:15 -0400 (EDT) This is a very short interview
I did (as a member of the Alt-X e-books coming out) for DANAS,
http://www.danasnews.com/ -

 1) Writing has always been an activity performed in solitude. In your
opinion, is interactive writing possible at all?

Any sort of writing is possible. My own work is in solitude, even when I
am interacting with others, or with the machine itself. I'm most comfort-
able that way.

It also depends on what you mean by "interactive writing." If you mean
writing that is done in collaboration with other writers, that is one
thing; if you mean reading that is done in collaboration with a program or
hypertext, that is another. It's a mix.

 2) How does literature relate to hypertext? Will they devour one another,
or simply collaborate & corroborate?

Or perhaps neither; there is no answer to this, no absolutes. Painting
exists at the same time that installation exists. Cultural work is a
variety of practices. "simply" collaborate and corroborate - itself is a
disguise; in fact it may or may not be simple, and all cultural work
exists in a variety of discursive formations of course.

 3) Has something changed in the critical reception of your work since
your writing hit the information superhighway? Do you find the critical
reception of e-literature very different from print literature?

Yes, I have world-wide distribution, the chance to work with technological
catalysts, and the ability to find an audience that appreciates what I do;
this was much more difficult off-line. The critical reception of my work
has been much more positive - I think the kind of reading I ask for, is
optimized for online - ironically, it then becomes more acceptable off-
line as well.

 4) What's internet to you - a nightmare or utopia?

Again, I reject these dichotomies; it's neither; it's a confluence of
technologies, bandwidths, interfaces, cultures, languages, protocols,
communities, sexualities, etc. etc.

 5) Please share with us your personal experience of computer writing.

I'm not sure what you mean. My own work - I call it at times codework - is
often dependent upon Net applications in a wide variety of form. I've also
worked for decades in video, audio, film, and installation; all of these
practices interact with each other, interpenetrate - there's no "computer
writing" for me, but there are inscriptive technologies and practices that
I employ...

Elegy for Jean Paul, July 24, 3 p.m. 2001


Jean Paul, our crayfish, died today, after four and a half months. He was
doing well until we went away for ten days, and someone else took care of
the tank. When we returned he was lethargic, with part of the carapace
missing on one of his foreclaw joints. We thought he might be molting. He
also had the very tip of one of the claws missing. 

Before we left, he had climbed all over the tank, swimming over to the
nursery where he would troll near the top. After he returned, he only went
up the rock twice (he would launch himself from it), and seemed slowed up.
We worried about his aging. We also noticed a slight film on the tank, and
our house sitter told us that the temperature had gone above 86, even
with the air conditioning on. That's about the limit for crustaceans.

He began to curl his tail in - he breathed through the tail - and when he
was in his cup, his home, he no longer turned and faced outward, watching
the world. We worried he might be slowly suffocating from something.

He still allowed himself to be touched and was docile around us. He no
longer ate as much brine shrimp, and was slower scouring the bottom. He
would stumble around the plants, and seemed dazed a lot. We changed the
water and monitored it chemically, regulating the environment as best we
could. Ironically, we did a major water change last night, after which he
revived a bit, and walked around the tank, looking at everything, just not
as quickly as before.

This morning I was up until 8 a.m., video editing on the computer. I went
over to the tank and gave him, as well as the fish, a light early morning
feeding. He was still in his cup home, facing the wall; I thought he was
resting, breathing easily, with the new water. I went to sleep for a
while.

When I woke, I watched him slowly walk the tank, quietly looking at every-
thing. I thought this was a good sign, that I would see him once again
search out the environment with his apparent curiosity - I didn't realize
he was saying goodbye.

Later, a couple of hours later, Azure was over by the tank and cried out;
Jean Paul was upside-down in his cup, feeble, his antennae twitching once
or twice. We didn't know what to do; I began crying. I took out the cup
carefully, and righted him; some part of me wanted to believe he was
beginning to molt, that everything else was all right. Later, we were
certain he was dying, and, equally carefully returned his home to the
bottom; he died within it, his movements coming to a halt. The last we
could see was again slight movement of one of his antennae, which is
sensitive to scents; he knew he was once more in familiar surroundings, 
comfortable at the beginning and end.

There is something unutterably unspeakable in all of this, in the silence
accorded this animal, in our inability to hear his pain, but only read the
signs, however crudely, of his behavior. We have been literally at a loss;
my depressive nature will never leave me alone, and I cannot help but
think of the continuous and intensive suffering of the world, after first
plasma and before the final cold. It is as if the universe, for just a
moment, gathered itself into a shriek, and then fell silent, on the way
from boiling to ice.

Rest in Peace, Jean Paul

ironically jean-paul crayfish was buried today
 with a rock for a tombstone engraved by a french theorist
 jean-paul, it was in leslie's and tom's roof-top garden beneath the
 trellis
   there was a distinct emanation from the earth in which he was interned
   you could feel something crossing the borderline of perception, the
   slightest apprehension
    the apprehension was itself ghost-like, almost imperceptible as if you
    were about to feel something and then thought better of it
      a slight haze in the northwestern evening sky, there were
      thunderheads everywhere, the sky was waiting
        it did feel as if the sky reached down with an uncanny openness
        the sky and jean-paul spoke in an inchoate whisper, subaudible
          there was a lightening immediately above the stone as the
          emanation from the body of jean-paul rose around it, and
          gathered force again, immediately above it, in the form of 
          a cylinder or pillar of some sort of invisible and wraith-
          like spiritual substance
            tom chanted in a latin i did not understand but the words
            jean-paul were audible, as if in response to jean-paul's
            subvocalizations
              azure lowered the body into the grave prepared by us, along
              with the water surrounded him, as jean-paul was buried in
              his breathing and elemental world
                i took a series of photographs under the gloomy and
                unnatural sky, holding to the rich and deepening earth
                dampened colors muted within the membrane of the trellis
                  tom played the slow music of death and dirge, schrei-
                  opera and totenlieder, we silently drank a glass of
                  bulgarian white wine in silence
                     the sky trembled and waters flew, a moment in a
                     shattered universe, a universe utterly devoid of 
                     meaning
                       for a second we looked toward the other as if there
                       were no return


                       ::


(video)

my wife and i are traveling in a car and we are moving past many houses we
are looking around she is thinking i will show him my innermost thought
she imagines her cunt flickering with text pouring around it she imagines
my holes swollen my body floating almost submerged in text my very deepest
secret there is text everywhere suddenly we return to the street there we
are here we are her open cunt and running text she is being fingered oh
there is the street text stops everything is dark almost like depression
or the onslaught of war we fight against all others it gets darker cuts to
street to color bars making color accurate once again

Jean-Paul's epitaph:

"Rather than the eagle, the crawfish should be the symbol of the United
States. If you put an eagle on a rail road track and a train comes along,
what's that eagle going to do? He's going to fly, him. But you put a
crawfish on that railroad track and what's he going to do? He's going to
put up his claws to stop that train, him." (Dave Robicheaux's father)

- James Lee Burke, The Neon Rain, p. 137.
