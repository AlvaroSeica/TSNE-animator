Doubling ( The Fanning of Extreme Distances )





From Jean Duvignaud, Change at Shebika, Report from a North African 

Village:



In the South night does not fall, it comes up out of the earth, creeping

like a fog over the desert. A last remnant of day still lingers at the

hour of prayer, a prayer which she has not said for a long time and which

the others barely murmur. Nothing has much meaning at Shebika, now that

they have been told that everything must change, even if as yet the change

is invisible. People have no respect, any more, for tradition, that is

true. Marriages are haphazard affairs, holidays are celebrated with

indecent haste, hardly any money is given for the marabout of Sidi Sultan,

and the young people talk of nothing but the city. Yet nothing new has

happened. Everything goes on, but not the way it did before. 

  

There is very little doing these days at Shebika. Once upon a time, there

were the religious holidays, and the marriage rites, and even a tradition-

al way of working. Now the women stay in the courtyards, occasionally

dancing, and the men sleep on the square. They are waiting for they know

not what. The radio says they must wait, that everything is going to

change. Surely the voice from afar is not mistaken. 





From Rainer Maria Rilke, beginning of the fourth Duino Elegy (trans. 

Spender):



O trees of life, when will your winter come?

We're never single-minded, unperplexed,

like migratory birds. Outsript and late,

we suddenly thrust into the wind, and fall

into unfeeling ponds. We comprehend

flowering and fading simultaneously.

And somewhere lions still roam, all unaware,

in being magnificent, of any weakness.
