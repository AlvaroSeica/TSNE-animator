J---

Julu wanders Chiyo; it's night, there are dragonnes beyond
Ears of Buddha wings, there are sighs from jinja pond
You don't go beyond.
There are dark waves, valves, not fucking Hokusai sweet Hiroshige -
What gaijin know of art can't be placed on bamboo map
Or prefecture off it, the map where - how can I write mishap
Of Julu, what she found, crashed pottery - there was blood
Between the cracks (tan dust) from three thousand or more
Years of Jericho, but this was elsewhere, temple store,
Three squares for goods. She died. There were hoods
Down the street. They thought she was meat.
