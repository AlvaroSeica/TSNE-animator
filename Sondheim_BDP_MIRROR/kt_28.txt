then be such a demarcation between the real and the virtual, or from the
_current_ instantiation of the present, which is declared in the form of
an open parenthetical, (. One might define this as well as an arrow always
already opened to the yoU turned on its side. The side is necessary for
the instantiation of the _vector_ of the present, an extension. Every ex-
tension breathes the result of its subject and object. Breath reaches the
end of the line (here) (not here) and continues on the other, with the
accomplice of the other, then continues, falls off into that space known
