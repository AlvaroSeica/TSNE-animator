A Story Told to me that I have Taken on as my Own


One day I was at home and I received a call from Clara; it interrupted my
reverie, which had given me great pleasure for several hours. Clara talked
a little about herself, and asked how I was doing. I told her that I had
been looking at myself in the mirror, and speaking french, and, I paused,
watching the play of emotions across my face. Clara found it odd that I
used the preposition 'across,' as if there were an unsettled landscape in
the vicinity, a countryside with scoria and rills. She found it unsettling
that I would be capable of such extreme disassociation, even though my
schizophrenia was now controlled by vitamin therapy. As a theorist, I
discussed the mirror stage with her, or, rather, she thought it, without
saying a word to me. All of this happened to someone else.
