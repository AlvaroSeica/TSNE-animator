living in mediaspace 1 azure, foofwa, and i are living in media space. the
air is filled with electromagnetic discharge, cooling fans create a dis-
turbing hum, wires snake through the room, we're in the midst of the mach-
ine, the belly of it. living in mediaspace 2 there's no escape; the sound
and radiation continues through the night, matched only by the bleak sun-
rise and furnace roar, one toppling the other, the other toppling the one.
living in mediaspace 3 it's here we create our body movements, over and
over again, the irony of heavy labor in within the virtual, as we become
aware of big iron, even in the smallest appliance - of the need for clean
and proper protocols, as our body becomes increasingly filthy. living in
mediaspace 4 century-and-a-half old brick walls, wooden floors, skylight
and energy, wooden tables, several miles of tables, interoperability among
machines ranging from yesterday to forty years ago, analog and digital
regimes snaking into each other, patchcords and internal proprieties of
memory; we're here, turning knobs, pulling levers, plugging and unplugging
cords and cables, moving tripods, focusing cameras, aiming lights, speak-
ing, singing, walking, dancing, playing, theorizing, discussing, eating,
sleeping, excreting, shuddering, washing, dressing, typing, aligning, re-
aligning, transforming input to output, output to input, looping through
interruptions of storage media, replaying, rehearsing, recuperating. liv-
ing in mediaspace 5 my hands move across the six strings of the electric
guitar; they're not moving fast enough; when my fingers blur - then i know
something is working - something is laboring properly - the output roars
into being. living in mediaspace 6 intermittent taking of digital photo-
graphs through the obdurate regime of the real: everything returns to the
virtual; we're leaving our traces. living in mediaspace 7 thus tracing our
cords - where does this one or that one go - following the line snaking
among hundreds of others to the obverse side, interior, of the device or
patchbay: they go on with three switches half-buried among distribution
amplifiers and sync generators. living in mediaspace 8 the day is ready
when the machines are ready; some remain on, alert and vigilant through
the night; some sleep uneasily; some keep their clocks right on time. liv-
ing in mediaspace 9 we are sure to be activated; there's no uncertainty;
the bricks glow with data bombardment; we're becoming suffused; there's
not a moment to lose; the machines are waiting, tapes and disks running;
other storage media as well; there's always flash memory, wetware; the
room pulses to a single sync; you can almost hear us living in mediaspace
10; you can almost hear us breathing

now there we are in the background, huddled naked against the dancer, this
is very old-fashioned, dance and articulation, bodies and dreams of bod-
ies, media11 as i play old-fashioned shakuhachi living-bamboo, mirage sam-
pler, electric guitar, media12 against crashing shinto bell-gong sounds
earlier recorded, media13, working through a barrage of errors, computers
closing down after sound and videocards malfunction, removing the board
making matters worse, media14, trying different .mov compressions and set-
tling on sorenson 30-50 percent, putting aside temporarily the belkin usb
input device, media15, although first uploading a character-generated text
into a short video of wounding and sadness compressed like wap protocols,
media16, working with both hi8 v5000 taping with noise reduction and time
base correct, and dv all over, even with what's saved of jpegs on the zip
drive played back through the g4 which handles the sorenson beautifully,
media17, as usual i'm amazed at the labor involved in finding the right
usb or rca or digital or s cables, moving from one to another conversion,
usually ending, media18, at adobe premier, recording straight wording and
harmonica through the mirage, media19, more and more impedance problems,
how can all of this work together, media20, the videotoaster 4000 no long-
er with us and the 2000 giving out right here, just now, but the images
from the nikon 800 beautiful and tomorrow we'll set up the analog video
synthesizer again for vocal switching, media21, while i'll play back the
live mirage sound recorded on the sony professional cassette player, not
dat, but with good plugin powered mikes, through the onkyo deck, while 
azure and i are working naked, shaved, elsewhere, dreams reflecting off
bodies against brilliant difficult dance taken from nikuko parable texts
and the problematics, media22, of ballet

"43 yes a fingers and feet nightmare! your inscription finished, you have

43% completed defragmentation next to me. last night, too many cameras,
five, too few microphones, one, too many devices, perhaps ten including
the video analog synthesizer, too unprepared for embedding. :camera say

junction, all of us could feel incipient life growing, tumors in the
midst of analog pots struggling to control signal feedbacks, keeping the

we've finished fifteen pieces in three days. music sources include moog
and mirage, electric guitar and voice, shakuhachi and harmonica. video
processing includes adobe premier, an old titling program on an amiga, and
the analog video synthesizer. other media include the usual computer prog-
rams and everything's checked on the g4. shooting sites include a wildlife
refuge about two miles from here, as well as the interior of the loft.
other work produced includes about 45 digital photographs and a number of
texts. there are several strands to all of this - working with the nikuko
parables, working with a critique and sexualization of ballet, and working
through systems of signs and the body. for once the intensity has remained
through everything; we play back through premier, but also on cdrom, and
we're finding ourselves constantly astounded. the space and architecture
of the loft seem liquid, mobile; the movements and cameras are determining
the reading of worlds, not proscenia. the pieces are also fragmenting;
there may be several versions of each, and we don't choose between them
but keep them all.

burning them into cdroms which are write-once only gives them the perman-
ency of sculpture, of inert materiality, the grain of the planet. it's as
if we're there on-disk online re-enacting or recuperating the same move-
ments and the same firewalls against death, as ever; we're caught, to be
played backwards and forwards, repeatedly. you can see this in the seman-
tics of the work itself; one of the pieces is a parable scrolling in re-
verse, from top to bottom; through several loopings, the meaning, the time
of it all, become clear. last night i dreamed of my mother again, with the
same narratology - there is a traumatic interruption announcing her death,
that she is death; i wake somewhat later, almost in tears.  look at this,
this looping in wetware under constant mismanagement; it is inconstancy
which harbors memory, not the truth burned into microscopic tracks. it
takes the pure light of a laser to read them.

there seems to be a truth in nudity in all of this, something neither
machine nor inscription can touch. it's as if what's signified - the pre-
sentation of the naked sexualized body - converts only ikonically - that
is, through representation, into itself, looped through the viewer, who
completes the real. while foofwa is dancing, is a dancer, azure and myself
stumble or present differently, and the difference draws dancer and danc-
ing in; the fictivity of the dance is subverted by the labor and body of
the dancer, and everything reaches or lathers around or through the same
knot.

look at this, look at this, look at this.

Bridging


from Albert A. Bennett, The Interpolational Polynomial, in Bennett, Milne,
and Batement, Numerical Integration of Differential Equations, 1931.

"If, as often happens in engineering problems, a function is adequately
given by two separate simple algebraic formulas over adjoining parts of
the range, a single polynomial of low order may afford a poor method of
representing the situation even approximately. Thus if one is given the
table," [Which can be summarized: As x takes successive values from -5 to
5, y successively equals 0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,3,4,5.] "then, by the use of a
single polynomial, the value assigned to y at x = -6 is zero if one uses
only the data from x = -5 to x = 0 inclusive. Using all the given data,
however, one obtains y = 126 at x = -6. Similarly one obtains y = 798 at x
= -7. Similarly one has for x = 6 y by the polynomial the value 132. These
'unreasonable' values are not confined to the results of extrapolation.
The polynomial gives as the value of y at x = -4.5 the number -22. In
examples of this sort, the engineering practice of using an 'easement' or
'transition' curve or 'bridging formula' over a critical region without
regard to distant portions of the table is to be recommended for purposes
of graduation or subtablation, if the evidence seems to justify a smooth
graph. If a concentrated irregularity is to be preferred, interpolation
formulas should be applied to the two sides of the break separately,
ascending differences being used above the break, descending, below."

This very critical example is intimately tied to the bundling of heuris-
tics used in practice and salvaging natural law, described by Nancy Cart-
wright in How the Laws of Physics Lie. I often use the example of x =
0,1,2,3,4,... and y = 0 except for, say, x = 84927, when y = 1. This may
be the case on one hand with noise or random error; on the other, the
ratio is meaningful - generates meaning - in particle physics experiments.
(The whole phenomenology of meaning in relation to theory, organism, anom-
aly, and domain is at work here.)

Given the latitude of the real, in other words, meaning and interpretation
are found at the heart of facticity. Although this is clearly evident in
postmodernity studies, it's interesting to find it treated as a minor but
prevalent problem, circumscribed as 'bridging,' in 1931.

Think of it this way. There is no bridge, no gap; within the bridge or
gap, meaning is generated - and it is meaning which has generated (the
perception of) the bridge or gap as well. Resident in organsim, meaning is
the weighted, cathected, intended real. Think of it this way: the real as
shamed, smudged, spoiled - therein lies the boundary, culture and civil-
ization as well. The bridge as bridging transcendentals is problematic;
the bridge as meaning's interstice provides space and place for signifier
and signification.

It's the mouth. It's always the mouth.

living in mediaspace route 66


We already have a good perspective on the twentieth century. It was a cen-
tury of mechanized iron, of massive wars resulting from global imperiali-
sms. It was a century of burgeoning electrical, then electronic, communi-
cations, a century of entertainments and the fragmenting of grand narra-
tives - national and otherwise. It was a century of amazing scientific
progress, and the exploration of the farthest reaches of the earth. It was
a century of terrorisms and bombs, the century in which the population
crises and world-wide pollution appeared catastrophic for the first time

In mediaspace route 66 we are living tenth-alive tenth-virtual tenth-ava-
tar tenth-prosthetic tenth-bot tenth-inert tenth-transmitter tenth-recei-
ver tenth-sexual tenth-dead in eighth-inert eighth-physical eighth-real
eighth-abstracted eighth-virtual eighth-affective eighth-subaltern eighth-
imaginary space; in mediaspace route 66 we are living among worlds, within
worlds, in-between worlds, beneath worlds, above worlds, outside worlds;
in mediaspace route 66 we are traveling and remaining still; in mediaspace
route 66 we are through the wires and the wires through; in mediaspace
route 66 we are on the screen and in the screen and beyond the screen and
before the screen; in mediaspace route 66 we are within the hearing of the
same and the other, within the scent and touch of the same and the other,
within the sight and the sound of the same and the other, within the taste
of the same and the other; in mediaspace route 66 we are the virtual of
the other and the other of the virtual and we are the real of the other
and the other of the real; in mediaspace route 66 we are the virtual of
the real and the real of the other; in mediaspace route 66; in mediaspace

It was a century in which we began to grasp the foundations of physical
reality and the foundations of biological existence, and it was a century
of knots and the problematizing of closed classical systems of logics,
mathematics, and everything else. It was a century in which the idea of
space and lived and inhabited space became worrisome. It was a century of
images, the imaginary, and anguish

Report of a talk


I gave a talk to a few of McKenzie Wark's students and others and stumbled
through the entire thing, the result of no sleep and even for the first
time an inability to focus; I felt sick. But I did manage to talk about -
taking off from Anthony Wilden's work of a few decades ago - the radical
moment we live in, a moment in which the digital regime begins to replace
the analogical. I talked about, apologizing all the while for exhaustion,
the relation of the analogical to deep identity, identity all the way
down, and the digital in relation to skittered surface equivalences - and
the differences between the two. Equivalence has no original; entities are
defined by attributes and solely by attributes, as if what it does in any
particular case, any other within the regime does in any particular case.
But from identity, nothing can be determined... I spoke about tolerances
as well as facticity - a tree represented by a single pixel in relation to
another pixel representing a second tree, the pixels equivalent - and what
that says about the identity of the referent, if anything. Half falling
over, I briefly described Tarski's work on truth (it was Tarski who cri-
tiqued Spencer Brown's Laws of Form, which I discussed briefly afterwards)
- as well as truth both in terms of deep identity (bringing in Saul Krip-
ke's theory of rigid designators, natural kinds, and possible worlds), and
equivalences - skittered and situational truths requiring almost a Tertul-
lian to look for grounding in absurdity - the alternative being proto-fas-
cism. I spoke about mediaspace as well, a combination of analog and dig-
ital regimes of projections and introjections. I talked about language as
performativity, and the different phenomenologies of linux prompts on one
hand and microsoft windows systems on the other - areas of the screens de-
fined as potentials, closed source vs. open source software (appliance and
structural/configurable models), and using programs as catalysts for writ-
ing. Utterly exhausted and swimming in seminar space, I spoke about the
Book/Ends conference in Albany I had recently attended, and how the mourn-
ful attitude of the Derrideans towards the book was based on notions of
deep truth and identity; it was this identity regime that was becoming in-
creasingly problematized, as evident from intellectual property issues,
privacy issues, censorship issues, and so forth, online. I also talked
about the media people at the conference, and their feeling of exclusions
- as well as excitement over working and skittering across borders and
protocols, working towards planetary distribution systems. I talked about
how the media people talked a lot about protocols and techniques and shar-
ing these things, all of which are, like intensely situated truths, skit-
tered equivalences, interoperabilities in computer terms. So that it was
in a sense an entire older vision of the humanities, of human-ism, that
was at stake here. Almost entirely asleep, the outline from the pda so
blurred I couldn't read it, I spoke about translations of analog into dig-
ital and digital into analog, and the notions of generations in videotape
- analog lasting with 3/4" for example maybe five generations at the most,
while digital can last thousands, with intensely slow accumulations of
errors, since the potential well - the plateau of writing - was much high-
er than the level of random noise (very high signal to noise ratio). I
spoke as well about fluidity, and the influence Brossard, Irigaray, and
Kristeva have had on my work, and how on one hand one might consider flu-
idity as a fundamental characteristic of the internet, and, on the other,
there are also hackers and others who find the net a domain of potential
and totalized power, not fluid at all but penetrable, able to be violated,
controlled. Stumbling near the equipment table, I mumbled about gender on
internet relay chat, and some of Nikuko's activities there. Nearly sound
asleep and shaking with exhaustion by this point, I concluded by reading
two texts from the mediaspace series. After dinner with a few people, I
returned with Azure to the media center. Foofwa has already left on a bus
and we continue here, living in mediaspace 67, for a few more days. I
write, still shaking, into the night. Azure is asleep. I think about fun-
damental ontologies and their relationship to the analogical and identity
- which I also talked about, deep ontologies - and problematized epistem-
ologies of digital partial-domains always already undergoing reconnection
- always already surface and skittered. Tonight I'll read in bed again,
trying once more to make everything whole, or at least livable for anoth-
er day. Tomorrow, I'll send this out.

i will stop death by placing a tiny pebble in front of me
i will stop death's hard breathing by placing a small rock
i will stop death's approach by placing another stone
i will stop death's reading and writing by placing a boulder
a hill and a mountain, i will stop death in its tracks
a mountain and a planet, i will stop death's hard breathing

-

among them or before them all, azure, a wild reading
a wild breathing, swaying, you can't hear a thing
azure's screaming worlds, and words won't come
azure's screaming words, and worlds won't come

-

death, forestall us in the forest, hinder our uneasy ways
death, caress us against moving grids and cyclones, turn our images
turn our images away from ourselves, the world erupts in desire
desire burns through the world, death save us, protect us, caress us

-

in the forest, walking across the tiniest leaves
the motions of light delicately walking and exploring the interior
of a camera

-

92, azure walking in the forest, reading
93, azure reading in the forest, walking

103 living in Medeaspace 1 azure, foofwa, and i are living in Medea space.
the 104 line, the belly of it. living in Medeaspace 2 there's no escape;
the sound 105 living in Medeaspace 3 it's here we create our body move-
ments, over and 106 Medeaspace in 4 century-and-a-half old brick walls,
wooden floors, skylight 107 being in Medeaspace 5 my hands move across the

ces. living in Medeaspace 7 thus tracing our 110 amplifiers and sync gen-
erators. living in Medeaspace 8 the day is ready 111 living in Medeaspace
9 we are sure to be activated; there's no uncertainty; 112 room pulses to
a single sync; you can almost hear us living in Medeaspace, we will not
murder the children, turn them on, turn you on, turn them on, we will
murder our children, our texts

living in 122 imaginary space; in Medeaspace route 66 we are living among
worlds, within 123 in Medeaspace route 66 we are traveling and remaining
still; in Medeaspace 124 route 66 we are through the wires and the wires
through; in Medeaspace 125 before the screen; in Medeaspace route 66 we
are within the hearing 126 of the same and the other; in Medeaspace route
66 we are the virtual of 127 and the other of the real; in Medeaspace
route 66 we are the virtual of 128 the real and the real of the other; in
Medeaspace route 66; in Medeaspace 129 iism. I spoke about Medeaspace as
well, a combination of analog and 130 two texts from the Medeaspace ser-
ies. after dinner with a few people, 131 we continue here, living in Mede-
aspace 67, for a few more days, we will tear our skin to pieces, we will
tear our children, our texts, we will murder our children
