Forensic iii (form of awkward sonnet)


it's all broken down for you, isn't it,
teeth caught in someone else's head -
there's not skin enough for both of you
but only one of you is dead -
or can be which makes the difficult morrow
filled with your writing's useless sorrow -
what you say is always what you mean to say
because you're mean, because you think you're wed
to ghosts and emanations, wisps and avatars
who populate your dreams, have already fled -
you type alone, your theory's your bleak grave
you dig repeatedly, delineate the cave,
the dank earth, the excrement or broken word -
there's light for others, who are not interred.
