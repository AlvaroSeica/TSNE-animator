feeling ugly (I've never been able to look in a mirror - how can you do 
this, stare yourself, stare yourself down?
this space is protected from the world, there's no vision here
what we make of it
turning ourselves inside-out
it's impoverished, there's no money here, nothing for masquerade
but words you might or might not believe

later you'll be on the Net big-time in capitals, running the Web
and you won't have to look at anything all over again
just the seductions of someone else's visible world
it's always clamoring, links are hysterical

you'll skitter across surfaces, slide almost to the edge of the screen
you'll think you're big time
you'll think you've arrived
links seem to go all the way down, they slide almost to the edge
of just another screen, skittering across surfacing
while you'll think you've arrived big time

the lists offer nothing, there's no surface here
words you might have said, could have said, you're chattering them now
but you don't have to see my face, your face, anything
you don't have to see anything at all
as if:
the satisfaction is that of the person
which never has to be ourselves
the seduction is that of the person

links are hysterical
you think you're a done deal
feeling ugly, you're seduced
