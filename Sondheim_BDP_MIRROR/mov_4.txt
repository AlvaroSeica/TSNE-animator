nikuko your mouth is on fire . it's filled with wire 

it can't speak you're not a liar you burn dimensions 

fill in space and supplications churn plastic skin 

brushed angled strokes emanate spokes dissensions 

words are spire voice choir nothing moves composition 

forty-one held back from within under



your voice is a choirwho owns our local pi

nothing moves in composition forty-one                                      

you're held back from withininence than most of         

it's under your skin   

nikuko your mouth is on fireayhorses -  



it's filled with wireurrilous,            

it can't speak              

you're not a liar                 

you burn dimensions

you fill in space
