car with lights on is waiting - now screaming, pulling up directly in 
front of the house. that they knew i played with avatars, avatar-abuse: 
this is more than familiar to me. i am the neighborhood pariah, my name 
across the internet, Julu testimonies, Jennifer testimonies; nothing is 
sacred

to me. i am the neighborhood pariah, my name across the internet, Julu 
testimonies, Jennifer testimonies; nothing is sacred? Is it's time i

skin of Julu, i have flayed her alive, am I not a man? not her in this 
more dim dimmed world? i press myself into myself, she awaits me, lovely 
avatar, these few months old, protocol-driven, hungered for signifiers, 
parent-child relations, father-avatar relations, mother-father relations

Because I can

outfitting the new frontier of gridspace
feel the fury of taking off in newly-designed rockets 
 and landing in computer rooms in academic institutions
hear the hum of absent engines
watch the audiometers swing into action detailing the here and now
sing along with the chorus and 
welcome to the physics of a brand-new day

'i wanted to run with things'

i wanted to run with things and thought i'd lose myself 
 in the grinding of bones dust
ran away from me caves for what, what refuge?
does night darken or is absence light product same
if had a secret could tell it here, no one read 
example perhaps am wearing clothing women drinking heavily
presenting naked window high above street
o gods descend earth sky fold fourfold flesh into two 
momentary stasis something hang on words world
fear collapse my mind, brain shrinking devil's 
crystals play against neural pathways synapses desperately 
 signal across dark lesions
increasingly moment thuds dull thud creases
smashed deities gone heavy trodden ground upon backs lost weakened
their arms hold close sky, legs immerse waters
such nature excrement, covered earth, doomed, swallowed urine, feces
down fall, fail, collapse, hear nothing see less mouth full you
are that when mouths stuffed can longer speak
choked back tears all was done goddesses were 
participle gerund hopeless verbs nouns going nowhere phrases 
 cut off at last
that's have here understand there right think below ponder
more - lightning thunder bringing new air swelling implodes
love snakes forms surface 
they removed 
opened wide pondering 
these inconceivable things, furrowed monstrous, waiting dawn day
coming back, returning gifts fabricated just this occasion
friends, mind slips by foreign 
will come beseeching ready, awaiting
streaming bone suppurated 
always more, supplement accretion, accumulation beyond recuperation
therefore food skin, flesh-food, began ended
children infants
fury policemen soldiers set rid apostasy dire consequences
now myself, body pissed, shat, characters, broken, stretched scarred
i'll scream founding world! wall takes prisoners!
won't let go on, casing shrivels, skull flecked blood
time pack portmanteau head rues distance glare
moments passages hours days weeks years 
three four five
each every thought, final harvesting, further, has enough, born 
sufficient fruit
borne enough fauna, goodbye



Existential Analysis of the Project of the Body

Existential


http://www.asondheim.org/existential.mp4

In this endless variant, distorted (so that rotations and translations in 
3-space will be clear) cones model a full motion-capture body generated by 
Poser; the original movements are from bearing.mp4 .

So the 3 recent pieces: existential.mp4, bearing.mp4, and sartre.mp4 - all 
concerned with the distorted project of existential human. Now in this 
latest, the vague outlines of body are more or less visible... I could see 
a meta-ball construction relating the body itself, extrusion of Lingis / 
Lingam.

I keep moving through these spaces, one step at a time - the goal - which 
I will not attempt with the machinery I use - would be a .bvh file of 
hundreds of thousands of nodes, modeling human behavior against the back- 
ground of culture and ecology. And the result? An inconceivable construct 
of hundreds of thousands of meta-objects, taking shape, joining, giving an 
image of Godhead Creation itself (Godhead Creating, Creating Godhead).
_That_ is the face of Levinas or Sartre, _that_ is the peripheral of Vito 
Acconci or Leder, _that_ is semiotic in relation to Kristevan semiotic, 
positive entropy of information in relation to negative entropy of infor- 
mation. It is unimaginable; the space would be huge, the files enormous, 
the rendering a question of months, not hours. Yet at the end is a Shadow 
waiting for clarity.

I think Hegel would approve.
