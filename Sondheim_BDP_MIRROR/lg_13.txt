ILSS 2: "We are all screen-savers."


But it is all this way; we are all screen-savers in someone's machine, we
are all waiting for the User in Heaven to return to His or Her (I do not
know Who) Work, which is never done. And then we shall all die instantly -
without recourse - but also without pain, without processing of any kind -
without any foreknowledge or postknowledge, that much is clear. And so we
shall work up until the Lip of the Apocalyptic, when our User will once
again regain the controls, shift the Mouse or Space-Bar, and then our
world will disappear. But let it be known, there is no Responsibility
involved, no Response necessary, in any of our lives, in any of our deep
commitments; it is the way of this world and those that shall follow; we
are lucky enough to have these few moments to contemplate the Truth.

For it must be said: Life has no Inertia, no Momentum; it Is, just as
Mouse or Keyboard Are, and the There Is is imminent, within such a world
as we have, and no further. Transcendence is a neighborhood, always
already local, and we are lucky as well that we can garner some minimal
glimmer of understand among our fellow humans. (And we do speculate, who
knows, in fact, what nested ILSS may exist, to what greater Calling our
User is Himself or Herself embedded, what Other Users are there, within
which we are only one of many nested Levels?)

Thus there is no callousness in the Grander Scheme of things, of which we
have but limited knowledge; what is Real is coextensive, but with what, we
cannot say. And that, re: ILSS, within which we live, is the extent of It.
