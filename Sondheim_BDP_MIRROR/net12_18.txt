Although the I Ching and other permutation/oracular systems have been 

around for thousands of years, I wonder when binary encoding systems, 

i.e. the mapping of <a,b> upon the natural numbers, first came into 

existence. I am referring to more than an <on,off> set here, such as 

found in the Jacquard loom, but instead an _implicit recognition_ of 

binary mathematization, in which for example N -> <0,1>. This mapping 

involves several principles, not least of which is a concatenation of a 

string of symbols. The abacus comes to mind, but the 2/5 version of the 

Chinese or 4/1 version used in Japan plays itself out according to base

10 at the least. Napier's logarithms come to mind; these, I believe,

were originally to base ten; it must have occurred around the same time 

that other bases were equally feasible, and from that conclusion, the 

binary system would have evolved. Now Napier was born ten years earlier

than Francis Bacon (1560), and the latter has an interesting passage in 

his _Instauratio Magna,_ specifically The Dignity and Advancement of 

Learning, Book VI/1, in which he presents an account of a cipher "that we 

devised at Paris in our youth, and which has the highest perfection of a 

cipher - that of signifying _omnia per omnia_ (anything by everything)" 

... A footnote at this point explains "For this cipher is practicable in 

all things that are capable of two differences." The result is a charted 

"Biliteral Alphabet, _Consisting only of a and b changed, through five 

places, so as to represent all the letters of the common alphabet._" The 

system devised is precisely a binary encoding of the integers applied to 

the alphabet, with A = aaaaa, B = aaaab, C = aaaba, and so forth, until 

Z = babbb or 23. The respective strings are ordered according to a binary 

mapping. (Letters J and U are eliminated, and A is set, of course, equal 

to zero, if a = 0, b = 1.) In a footnote, Bacon also mentions Bishop 

Wilkin's "Secret and Swift Messenger," and Falconer's "Cryptomenysis 

Patefacta." He also discusses a secondary articulation or message, 

written in both roman and italic scripts, the former implying a, and the 

latter, b. Now what interests me about all of this is, first of all, a 

clear presentation of binary encoding, _omnia per omnia,_ and second, the 

relation of this encoding to encryption - in fact, the encoding is 

_generated_ by the desire for encryption or secrecy. And the latter 

extends to a totalization of the world, that is, _omnia._ So there are 

three things at work: the double, the code, and the all - and the triad 

is constructed within the guise of a _masquerade,_ but a masquerade that 

communicates. And if we take this further, to a consideration of cyber- 

space, we find that the triad has become manifest, not only within formal 

syntactics (double = <0,1>; code = protocol; _omnia_ = cyberspatiality), 

but also within the subject herself/himself (double = virtual and real 

embodiment, code = language, _omnia_ = cyberspace). The issue of secrecy 

and encryption, then, is "ancient," returning as a _generative process_ 

at the beginning of the twenty-first century. I wonder what other archae-

ocryptonic mappings exist in relation to this process; I wonder what forms

of habitus accompanied them.
