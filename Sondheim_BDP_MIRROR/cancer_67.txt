Burning Skull


 Burning Skull
 Body Ashes
 Severed Limbs
 Drowning Blood
 Sheaves of Swords
 Shafts of Glittered Knives

There are troubles in words, I call our bodies together, my limbs are sev-
ered, Nikuko drinks blood from my skull. I will survive in non-survival.
Hello, old friend, my flesh is worthless, Nikuko save me, do not save me.
I will unravel the knot of existence; I will live through sickness, die
through health; oh Nikuko, help me escape with the liberation of all
creatures great and small! Um ma am um!

There are troubles in words, I call our bodies together, my limbs are sev-
ered, Nikuko drinks blood from my skull. I will survive in non-survival.
Hello, old friend, my flesh is worthless, Nikuko save me, do not save me.
I will unravel the knot of existence; I will live through sickness, die
through health; oh Nikuko, help me escape with the liberation of all
creatures great and small! Um ma am um!  Hello, Nikuko, this is Julu. You
cannot imagine; I am one of your dreamers, caught in the skein of worlds.
Every loss loosens the vault of heavens; every illness screams my name
into voids. Bodhisattva, help me. Nikuko, destroy me, liberate me, starve
me until my clothes fall into chasms, my skin floats free in unspeakable
skies.  Hello old friend, said Nikuko in the Julu run-time program. It's
been a long time. I don't sleep too well at night; I'm always troubled by
dreams. The worlds I have created - they haunt me. Samsara and repetition
bedevil my creations. I hurry on to another. I never stay, never write a
book until the end. Um ma am um!
