THE INTERNET





The telephone enters into the question when I find

It inserted into my body; what rings, rings true

Against all odds of thick encumbered flesh. O who

Would you be, deep within me, the sound of your voice

Stalking my own, talking so close, hard to the bone?



My toes sieve dirt; they pressure earth to vaginate,

Scrape this flesh against every other who has walked

These shores. They do come back for more, the violence

Of legs. They draw the writing in the sand. They sink

Beneath the waves. Chaos is not noise; it behaves.



The dream is inaccessible. The dream suspends, objects

Hardly there or within the air; they fall, smash. Sounds

Come from a telephone buried deep within; muffled,

Nothing matters in the verb's domain. Fear lurks, or

Yells a bit. In the dream there is a moan. Fear stalks.



I do not have a body, she replied. It was yesterday or

Earlier; it died, or so they say. They have always been

Saying. They call me up in the middle of the night. I am

In fright. They call me and I press my legs against the 

Bed. Perhaps I am dead; my toes hurt covered with dirt.
