The Gully, Final Report


Tears smear dirt on our invisible faces where proper names are killed!
Other's breasts, mark ourselves all over, we feel the torn skin, our teeth
our eyes are torn by pebbles, granite occlusions, inclusions of crystal-
line tourmaline, constant tears smear dirt on our invisible faces where
proper names are killed, our dead words spike us in our throats our nip-
ples our holes, we're worms, we tunnel into the corpses, there are corpses
everywhere, this is the night of being human, what do you want from us,
leave us alone, Azure and I naked, smeared with each other and with black
earth, in the gully covered with roots, in the gully where dirt fills our
mouths and eyes, we can't see each other, we can hear them just above,
they're coming for us, we're fucking, you already know that, we bit each
other's breasts, mark ourselves all over, we feel the torn skin, our teeth
sinking into each other, there's no time, we're fucking, we can't talk,
broken fingers

hope and last fury
dead burns on skin sloughed against dirt
rope marks on necks arms cocks breasts legs

You're violated with shame!
Wait! Our eyes are torn by pebbles, granite occlusions, inclusions of
crystalline tourmaline, constant tears smear dirt on our invisible faces 
where proper names are killed and 25361 are fucked.

For 6 rubbled days, we have been buried
and it has taken you 4.967 minutes to speak your last ...
Crawl darkness broken fingers dirt-eaten through our eyes are torn by peb-
bles, granite occlusions, inclusions of crystalline tourmaline, constant
tears smear dirt on our invisible faces where proper names are killed!
