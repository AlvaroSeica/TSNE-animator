We're sending the wrong message to our children. We're saying "Hades
folds his dark wings around her" when we should be saying "May the earth
be light above you, the light be light above you, lady." And we're saying,
"I guarded this tower in life as well as death," when we should be saying
"When you go around the bend, Hail her, who died faithful."

We say, "It's best not to have been born, less better to return," when in
all likelihood we should say "I'm Philostrata, escaped from the bonds of
nature after fourteen years. I died a virgin, childless, unmarried; let
him who loves life grow as old as he desires." Why dream when it is better
in fact to say, "I'm Philostrata, dead a virgin at fourteen; let him who
loves me, cherish me forever."

Let him who cherishes Philostrata send a message to our children, that we
are our future; our children, our past - and that we have prayed to Orph-
eus, "She vanished like the wind." We're saying, "She vanished like the
wind," when we should say "Earth to earth," and "I, dust, am light upon
you..."
