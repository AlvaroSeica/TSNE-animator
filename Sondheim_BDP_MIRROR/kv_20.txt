Sonnet

"I've drained my Cup, until the moon
demands the needle, powder, paste;
Tonight we sup, as far too soon
We lose the semblance of our taste;

Our eyes which eat the imaged world,
Our ears which drink the air itself;
Our touch, which, Cup in hand, unfurled,
Replaces it upon the shelf;

Our mind which disappears in Light
Returning liquid, needles deep
Into desire's Flesh, a Blight,
While mouths devour, scream and weep;

For us, the whip of drug and tongues,
Of bruises, lacerated lungs."
