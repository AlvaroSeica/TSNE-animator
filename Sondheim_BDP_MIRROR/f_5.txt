{ Penrose presents four viewpoints relating thinking to computation:



" A. All thinking is computation; in particular, feelings of conscious 

awareness are evoked merely by the carrying out of appropriate computations.



" B. Awareness is a feature of the brain's physical action; and whereas any

physical action can be simulated computationally, computational simulation

cannot by itself evoke awareness.



" C. Appropriate physical action of the brain evokes awareness, but the 

physical action cannot even be properly simulated computationally.



" D. Awareness cannot be explained by physical, computational, or any 

other scientific terms."



Penrose's view, based on Godel, is that of C; I would hold to C as well, 

but on the basis of modeling restraints - i.e. unsolvabilities and quan- 

tum states within neural operations. Penrose holds with the latter, which 

he develops at length; for me, unsolvabilities and the very nature of 

randomness question the ability to model brain states. This isn't to say 

that _input-output_ couldn't be modeled, but that the internal states, 

and internal consciousness, would be necessarily different (neither 

better nor worse, nor more nor less developed). 



C is clearly unnecessary for any definition of artificial life, which at 

this point in its development, can be modeled by A. }
