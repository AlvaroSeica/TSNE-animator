On the way back the subway was filled with rocks. We walked along the
rocks along the tracks. We walked straight down the ruin turned left up
into the modern.

Alan was silent for Alan. He photographed the rocks in the tracks. There
were boulders and strongholds. He looked transparent. I was glad to be who
I was. I compared Alan to deconstruction-the-word, also performance per-
formative. That he was a force-enigma or marker-token that threw philoso-
phy back against the flesh. 

He said he'd worried the sexual all over. I said it's the way it was, ten-
dency towards procreation, juggled jugs. That it was picked on, picked up
on. He had one photo left. He'd hold on to it.

I did most talking. I did look good in my new frock. I wish someone had
shiny-shoes to see up all of me! Morose was so much sadness I could not
cope. 

But he said the rocks stopped the train. Dead in its tracks. He said the
earth was like that. The sex was like that. The sitting-down of it. He
said he was old and it was all heaviness-weight.

I did see those rocks in his camera. But I glowed this night and will go
forever I think. I have all the time in the world. I do have all of it.
