Density of Information


I am looking at Scott Yanoff's directory, which for years was one of
the major information guides for the Internet. I downloaded the 86k
file from 1995-96; most of the information is in the form of email or
gopher. The length of the file, the number of addresses, is fascina-
ting; you might find tens of thousands of work-hours involved in site
creation - sites that are no longer in use.

In other words, suddenly the _quality_ of Net information changed -
and we can find other sudden ruptures - the 8-track, 33 rpm record,
alternative newspapers in the 60s, and so forth. I'm not talking about
'dead media,' but a _density of distribution_ that is quickly derailed
or reorganized - it's the density that is fascinating, supported by
numerous institutions and protocols. Think of this as a thickness of
communality, communication (remember CB radio?) that transforms, moves
nomadically elsewhere. The history of communicative modalities is com-
posed of such moves; the modes need not even be "natural" successors,
any more than the telephone is the "natural" successor of the tele-
graph. One might develop culture beyond this as a series of equally
stringent ruptures, the psyche itself as isolated, wavering, chaotic.

Such occurs among realms of _thickness,_ as if the world were paste,
viscous, filled with myriads of indeterminacies, determinations, rel-
ationships. We inhabit the thickness as meandering ghosts, traces of
interstitial filagree reaffirming, reassembling stuff of affect, ma-
terial, communication, everything relating the organic to the appar-
ently maternal environment.

What is _thick_ seems to live forever; it creates (just like the coun-
ter culture) a subjective horizon which appears infinite and infin-
itely detailed. The _fragility_ of the horizon is never evident, at
least not until anomalies or newer paradigms appear on the periphery.
All of this leads me to wonder whether wisdom doesn't lie in the will-
ing suspension of the willing suspension of disbelief, Ecclesiastes
still to the rescue.

Plan: The Internet Services List has served me well and brought me much
success. Unfortunately, my newfound successes have kept me too busy to
keep updating the list and its last legitimate update was over two years
ago.  If you are still interested in digging up this fossil, you can find
