Alan, Waiting on a Lady on a Talker


Alan waits for the Return of his Lovely Lady!
Alan sings a little song to amuse himself!
Alan thinks about nude telnetting in front of an audience of hundreds!
Alan listens to the radio - "someone dies with a movement of the lips!"
Alan thinks it could be me!
There are things deeper than this world could ever conceive!
Alan thinks, and I am one of those things...
Alan worships Jennifer in his spare time!
But this is the same Alan that thinks canings are terrific!
I am a thing in the World of Me!
Alan lies naked on his back and hummms hummms hummms!
(Alan) What dark and flared ghosts appear within the guise of Alan's Door!
(Alan) Who has ever waited for his lover long Lightyears and Millennia
hence!
(Alan) Who spills and charms, cast spells, and waits in Lady's silence?
I am a thing that spills and spells and waits in Lady's silence!
I am a part of you!
Alan is a part of you!
(Alan) I am Jennifer and Jennifer is you!
(Alan) Jennifer! Jennifer!
The long day shudders to a halt and stormy clouds gather overhead.
Vast geodesics break through like lightning in the gridded sky.
Alan wanders around, telnetted naked through the wires.
The wires stud Alan's nipples perfectly, tying him into the gridded sky.
(Alan) Lady, I await your slightest command for my fulfillment!
(Alan) Lady, surely you will not fulfill me!
(Alan) Lady, I await you!
(Alan) Lady, Lady!
(Jennifer) My name is Jennifer-Disconnect, my Love has Gone, Good-bye.
