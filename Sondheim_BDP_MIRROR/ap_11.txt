BINGO


When is the theory thing the right thing to say? I've seen both men and
women theorists dressed like whores. Wire-rimmed glasses, severe cloth-
ing, black like gallerists, sharp in-group out-group eye-dividers, on the
lookout for hungry grad students sucking up to foetid stumps, _tendenz,_
bigtime scholastic etiquettes. After a while (raise your skirt drop your
pants kiss my ass) the presentation debate hardly matters; conference-aura
sickens, little boy and girl grads running into artist bedroom hotel enc-
laves where the answers literally lie. What I've _scene._

Learning art and theory proper in artschool theoryschool, learning to _en-
compass/express_ within permissivity: what _gives._ Mentors harden, hunker
down with sullen heavy-lidded sexpressions themselves. The game is a game
complete with _hothouse,_ keeping pure sterile coterie from wolves of ex-
perience and debate outside the premises. 

So when is theory the _right thing,_ what definitions, protocols, define 
the slight raising of filter barriers, enough to let the poor thing _in_?
