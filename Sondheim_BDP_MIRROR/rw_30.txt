- Chris Diasparra, tenor sax -
- Alan Sondheim, pipa-tuned electric guitar -

Really love audsax4 and audsax5, slower and
more moody/melodic and oddly comforting and
those riffs coming out of nowhere - audsax1
with fast underlying clean riffing against
beautiful tenor - audsax3 experiment with
overdriven electric, not so comfortable with
this - but the others truly interesting I
do believe - n-joi -



more or less explaining

trying to explain what i'm doing or thinking
about while slow-playing, about improvising
and where i'm taking the piece, where it is
taking me -


HASTAC Text revised:



Panel notes on plant and animal extinctions, revised:

Notes for a panel talk at the Hastac Conference in Toronto, at the end of 
April; my proposal was as follows -

"I'd like to do a full talk, dealing with What is to be Done, with issues
of animal and plant extinctions, with degrees of hopelessness, with the
mass Permian extinction, with images of escape in Second Life and
elsewhere, with the damnation of technophilia and Google Glasses. I would
talk from notes and project, not read a paper (I never write papers to
read), but could turn the notes in later of course. This is a theme I've
been harping on more and more - how to deal with absolute despair and the
despair of the absolute."

- This is where I'm at now; newer comments are in brackets. I'm taking on 
too much here; I feel that my view of the world is personally colored by 
the effects of ageism and its accompanying deinstitutionalization (a 
terrible word!). I hope this is still of interest, and that the comments 
make sense to you. And I particularly want to thank  the people who have 
taken time to reply to me; I'm glad there's still optimism out there!)
