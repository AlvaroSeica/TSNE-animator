Today I found Netguide from late 1993; there are only four WWW sites in
it. Below is a return from the original; this site, historic, is going
down. Note that the access is through telnet 23, using the standard port.
Go there...

                                            Welcome to the World-Wide Web
   If you reached this by telnet info.cern.ch please note info.cern.ch 
   will soon be disabled, and should be replaced by telnet.w3.org . Sorry
   for the annoyance. 
   
                              THE WORLD-WIDE WEB
                                       
   This is just one of many access points to the web, the universe of
   information available over networks. To follow references, just type
   the  number then hit the return (enter) key.
   
   The features you have by connecting to this telnet server are very
   primitive compared to the features you have when you run a W3 "client"
   program on your own computer.  If you possibly can, please pick up a
   client for your platform to reduce the load on this service and 
   experience the web in its full splendor.
   
   For more information, select by number:
   
      A list of available W3 client programs[1]
      
      Everything about the W3 project[2]
      
      Places to start exploring[3]
      
   Have fun!
