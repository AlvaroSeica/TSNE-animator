Parable


Izanagi and Nikuko were outside Lake Biwa, near the northern shore. They
passed by a grove of bamboo surrounding a stone, the whole delimited by a
shimenawa (i.e. rope, zig-zag paper, and cloth marking a sacred object or
area). The shimenawa was frayed, and appeared to extend for an enormous
distance; indeed, it circled the grove. Who is responsible for this, asked
Nikuko, it would take a man all year to keep it in good repair. They began
to walk the length, heading into the foothills as dusk fell. Before long,
they came across an ancient bamboo hut. A fire burned within, and a man
came out to greet them. He was carrying a magatama (i.e. curved jewel) and
a mirror. Where are we, asked Izanagi, we seem to have lost the path. The
man replied, you are always on the outside. Nikuko turned to Izanagi and
said, For the first time in my life I am afraid. At that moment, the
shimenawa disappeared, and the man returned to his hut. We are chanting
ourselves, said Nikuko, and they rested in the grove until dawn.
