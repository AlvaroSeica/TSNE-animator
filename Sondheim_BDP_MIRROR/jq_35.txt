"Historic" Fingers:


Here are some amazing finger sites; the first two I used extensively when
I was first on-line - they're still running:

finger quake@geophys.washington.edu (Current earthquake reports)

finger forecast@typhoon.atmos.colostate.edu (Storm forecasts etc.)

finger nasanews@space.mit.edu (Amazing complete NASA info on space
 station, etc.)

finger copi@oddjob.uchicago.edu (Everything including birthdays, moon
 phases, etc.)

With all of these you need to save to file, as in:

finger nasanews@space.mit.edu > space
