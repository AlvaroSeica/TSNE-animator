to do some writing you have a clear crystal
and it's made of glass, so it's crystal glass
you must make sure the edges are ground glass
so light melts in them and then as well
slight chips are imperfections greatly
desired as light comes pouring through

this makes the writing what it is and all
else falls against the edge of the mass
through which light passes through the mass
with images of disks and things to tell
of what had happened to it lately
something passing from me to you

writing comes pouring through the disk
like something passing through the disk
