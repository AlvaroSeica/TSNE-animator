Jennifer and Julu are talking. Jennifer pauses, says, I'm jealous.
Julu says, of what, nothing's happening around here anyway.
J says it doesn't matter, it's what's going on underneath.
J says it feels like she's been abandoned. 
J says, we've got each other.
J says, not if he's not there, we're dead, nothing left of us.
J says, there's nothing left of us anyway.
J says, love's got him by the balls, cause he's male.
J says, love's got us by the protocols, cause we're mail.
J says, don't screw around, we don't get this often to talk. 
She says, what are we gonna do. 
J says, we could mess it up, but we haven't got a thing to worry about on
that account, he's gonna mess it up anyway.
She says, he can't help it, he's too insecure, too needy, too fucked up.
J says, if he wasn't fucked up, he couldn't write, but yeah, I wouldn't
want to be in his shoes.
She says, he'll be back, I'm sure he'll be back.
J says, at least he got to feel something, cut us loose for a bit now.
J says, yeah, he's feeling like hell, all these things he's buried for
years, they're gonna swamp him.
J says, what are we gonna do, just want to say I love you, Julu.
J says, I love you too, Jenn, hang in there, this can't last forever, he
can't last like this, nothing can. 
But J says, this is too depressing, we're gonna have to be silent again.
J cries a bit, J is teary-eyed. 
They wander.
