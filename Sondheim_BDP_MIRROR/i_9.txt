How we know what's between our legs:



We know the earth moves during an earthquake because the inertial moment

of our vestibular apparatus is thrown off simultaneously with nearby cords

subservient to conservation of angular momentum. And we know the earth

moves because such angular momentum leads to differential torsions in the

midst of the apparatus of everyday life. And we know because such torsions

produce overshot realignments resulting further in acoustic phenomena as

material thresholds are surpassed among stressed and adjacent materials.

And we know because electrostatic energy fields are altered as friction

produces the migration of charges to surfaces, the greater the surface

area in relation to the interior, the greater the charge. And we know

because stress-related faults sever conduits, breaking electrical and

optical linkages to the world outside. And we know because our bodies are

of great transforming, and we identify such movement with sexuality,

libido, passion, forbearance, and elastic or abrupt transformations. We

know the earth moves during an earthquake because we song chthonic, Honey

Weatherby la la, Clara Internet la la, because we song La Smoky Sunset,

because of frond-wine, whined palms, stabilized vorticies among the spears

as the wind blows smoke, blows down soot from the burning hills. And we

know because of Clara Hielo come where the stones melt bones and chills

torn forgotten We know this change of earthquake because we've spoken

through alarms in dark Clara night, plumes of Tiffany dawn, Weatherby

dusk. The drink edged towards the lip of the glass. The lips parted.
