No, I don't go to church. Never did go to church. Preacher left me in the 

lurch. Never did go to church. Never did have no pie. Never did know my 

name. Sometimes I want to cry. The halt, the blind, the lame. No never 

did walk the line. Never did cross the stream. Never did straight the 

spine. Never did live the dream. Never did want want to die. Never did 

say Thy Name. Lived all my life a lie. Your sweet lips say my Name.
