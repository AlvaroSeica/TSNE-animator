two parts of _it_


the dark thinking of these space: what occurs among the words, one to
another; on real-time communication half-way around the world, packets
stutter, voices suddenly clarify themselves. the throat is always filled,
always hollowed out. no bodies present, the cloth, like the Shroud of
Turin, stands in for its absent. I sleep with two pillows, one for myself
and one for my absent lover; both are wrapped around me in a morning after
uneasy dreams. 

this isn't Peirce's sheet of assertion, a neutral plane or potential, upon
which inscription _occurs._ the letters, words, phrases, are activated; 
they activate bodies as well, stuttering through misspellings, the solici- 
tation of drives and desires.

the texts, sex texts, travel towards extremity where the body leaves all 
else behind; my simulacrum mouth filled with simulacrum piss, simulacrum 
nipples simulacrum bitten, distends and fissures the imaginary; something 
untoward emerges, a certain truth. this happens in all cases.

can text penetrate the body? yes, because were you here, _you would and 
will be_ and the text becomes contract, I will suck your breast, I would 
suck your breast, I suck your breast, silence with the act of it.

there is a covenant of darkness.
