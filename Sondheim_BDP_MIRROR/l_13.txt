The reworking of building #7811 on PMC:


defuge

worn out with defuge/refuge, exhausted, the isolated image of clit or
cock doesn't do it any longer, forgetting which body was which, which
located in the folds of which walls, which hole plugged me into my own

my mouth tongues my mouth through your hole through your door

dead language reporting on mouths unspeakable, swallowing urethral
fluids of introjected verbs

pouring out through locked doors of building "defuge"

liquid bodies remembering the exhausted image of cunt or fingers
grappling across their hole or moment when the locked door freezes
shut, rusts

everywhere inside, stains, bodies walking away, remissions, walking
the bodies away

say I hate this! I want to bring me back!
You exclaim, "I hate this! I want to bring me back!"
Alan spanks Alan's tush!
Spank! Spank! Spank! Ouch!
Alan exclaims, "Yowwwwwch!" as hand imprints appear on his tush!
Alan is crying!

oh please oh kind building
let me write you into existence in a new and brilliant way
this is the end of a day when all wastes away
parry the body, come to me, i hold out my arms to you
i tear out my arms from under me
@give arms beautiful building oh kind and beautiful building
i will slay the master mindflayer
i will love clara hielo internet
oh please kind building let her love me too!


Commentary: Clara Hielo Internet does not exist! She is my ideal woman! 
Someday I will meet her! I will be happy forever!
