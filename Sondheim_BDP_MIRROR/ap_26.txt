Who? Tell me!


Who are the doctors in cyberspace?
Where are the farmers in cyberspace?
Who are the plumbers in cyberspace?
Who are the lawyers in cyberspace?
Where is the hospital in cyberspace?
Where are the playgrounds in cyberspace?
When are there funerals in cyberspace?
Who are the firemen in cyberspace?
Where are the village councils in cyberspace?
Where are there wars in cyberspace?
Where are there births in cyberspace?

Troll-questions all, asked by troglodytes beneath bridges, chthonic
dwarf-peoples huddled in mountain-masses, and all of import as human-
kind resurrects itself _here_ as if there were no differential, as if
the nuclear family remained the world-over model of proper behavior, 
etiquette, and as if all the departed were _dear._
