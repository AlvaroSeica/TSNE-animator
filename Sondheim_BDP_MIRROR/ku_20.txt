Sliding


The original random language program I did, with the TI59 calculator, was
written with three different vocabularies: Icelandic Edda; Marxist Poli-
tical; and Sexual. The Julu program I wrote a couple of years ago in Perl
is being rewritten, from sexualized emanation to programming wetware.

In both examples, the underlying structures remain more or less the same.
And I want to make the case that this is also true of human knowledge -
that, for example, the structure of the Kabbalah and quark theory might
not be all that different - as words and resonances slide in reference,
across similar, if not equivalent, structures.

For me, this is one of the essential points of thinking, which is why I
love the Bourbaki, with their notion of mother-structures. It is also one
of the reasons I'm suspicious of reference in general; reference is guided
by structure, which it inhabits - the same structure inhabited by reason
itself.

I cannot resist knowledge; I can burrow in structures, write and rewrite
as if I were _wryting_ concepts and emanations and wetwares into exis-
tence. And that has always been the case, from the originary RNA/DNA and
their molecular forebears, through the ciphers of the I Ching, to the
/dev/null of Lyotard's Libidinal Economy, Jasper's Cipher, Sartre's
Nausee, Deleuze/Guattari's body-without-organs, not to mention the Kab-
balistic Emanations and Adam haKadmon.

What are the structures, that we may fulfill them? What is consciousness,
that inhabits the Same?
