poem

waiting against the wall, i crawled out from under sun;
his gun betrayed a single eye cocked in my direction.
it followed me. i walked still. i could never run
in the midst of constant insurrection. in such will,
war is made. the tracers followed me upon the sea; we
were all betrayed. the worlds' erasers turned the mill,
crushing bodies hurled and burned for liberty; we drank
the whole night through. our bodies stank. our rank
betrayed us. underground, the metals clawed, churned
up without a sound, ready to crank the war's spurned
death in the mound of spacers. bones broke, eyes sank
breathless in the muck of screams. life at the seams
couldn't give a fuck. with luck we came home lame.
