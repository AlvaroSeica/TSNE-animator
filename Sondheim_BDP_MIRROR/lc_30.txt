With the slightest increase in temperature, a packet is dropped off at a
site of my loved one. It waits, trembling, for others, all organized into
the coherency of beauty, "the harmony of chance and the good" (Simone
Weil). All together, in wonderful bewilderment, they form a whole, their
long and arduous journeys forgotten. How wonderful, my loved one exclaims,
that he has written a letter.

Under what circumstances can we speak for the other? Only in the face and
throes of death, under an alterity permanently limiting, incomprehensible.
Then we may speak, and speak for no one and anyone at all. There, at the
threshold, all speech is permitted; a black ocean laps at the base of the
cliff, its temperature at absolute zero.

I will wait forever from your message, from the community of the dead; I
will wait in your presence, a supplication of chains among chains. I am
lost in empty knowledge. Names are a bother; they shudder against the
pulverization of walls. 

Peeling, or turning away, the routers report errors; the reports never
reach you, an expanding shell of packets generated by others lost in the
absence of dreaming.
