cleaning up beauty

through transparent falsification

transparency = falsification-o-glorious-eye
the eye penetrates the thing which is revealed
 for what it is (is not)
transparency = eye-of-the-beholder
what is received = deceived
what is withdrawn = gone
we call it beauty or sublime because it tends
 towards spirit = tends towards dissolution
'you're transparent to me'
a trick = trip of the protocol
 = background-foreground proportional mix
what we call beauty is our very own = knot

dervish
less this is the conviction of the whirling dervish. But what there are 
I hesitate to take on the order of the dervish without due preparation.
