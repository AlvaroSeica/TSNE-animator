Where to begin when I began:

If I knew where I am, I'd have to know around my body, and then would know 
how that knowledge connects to everything. The best I can do is far less 
and I don't know where I am because of that. Where I am is disjointed from 
what I know. For example: I database on panix.com, Gmail, Facebook, Ning,
MySpace, Youtube, Twitter, Cybermind, Cyberculture, Wryting, Poetics, 
Nettime, Netbehaviour, Webartery, 7-11, and Second Life. Stop right now. 
This is the energy of another location. For example, then:

This is a dead end. I am scrawling nowhere. The appetition of the theore- 
tical collapses after any number of hours. Given the change in interface, 
I can't access .wsdl any more. The account is full of relics. For example:

$ perl a/looply.pl hello
404 Not Found at a/looply.pl line 32
$ pico a/looply.pl
= $google_search -> doGoogleSearch( $google_key, $query, !/usr/local/bin/- 
perl looply.pl typical Google Web API # Location of the GoogleSearch WSDL 
file my loop, retrieving 10 results at a time my $loops = 20;  
GoogleSearch.wsdl Hsearch = 1)*10; $offset += 2) { # Query Google my 
$results = $google_search -> doGoogleSearch( $google_key, $query, 2009...

which now crashlands, scratching nothing. There's this to say about the 
history: "1 ls 2 pico zz 3 fg 4 grep sondheim /etc/passwd >> zz 5 who | 
grep sondheim >> zz 6 w | grep sondheim >> zz 7 date >> zz 8 fg 9 pico zz

grep -v ":" yy > zz 27 pico zz 28 strings zz > ww 29 pico yy 30 sed 
's/\[.....//g' ww > zz," moving through the usual errors. Stumbling gets 
you where you thought you were going. I lie, cheat, kludge, hack, crack, 
stack. I can't remember the last time tendrils took root, for example /, 
with some sort of mastery.

Miasma: I have just read I misunderstand code (Silvestre, who I misunder- 
stand), that it's not writing in any sense of natural language. But from 
higher to lower level, there are always translations. Assembly language 
translates like sorted boxcars - the most beautiful emission in the cosmos 
is indirect addressing, tendrils. Machine language scratches the material 
itself: Better yet, scratch into the world, as if it were natural. Where 
am I in the midst of databases in this dark night? where is the night 
leading?

Code knows no night, no day. What affects the protocol shudders the chips 
themselves, dreaming the code shuffling through them. The code doesn't 
break; chips do. Chips shatter in the cold, sputter in the heat. 

This is my emission in the cosmos. This is on your screen, roiling across 
your machine, this doesn't stop for anything, this disappears. Our emis- 
sions are always already ghosts, always already virga, portending their 
extinctions in their very forms. Nothing reaches the ground that never 
existed. What you can be sure of: that labor, energy, created this text. 
That the text is an economy and a signature, just as paper money or check, 
just as stocks and protocols are economies and signatures. Under capital, 
mass amasses; identity lost remains in the form of energy spent. In the 
holographic universe, information is never lost, almost always is irre- 
trievable. Here in this text I give you the blueprint of my bones. You can 
do nothing with it. Stumbling gets you where you thought you were going, 
but you've already forgotten my name.

The song HERUKA

I MUST do this, while I have full CONTROL over my HANDS and FINGERS, while 
I am still alive. For this records a form of HYSTERIC MASTERY over an 
instrument, pushing sound to the LIMIT of my ABILITY. I have no doubt I 
can't go farther and I MUST construct this LEGACY of what ONCE I was 
capable of DOING. For soon I will no longer have this SHARP STRENGTH to 
continue, and EVERYTHING will be LOST FOREVER. Oh I must play my VERY BEST 
and my VERY FASTEST and as MOST ACCURATE as possible THIS VERY EVENING 
that will last FOREVER encapsulated in FILE #heruka.mp3. SOMEDAY you will 
listen and I will be LONG GONE and you will say to yourself HERE WAS A MAN 
or A WOMAN, gender need not be, HERE WAS A MAN AND A WOMAN, BEHOLD HIR 
WORKS. And you will have CAUSE to REJOICE at the SPLENDOR of the SOUND, 
produced by long-dead HANDS and FINGERS, that this SOUND still resounds 
among you. THEY KNEW, you will think, THEY KNEW, BACK THEN, and with such 
KNOWLEDGE were REPLETE. And you will be SORROWFUL you did not know me, 
SORROWFUL, you would not see, FOREVER, those HANDS AND FINGERS moving 
swiftly in EXALTED WAYS of SUBLIME AND ETERNAL BEAUTY. I give you, NOW, 
this GIFT, that you may cherish it FOREVER, silently murmuring my NAME, 
such as it is remembered, ALAN SONDHEIM, forgotten but HEARD for ONE LAST 
TIME, remembered for ONE LAST SONG.

Neuradynamia

Jennifer was dark and mysterious, well-strung, strong, and vigorous, but 
with weak nerves. Everyone talked about her and said she had a nervous 
condition. Julu would say 'she had some nerve,' as if a gloomy apportion- 
ment had consigned her to untoward misery. Naked, Jennifer exhibited a 
remarkable neuranagenesis, centered around the neurad. Pain were in order, 
Nikuko remarked. This is the central nervous system. This is where every- 
thing that happened to Jennifer, happened. Beyond railroad-spine, she had 
been diagnosed neurasthenic, an exhaustion of nerve force impaired by 
neuratrophy. Julu called her neure, as she said, from beginning to end. 
She reached the breaking-point, everyone getting on her nerves, playing 
them like an instrument; Nikuko called this neurectasis, nerve-stretching. 
There were no neuriatry for her, Julu said. It was hopeless. It's like 
this: Jennifer near death and they continue to talk. Jennifer no longer 
hears, has no desire to listen; her neuralgia peaks, her will to converse 
- her ability to converse - is gone. Neurogenesis failed. Her neuroblasts 
continued to develop enlarged neurocele, resulting in hardening of 
cellular walls. She had ascending neuritis as a result. She had descending 
neuritis as well, her virtual body dissolved into nodes treated by 
neurectomy, as one or another nerve corpuscle was decommissioned in the 
hope that her lipomatous neuritis would be susceptible to reassignment of 
addresses, direct and indirect, resulting in a cathected neurility in 
which thoughts and dreams flowed freely. Sheep's brain nervine did 
nothing, however; it was too general a treatment as the neuramebimeter 
clearly showed. There was no neurogeny; neuroma was feared, her neuroplasm 
weakened with bad thoughts that Julu had warned against. Injections of 
neurokeratin were tried. Jennifer the neuroid, screamed Jennifer. Giving 
name to neurography only lay the foundations for what Nikuko would call, 
Jennifer echoing her, the kind of neuromimesis that seemed to characterize 
her neurolysis. Such a weakening, Julu said, that dreams rose within the 
softness of her thinking, Jennifer thinking softly, Julu said. Neurosomes 
were softcode, weakcode, lassitude, languor, mute and supine reasoning. 
Neurosuture was tried prior to, post, neurosurgery; her neurophonia got in 
the way, resulting in transient neuroparalysis. Jennifer-dream-state 
slowly began to understand her neuropathic sleep. Almost comatose, Julu 
said, the result of neuro -trasis or -tripsy, as if the kernel were under 
siege, perhaps neurotabes, or the excessive power of neurosthenia. Dreams 
there, falling apart, memory tablature under the signature of neurotica - 
it was readable, Nikuko said, even from a distance. Even from a vast 
distance, Jennifer sinking, the incandescent sadness of neurotrophasthenia 
finally taking hold. Your smile is beautiful, Nikuko whispered. Your 
breasts are lovely, Julu murmured. Jennifer neurotic screamed Jennifer. 
Neurotropism negative and positive cradled her quietly, Jennifer sinking 
deeper, listening to everything and nothing, in the silent neurotension of 
Julu and Nikuko. She is caressing us, Julu cried softly. Everything was 
soft in the neuropathic, only Jennifer thinly dreaming, thinner and 
thinner, then nothing at all.

"I want to ask Jacques Derrida a question."

I want to ask Jacques Derrida a question.

It is question about death, not in particular his death.

But a question concerned with the aporia of death, not necessarily his 
own.

Such a question, which would have been possible several years ago, is no 
longer possible.

We are thrown back on the words of Jacques Derrida.

We are immured there.

It would have been simple: Jacques, here is what I want to know.

Do you have a minute of your time.

The body of Jacques Derrida still exists.

His body, phoric, carries the aporia.

The aporia is not his own, nor can he speak and return an unraveling.

Today, words are never set in stone, and questions go unanswered.

Today, questions disappear, and their occasion disappears.

The occasion of a question: a gap, as in a detective story.

As if the question were sutured by an answered, when in fact it is sutured 
by any reply at all.

An answer responds to a question; a reply responds to the occasion of a 
question.

I remember Jacques Derrida, and would have tapped him on the shoulder, 
saying, excuse me, but ...

There is an image I have of this tapping: the softness of his jacket, the 
slight giving away of the flesh beneath, and he turns towards me.

When I move my hands, everything is empty.

Jacques Derrida is a remnant of matter.

... "If death" ... "names the very irreplaceability of absolute 
singularity (no one can die in my place or in the place of the other), 
then all the _examples_ in the world can precisely illustrate this 
singularity. Everyone's death, the death of all those who can say 'my 
death,' is irreplaceable." ... (Derrida, Aporias)

When I move my hands: when my hands are moved for me, are only moved for 
me: mise en scene, a scenario or occurrence, chora.

I do not collapse time, Jacques, in order to speak to you: I speak to
you.

I do not collapse space, in order to speak: I touch you lightly on your 
shoulder, I wait until you turn around, your glance moves in my direction, 
momentarily you are caught up in my gaze, you hesitate whether or not to 
return your own, your reply to my question, you return such, as if such is 
returned, an exchange of gifts or misrecognition.

Of the good, there is the edge of a knife, and the fall which surrounds
it; of the spoken, there is a comprehension, empathetic alignment, then 
nothing.

Of the spoken, the knife edge separates the question I give to Jacques as 
a gift, an awakening, and the reply which shatters after a particular 
time, calculable, unattainable.

Of the question: all questions are a permanence: It is impossible to 
answer a question.

Jacques turns; I look at his shoes. Thinking of Van Gogh, of Heidegger, 
of Jacques Derrida, I take several photographs. They are remnants, indices 
with lost referents; they are abject. I am silent; I say nothing to him, 
to Van Gogh, to Heidegger. Repeatedly I raise the camera; eye-level, I aim 
downward, towards an incalculable earth. The images, lost, are digital; 
they never were. Between one pixel and another, a hole, precisely the 
width of death.

it is not that the signifier has no referent; in fact, everything has be- 
come referent, and the signifier slips from its moorings as well. it is 
not that the phallus is everywhere and dominant, but that lack occurs as a 
potential (direct or indirect) address within a circuit. it is not that 
gender is irrelevant; gender becomes everything, just as numerous langua- 
ges classify and subvert gender within nominal classifications. it is not 
that sexuality becomes plastic or manufactured, but that the video memb- 
rane become capable of excitation, arousal, and ORGASM.

no stuff..


Defuge sets in, a kind of nausea, too many files, too much, we'll give it 
a whirl, we'll see what comes up, we'll scrape the 'Internet Text,' any- 
thing else I've done..

grep -h "no stuff" texts/*.txt > zz
- No stuff!

Let's see - We'll try -
grep -h "no music" texts/*.txt >> zz

During day 2, the piano music was marked - slow, moody, in so many of the
perfect music) (there are no musicians, in the sense that there are no 

Not much for the texts from the past sixteen years..
What to do.. What to do.. I'm tired of music, tired of practice, 
most likely you're tired of listening to me (if you've bothered)..

Where's the good video in these parts.. taking a break, I know, I'll do..
Maybe no pictures?
grep -h "no pictures" texts/*.txt >> zz

A short time ago, there would have been no problem; Delphi and other 
predictive techniques, including computer extrapolations, presented a 
relatively coherent view of an emergent world. Now and for at least the 
next half-century, such extrapolations are locally relevant at best; no 
pictures, nothing is glimpsed beyond them. We are in the dark-age of 
fast-forward multiple (inter)connectivities that construct equally 
multiple topographies and worlds. It's no longer clear that what lives on 
the level of representation, does not live as well; artificial life is 
life of a form, decimated by pulling the plug. If artificial life is 
clearly the dynamics of information / processing, what removes us from 
this as construct: What remains obdurate in the world?

That's better - one long entry apparently without line-breaks in the 
original. And apparently nothing remains obdurate for long..

It's 2:17 in the afternoon: Do you know where your partners are? 
Maybe I make video with them? Definitely no video, let's see -
grep -h "no video" texts/*.txt >> zz

or the last empire, i forget the title - you know the one - the no video
stop? why is the NO VIDEO still going on? Why does it say no video really
runs when no video is turned on at all. These ghostlike apparitions are

Of course there's film in the last resort, but I haven't made film per se 
in years - no film! So -
grep -h "no film" texts/*.txt >> zz

Nothing! No film at all! Just as I expected! Let's try "no photo" -
grep -h "no photo" texts/*.txt >> zz

Nothing again! No photos, no  no photos, nothing.. 
Boredom arrives, no music.. Maybe I'll listen to something..
But then, perhaps no texts, everything gnawed out - beyond all reason -
grep -h "no text" texts/*.txt >> zz
