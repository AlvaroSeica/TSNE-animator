her dark places (earl of rochester)


thin panties without holes for breathing cocks
(tight against the shaft and open hole)
make landscape, slope and field - nothing blocks
the cotton white outlining the dark soul
of this white land; you might restrain the male,
keep him down and hard and self-inserted -
those spurted missiles turn to words and fail
the death of stories, climax blown and blurted.
goddess, make us women, shave us, grow our breasts,
spurt milk, let hardened shafts converted
into the depths of cunts from which the words shall crest;
let panties be the first and last of our inverted -
i wear your smoothness, blank order, your bequest
upon which dreams and poems are made, perverted.


JULU AND NIKUKO'S HUMBLE PRAYER (THEY HAVE WRITTEN IT TOGETHER)


THE THING ABOUT BEING-HUMAN IS RELIANCE ON THIS SMALL BAG OF FLESH, ITS
VORACIOUS NEED FOR FOOD, WATER, OXYGEN, SUNLIGHT, CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS,
TRACE-ELEMENTS IN THE ATMOSPHERE, OTHER GASES, GRAVITY, TIME FOR SLEEP,
SUFFICIENT NEARBY SUBSTANCES FOR HOME AND CLOTHING, SUFFICIENT COMMUNITY
FOR SUSTENANCE AND PROCREATION. THE BAG HUNGERS AND DEVOURS, MAKES BOUN-
DARIES, DOESN'T RECOGNIZE BOUNDARIES. THE BAG IS SO SMALL THAT A ROCK WILL
CRUSH IT, SO NEEDY THAT WATER WILL DROWN IT. THE BAG CAN'T REACH MORE THAN
A METER AWAY IN JUST ABOUT ANY DIRECTION, BUT IT HAS LEARNED TO EMPLOY
VECTORS. THE VECTORS UNDER ITS CONTROL ROAM THE EARTH AND SKIES, RETURNING
BOTH TO STATES OF ABSOLUTE CHAOS. THE THING ABOUT BEING-HUMAN IS THE MIND
AS WELL, BUT IT'S EASIER TO SERVICE THE MIND THROUGH MIND-CANDY THAN THE
BODY THROUGH VILE DESTRUCTION. LET THE MIND THINK WHAT IT WILL; GIVE IT
PICTURES OF THE DAMNED AND IT WILL BE CONTENT; SATISFY IT AND IT WILL
CEASE ITS YAMMERING; FEED IT ORGASM AND IT WILL SELF-ANNIHILATE. IN THE
MEANTIME, LET US BREAK THE VECTORS IN TWO; LET US CRUSH THEM UTTERLY. LET
THE BAGS ROAM THE EARTH NAKED AND WITHOUT THE POWERS OF SPEECH, LET US
BURN THEIR EYES AND EARS, LET US AMPUTATE THEIR POWERS OF MOBILITY, LET US
AMPUTATE OUR TONGUES AND GENERATIVE ORGANS AS WELL. LET US CEASE THIS PURE
RELIANCE ON THE NATURAL AND UNNATURAL WORLDS AROUND US; LET US TEND
TOWARDS PURITY BEFORE SLAUGHTER ITSELF BECOMES INCANDESCENT, WITHOUT CAUSE
OR REASON. LET US BE PURE; LET US YEARN FOR THE TRUTH OF BEAUTY AND THE
BEAUTY OF TRUTH. LET PURITY REIGN UPON THIS EARTH. LET THE BAGS CEASE. AND
LET US WORK TOWARDS THIS END NIGHT AND DAY, DAY AND NIGHT, UNTIL THE TWO
ARE ONE.
