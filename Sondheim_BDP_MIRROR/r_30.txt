*Tears came; nothing made sense as everything split. I felt hopeless. The
only thing missing was rage. Walking in the snow I thought to myself, I
alone am like this, and every one of my stories has another pulled behind
it like some sort of mad relay circuitry. I describe this poorly; I am
either half-dead or half-alive, and twilit, blind, I no longer tell the
difference.
