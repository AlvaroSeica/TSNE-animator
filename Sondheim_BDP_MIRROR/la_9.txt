The Link & That which is Dissolved (Broom Theory)


Azure! Azure!
You say, "I remember well I remember seeing you come from the plane"
You say, "& soon those memories flooding, that inert event, that signa-
ture"
Nikuko jumps into the past
You say, "foregone and forgiven, conclusion, and gone, unlinked"
You say, "small chains which are, which are broken & they do not clatter"
Nikuko jumps back into the future
You say, "& they do not clash, these disconnected permanent, their age"
You say, "& lost I do not know I do not feel what would be these age"
Nikuko jumps back into the past
Nikuko jumps back into the future
Azure! Azure!
Room: theory
The room is carpeted; windows open in every direction. Heptagonal, seven-
sided, with uneasy corners - a space for theory and discourse. There are
mountains in the distance. You are beside an ocean. You hear the waves.
Your every word is heard and answered here.
Azure! Azure!
Exits are:  portal
Nikuko looks around
Azure! Azure!
She is all alone here.
Azure! Azure!
