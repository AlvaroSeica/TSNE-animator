i kill a man


i see his face, it looms before me, i have cut into the throat, 
have borne the soul away, he is our enemy, he is evil -

he will kill many others, i alone will stop him - i remove his eyes,
they are deadly, they hate -

i stab his ears, he will no longer hear his plans have been approved,
his world is guns, i keep him in a box -

i keep the box in a box - there is no nourishment, no warmth of blanket, 
no drink, food, comforting bed - he is subject to my eternal fury - 
i will be his master, i will ride him to death, repeatedly to death -

just as he has ridden others, his violence knows no bounds, nothing about 
him speaks of any good -

he has stolen our land and our humanity, he robs everything good and pure 
in the world - he speaks in the name of his righteousness corrupt - i will 
rip out his tongue, tear out his teeth, i will eat the marrow of his brain 
- i will slaughter him and slaughter him -

this is a man, this is a perfection of man -
