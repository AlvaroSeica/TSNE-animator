Inversion, Decathecting (Jetlag plane notes)


Cybermind and fiction-of-philosophy as generators of real-life communities.
  look what we did in Perth, London, Chicago, NYC, meeting...
Surplus from those communities in the form of electronic communication.
  of course! the family projects and introjects
CMC becoming the aura of bodies, then, residue, footnotes, memos.
  the future, translucent life-forms-media 
Virtuality not an issue as email lists generate physical forms, conferences.
  the "virtual" already inscribed, abandoned

The intensity of the aura, internal and external:
Internal: The presence of Web pages, archives, face-to-face.
External: Private email, back-channel relationships, face-to-face.
Face-to-face internal: conferences, fleshmeets.
Face-to-face external: personal relationships.
   political economy of internal and external
   erection of firewalls, barriers
   increasing semblances of the body, codings, phonecalls, panties, semen

After the conference: the list becomes less a resource than a reminder.
   email list as continuous follow-ups
   lurking as audience participation

Does being _mean,_ does meaning _be,_ is being mean?
