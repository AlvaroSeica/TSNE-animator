Reporting on events cyberspatial, textual declivites in CMC, to friends in
real life, friends not on _my_ net, turns to impossibility - the shrug of
shoulders, slight embarrassment. Nothing appears sufficiently dense,
thickened, on-line; everything carries history fraught with nuance, dis-
course, turns-of-phrase. The worlds remain absolutely separate, and it is
with a sense of shame that I try to explain on-line to the off.

Off-line, I am currently ill with a fever, another insomniac night as well
in spite of double melatonin and playing computer pinball until I was
woozy. Community here off-line is nonexistent; I have to teach anyway, no
one to cover. My shame is doubled; the tiny on-line movements go nowhere,
are incomprehensible through the fever, and off-line isolation closes the
world down. The division's absolute, both sides filled with shame and non-
existence, but online the text is always pure. Always.

But online I could be anything, and off-line I bound by shivers. Last
night I sent pathetic SECRETMAIL; who off-line would understand the poetry
in older Unix, the stuttered admissions of psychosis under self-imposed
pressure? Everywhere shame, shame, shame, everywhere failure reinscribes
ontology in the presence of my face. This is the loser-impetus, when fever
renders online almost unreadable, difficult to ascribe.
