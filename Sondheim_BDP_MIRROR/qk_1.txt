new years 2010, let us hope for better

and the approach of the occidental new year's day. we continue to hear
distant sounds of vehicles, the christmas of 1925, the new year of 1926, 
distant sounds of vehicles, the christmas of 1925, the new year of 1926,
distant sounds of vehicles, the christmas of 1925, the new year of 1926, 
hangup (0:00:00) "can't be helped! it's a new year and teachers revolve!"
january, 1859, on the first day of the new year, willsey writes:
distant sounds of vehicles, the christmas of 1925, the new year of 1926, 
architecture for a new year:
architecture for a new year:
distant sounds of vehicles, the christmas of 1925, the new year of 1926, 

the distant sounds of the vehicles, as if there were something more, to 
the new-born world beyond the lanes of highways tremulously cut through
wilderness such as no man or woman had seen before.

it was as if cities of wilderness, great trees and thoroughfares, emerged
quietly through the hushed mists of distant waterfalls, where teachers 
revolve.

let us hope for a new year's architecture, tremulously gliding among
the soft loams and mosses of our memory, let us hope for pain's cessation, 
for a brief and murmuring time when worries disappear, so many waterfalls, 
so much beauty and wonder in the new-born world.

it is january, 1859, and, trembling, january 2010 is heard among the 
flares of distant trumpets.

silence, and being whispers, darkness, and being softly illuminates the
new-born world.


Radical Disconnectivity

I imagine a _radical disconnectivity_ characterizing the fundamental tenor 
of the cosmos; if one grants event horizons their proper epistemological 
status, this is where one ends up, literally. (Bell's theorem, EPR, has 
their limits.)

In which case, A and B have _no_ relation whatsoever, no communicative (or 
other) potential whatsoever. A simple symmetric operation, within which a 
chain might exist - for example, if A@B symbolizes this, then one might 
possibly have A@B but A-@C & C-@B: but this is mythology. Precisely 
because this is mythology, the disconnection is _radical_ and irreducible.

We have become increasingly deluded by models based on Indra's Net, or 
internets: skein- or membrane-models where every node conceivably reflects 
every other, and where every node is conceivably accessible from every 
other. Further, this models implies an organicity, an influence-machine or 
holism, a unification of effect, if not affect - something of comfort.

As thought experiment, one can imagine a radical disassociation with 
oneself, such that one is relegated to regions far beyond the panoptical, 
or optical for that _matter._ Here one is safe with one's regrets and 
errors; here, catatonia is the natural order of things. I say that the 
catatonic is the _natural_ order of things; I say that stillness and 
isolation are the basic elements of life - not Gaia and integration, but 
something unnamed characterized by _differentiation._ 

This is the natural state of humankind, the natural state of organism, 
which masquerades as network, not defect. Left to its own devices, human- 
ity continues with the radical disconnection of its home planet, a taking- 
apart beginning with children and watches, ending with slaughter and 
corroded memory. (This if the world is 'all that is the case,' its latch 
is broken, and what was within has been always already desecrated and 
stolen.)

(I will leave you with this, as if I were to leave myself.)
I will leave you with this, as if I were to leave myself.

last

it's not the last time i saw her was simply the last time she appeared to 
me, but more, that she disappeared into the buzzing information-laden, 
and entangled world, that no extrication was possible, that death 
consisted in multitudes of disappearances like these, the last flash of 
lightning or glass milk bottle, or earmuffs and shoveling in one's final 
blizzard - there are any number of examples, and as death approaches, the 
lasts increase in quantity, until the whole vast world is an inaudible 
chorus of lasts, an event horizon beyond which there is nothing to be 
heard, or remembered, or retained. our lives pare away at our lives with 
the incessant mumbling of the addicted, and we live in exhaustion holding 
the world at bay. always the supports give out, always the last confused 
sounds, sights and smells, always the last murmured word, but always the 
last.



you might have seen these somewhere

just found these hiding, from the avagasm series which was mainly
mp4s. at least i think they were hiding. are all those bodies the
same - really? s/he jumps about running through film frames in
unison. what's that about? i find my eyes wandering to what appear
to be genitals in rabid duplication. are they? why the color of
candy? edible?


fucking bad luck

for the third time our building got hit with a vehicle today
this time it was a van slamming into the front, smashing the first-
story wall, you can see daylight through it, another day in the fucking
neighborhood
goddamn the bastard driving the fucking useless van may he rot in hell
for the first time we're being fined for having scaffolding for two
years on the building
we're trying to repair the leaks which are the result of porous mortar
put in by a maverick company which cut corners
the building had to be shored up after being hit by a car
fuck the driver of the car may he rot in hell
the leaks can't be fixed, the whole wall leaks
we're broke and we don't want to take the scaffolding down and put it
up again
goddamn the city bastards and the corporate bastards who are out to 
get us
more people i know have no health insurance and health problems
goddamn the republicans and democrats who didn't pass the public option
i hope they die of painful diseases begging hospitals to take them in
without a cent in their pockets
just like my friend who died of cancer wallowing in his own shit
for that matter let's kill all the republicans and their concentration
camp followers
let's kill everyone
i want to kill everyone what's wrong with me
i want the rich to fucking suffer until they're screaming with pain
i don't give a shit about ideology, i just want them to fucking suffer
fucking religious bastards everywhere making life miserable for just
about everyone
i don't give a shit about analyzing our 'current condition'
fuck our 'current condition'
across the street ratner's finally building his huge stupid project
people i know were kicked out of their apartments because of eminent 
domain
goddamn motherfucker ratner i hope he rots in this life since there's 
no hell i hope he gets unnameable diseases and crawls to hospitals that
won't take him in but fine him for his scaffolding and run him over
repeatedly with an out-of-control van as the goddamn building wall 
falls down on top of him crushing his skull against the soon-to-be
homeless people he's making along with the big banks and their
fucking limos that cruise this areas looking for a lousy fix from
goddamn government usa, i hope ratner rots and his body gets eaten by 
rats that are all over our street, and they pluck his eyes out and
eat them too and then the rats can see what kind of a fucking world
we're making, last time i knew neighborhood boys were hammering them
to death with boards
i liked this place better when crack was around



now what

rendering exhaustion complete, labia
perform tropism, clustered molecular
channels woven from axiomatic under-
lain that fabric too popularly named
the grid, matrix, or other fanciful,
word on the verge of collapse, there
is no other, that's the problem. no really, there is no other, what on
earth stupid sloop, just shows what
tiredness brings, on when you least 
expect it



PLEASE COME!
