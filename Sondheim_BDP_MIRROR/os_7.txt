everything is filthy in nature
George Bataille is the filthiest of all
he has that Catholic aura loved by Lacan
they shared women together
a woman shared them or was it, no it wasn't
Sartre and Beauvoir, what a beautiful sight
Rita Heyworth the lady from Shanghai
could only speak something else when no one looked
everyone looked at Rita Heyworth, so what
does this have to do with filth? nothing except
what just about anything else "had to do with etc.
nothing's clean anywhere, not a speck in place
or rather specks on specks, what a spectacle!
nature's what is filthy, isn't it now?
circumlocute, circumscribe, oh well, just circle
that. nothing gets anywhere "in the business" 
but money flows deep in articulated streams.
but they're articulated with little or no bedrock,
nothing in terms of gravity, which has already 
become a contract between body and body.
it's this contract, Rita Heyworth, that brings
me to you, no, well, you don't think you have
relationships with filth, or haven't thought of
gold and silver screen. 

with Alzheimer's, Rita was neither clean or dirty.
or things things don't apply when worlds fade.
remember philosophy is made by healthy people,
no one else can understand or read.
