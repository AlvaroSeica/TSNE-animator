what happened:
half community, half theory list, cybermind struggles to get out of the 
huge mud that fop-l wallows in. it climbs to its clumsy feet, seeing 
fop-l in the air, ready for a fly-by shooting. cybermind falls heavily 
back into the muck, churning its thick four-toed feet into the ground, 
dull lidded eyes smacking of drugs too vile to mention. fop-l gains 
speed, stumbles in the currents, hits the earth with an eerie splash, far 
too close for comfort. they struggle. gape-mouthed cybermind's breath 
flushes hard and hot against fop-l's thinned skin bristling with nails; 
fop-l voice-piercings roar through cybermind's head and belly; both 
bellow, gullets half filled with stale waters, bones, flesh gnawed from 
their disheveled bodies. half-drowned, they shook the earth itself, no 
long leaps here, as cybermind and fop-l went under for the last time, 
rose to stragged feet, lumbered off in any direction but their own. the 
end.
