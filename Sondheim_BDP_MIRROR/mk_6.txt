she speaks:

sawgrass among periphyton, periphyton among sawgrass: who can untangle?
buried in algae, across almost certain rotifera, stentor, what is
innumerable?:the land is flat, liguus fasciatus a microcosm of rings,
desiccated alligator weed, the layers crawl across tamiami, they subdue
miami, tendrils across the river, down through lejeune, among the quarried
keys :i don't know how to do this. i don't know how to say this.::

she writes:

to speak is already not to know. claws and teeth mark the boundaries of
analysis. bladderwort surrounds nano-bio organelles. nothing is
complete.:desiccation of alligator holes, everything returning, supine,
writing from a distance - violation and distantiation of inscription :i
don't know how to do this. i don't know how to say this. the flat land
with its swells, innumerable regimens of meter-high mountains, organism
crawling through this body, through this flesh, the highs gauging nothing,
a bit of movement, neural networking, a bit of stasis, world shutting-down
::

she thinks:

cormorant nothing is complete. noting is complete. on a thin notebook.
through my to speak is already not to know. claws and teeth mark the
boundaries of analysis. bladderwort surrounds nano-bio organelles. nothing
is complete and right
