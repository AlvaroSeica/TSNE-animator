Among or Between the Lines


For some people, I would venture to say, their on-line sexual experiences
have been more intense than those off-line.

For some people, I believe, their on-line relationships appear more truth-
ful than otherwise.

I think that some people would find their on-line lives far more devastat-
ing than their off-line lives.

For some people, off-line and on-line lives intertwine, I might add, while
for others, they're compartmentalized.

For some people, CMC appears neutral, while for others, I'm sure, it's
fraught with difficulties.

I'm close to certain that there is always a risk involved, and my question
would be what risk, and what do you want to gain?

I'd like to believe that the answer is other, than for example factuals
and/or counter-factuals, although they keep the dynamics alive.

For some people, it seems to me, there appear to be real absences in their
lives which a fuzzy set of responses can address as prosthetics.

For some people, I've come to the conclusion, their words hang on their
qualifying clauses, legitimizing the I, through penetration.
