who am i i touch the sky i try and try i do not cry or wonder why caress
my thigh this by the by but live and die and we will fly and she did sigh
then took my lie and flew quite high above the sty and wheat and rye where
i would lie a real guy or apple pie as death came nigh as blood did dry as
flesh did fry the soul was sly 
who are you you touch the blue you stew and stew you do accrue and wonder
who or kiss me too this noon you knew i lived to do and now you flew and
she did sue then took my cue and lived to rue in cry and hue and rice and
few that sought the loo with real goo or sappy poo as death came slew as
blood from zoo fell fresh with dew your hole i'm jew
