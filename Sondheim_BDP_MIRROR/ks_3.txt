Some people maintain that these new dances are improper and immporal. To
prove their contention they point to the fact that these new dances have
been prohibited in many cities all over the world. In defense of the new
dances I will say that they are just as proper--in fact, some of them are
more so than our present-day Two Step or Waltz, which are universally 
accepted. The reason for their debarment is the position taken by the
dancers; so it can readily be seen that it is not the fault of the dance,
but of the dancer.
