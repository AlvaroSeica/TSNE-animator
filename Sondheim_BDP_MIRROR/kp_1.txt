Confessions


I pulled the second trigger at the Kennedy assassination. It was me got
Shorty. I violated those kids. Them heterosexuals were mutilated by me,
the ones in Panama. I didn't know but I had the gun. And I gave Mrs.
Kennedy cancer, the kind that killed her. I ran two against three at
Belmont but skimmed off the bottom and got to win place. Got my semen on
her fur but what was she doing on the IRT. I pulled the second trigger at
the Martin Luther King assassination. Now I got your attention, you got to
believe me. It was me who done Brinks. Maybe you don't think I'm serious.
See, I'm dead serious. I wrote kike in Lewiston on the school ground
there. It makes a difference with a kid. You can look a kid in the eye.
Kids are honest. Did some swastikas too. But I set the explosives in the
truck. I don't need to explicate, you know what truck I mean. Look, I
don't have anything personal against them. But I don't need to eh. Was me
raped that tourist in Orlando, she looked at me funny. I don't get orders
I give them. I got no truck with punks. They'd set deadeye on you without
thinking but no control. Like that time in Larrabee, one of them's still
looking for his mama, other don't say nothin or maybe can't. You can't
tell cause I look just like you. Maybe a kid can tell. Maybe a kid is
dead.
