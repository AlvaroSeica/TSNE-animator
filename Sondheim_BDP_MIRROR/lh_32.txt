Nikuko and Izanagi were walking down from Aso-san near the Sanjo shrine,
when they came to a gate in the road. It was of unusual construction,
tall, almost like a torii. It was hinged and barred with an image of the
sun in the center. Sun or moon, what's the difference, said Nikuko, this
is a machine for capturing goryo, spirits of the dead; they cycle in and
out of this world, flickering between the sun and moon. How does it work,
asked Izanagi. Nikuko replied, They mistake the sign for the thing itself
- they expect space, but are confronted with iron. They walked around the
gate, and continued down the steep road, the volcano fuming behind them.

*i.e. the kanji for ma, space, is a gate with a sun in the center; previ-
ously, a moon would do as well.
