on the project b e a m - m e - up:

Our understanding of space is changing for generations. In the digital age 
we use terms like Cyberspace, Globalization and World Wide Web, even 
though we have hardly understood the old electro-spaces like power supply 
systems, telephone and broadcasting. By means of audio-visual 
transportation we conquer new spaces, which present themselves as both 
picture space and space of action, place of signs and of real presences.

With the online project beam me up we invite artists and authors from 
different countries to concern themselves with space concepts in the form 
of art contributions and essays.
