Every death is different from every other. Death does not level;
each death is individual, inscribed - to such a degree that one
can hardly speak of death as a phenomenon - rather a collection
of interruptions. To each, his or her death, to each death, an
individual. "What part of 'duh' don't you understand" - more or
less from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. One can never say, he or she
has died - rather, that interruptions occur everywhere, and at
least once in each and every life. Beyond that, one must remain
silent, or agree to listen to stories, one after another, forever.
