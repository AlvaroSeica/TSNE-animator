Song from E. A. C.


Oh maiden, bind the stalks!
Aroo lay, aroo lay!
Oh maiden, the stalks will be bound!
Aloor, aroo lay, aroo lay!

Oh youngman, carry the sheaves!
Aroo lay, aroo lay!
Oh youngman, the sheaves will be carried!
Aloor, aroo lay, aroo lay!

Oh maiden, unbind the stalks!
Aroo lay, aroo lay!
Oh maiden, the stalks are unbound!
Aloor, aroo lay, aroo lay!

Oh youngman, assemble the sheaves!
Aroo lay, aroo lay!
Oh youngman, the sheaves are assembled!
Aloor, aroo lay, aroo lay!

Oh maiden, the sheaves and the stalks!
Aroo lay, aroo lay!
Oh youngman, the stalks and the sheaves!
Aloor, aroo lay, aroo lay!
