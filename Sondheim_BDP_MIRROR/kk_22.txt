Nikuko - why this? Why would uid 99 do such a thing? Nobody came into the
machine, nobody left it?

Jun 27 03:47:34 166 PAM_pwdb[276]: (login) session closed for user root
Jun 27 03:47:37 166 PAM_pwdb[640]: (login) session opened for user root by

Jun 27 03:47:37 166 login[640]: ROOT LOGIN ON tty1

(uid=99)
Jun 27 04:02:41 166 PAM_pwdb[769]: (su) session closed for user nobody
(END)

Look now, "nobody:*:99:99:Nobody:/:"

Nobody's got a passwd. Here's the passwd of Daishin Nikuko! --

"nikuko:JRaNS9yL2HLGo:500:500::/home/nikuko:/bin/bash"

There you are! Nobody under user id 99 comes to visit, leaves again.
If I, root, let you, you could be nobody too!

Jennifer points out that Emily Dickinson was nobody, "I'm nobody," etc.
Emily Dickinson was on linux. Emily was the first on the Net, the
first to be netted.

At which point #280 ends. Emily, our first avatar, says Jennifer.
