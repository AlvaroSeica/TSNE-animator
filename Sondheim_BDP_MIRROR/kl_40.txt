De Man Heidegger and Lovely Celine


"what they wrote, or didn't write, about the war
at one time, meaning and a motivation
the dim grapple, blunted hook and circulation
of beard and book and object, always a roar
of Truth about their writing
they'd thought they'd go down fighting
through clear delineations of a mausoleum door
they'd see 'from out of into' the scum
then there was clarity and deaf ambition
by now and later also blind attrition
writing contaminated by its source
beat a dead horse in your condition"

(Wilfred Owen)


To which I might reply:

Celine is a special case, Jewish Gravel Standing Upright on the Peninsula
De Man another, for who would want the Inability to Change a Mind
Before the Patriarch, Denial of Title
 For I, Daishin Nikuko, insist that Roots atrophy,
 The Inexorable Grinding of Wrong Opinion
 Before the Castle of Chastity shall Lose its Way across the Straightest
  Moat
Dear Heidegger, Let us Read what is Written, Remembering but Losing
 At times the Thread across This Way
 For the Thread is a Thread to be sure,
 And sometimes Knowledge is Grounded in Letting-Go

The Hardest Lesson of All is that
 Not everything is Reflected in everything else
 There are Things Cut off, Cauterized
A Reading is Always a Beginning to take and Give simultaneously
 Across the Moat towards the Castle of Fortitude
 Which is not Always Right, but has proper Reading Lamps

I shall not Strain my I's.

I shall Cut myself Off in the Wilderness
I shall Howl Like a Beast that Longs to Open and Run
I shall Wear Gravel
I shall Cease Reading
           Gain Certain Knowledge
               Forget What I have Gained

"For the Thread to be Sure is a Thread
And Knowledge is sometimes Grounded in Letting-go"
