The horror or ghoul, the torn female ghost

I was desperate to become someone else in Japan, "said Nikuko," and you
came from there; I was desperate to become someone else in Japan, "said
Alan," and you were there, you were there that I was to become a carrier.
I carried you back here with me, "said" Nikuko, along with all your be-
longings, your mementos which strive to insert themselves into the punc-
tum of your history, that this really happened, that you are different.
"You are no different, said" Alan, than the collocation of mementos, now
fiercely mark my body with them. Marking Alan's body, Alan's painful de-
gree into a millimeter, Nikuko "said, not" deep enough. Incisions, inser-
ting mementos. Her body a canvas of becoming someone else. Mementos grew
roots, fascinations, fastened on bones, organs, synaptic columns. Never
deep enough, "Nikuko" said, I am still "Nikuko," said Alan. Disappearance
never worked, Nikuko sentenced to the sentence, Alan "sentenced to life."
