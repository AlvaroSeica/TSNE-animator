notice:

postmodernism is an act not a theory
consider the opposites fragments or alternatives
sullied revolutions
there's nothing to believe in any more
burning down the house
there aren't any homes online or offline
we're all packets stuttered and starving in mausoleums
silencing of women, arming of children
arming of children, silencing of men
no one grows up any more, wa wa wa
cutting through selves and others in blind fury
 there's a subcategory
 cutting through selves and others in pure calculation
coldness of steel and steel grips in big and little hands
look at creatures everywhere, there's no species anymore
postmodernism kills
we're the theory of the killers
ipseity, we're that
