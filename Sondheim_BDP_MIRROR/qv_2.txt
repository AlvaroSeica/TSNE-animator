recording today 8-10 hours (saturday)

virtuosity is useless today.
we're all player pianos.
my instruments go out of tune with the slightest change of humidity or 
temperature.
my instruments go out of style.
there's nothing electric running in them except for electroweak forces.
their molecules might be anywhere.
their history might be anywhere.
i practice and practice an utterly useless art.
i can't dial in scales or cents; i have to run with the flow.
my fingers search, endlessly, for perfect consonance or dissonance.
everything is dissonance; perfect consonance is impossible.
welcome to the world of catastrophic balance.
my fingers pay no attention, tightening and loosening wires.
this doesn't come easy; it comes with several hours lost in the day.
these are lost hours; they do nothing for me.
for you at best they retain a sense of the antiquarian.
one second of nikuko, julu, or jennifer is worth more than weeks of 
hand-played musical noise.
right now the instruments are precariously balanced on the stairs.
they're waiting for the trip to the recording studio.
it's cold out and they'll go out of tune on the way.
they're uselessly demanding.
there's nothing to do but heed them.
i'll be the worst last virtuoso, wait and see.

(sunday)

we completed 2.9 hours of final work, 29 pieces, not that many.
i played electric saz, acoustic-electric oud, solid-body oud, violin, 
viola, chromatic harmonica, classical guitar, acoustic-electric guitar, 
ukulele, cura cumbus, ghuzeng, alpine zither, and pipa. helena played 3/4 
size cello throughout, azure sang 12 songs. we began at 11 am and ended at 
9 pm. joel was our engineer. everything was duet with helena, most often 
trio with azure, with one solo classical guitar piece. joel loaned me his 
erhu, perhaps for next time. the studio was warm and my fingers are fine, 
a surprise, even the nails are ok. the acoustic- electric oud began wildly 
out of tune; the d-string on the pipa kept slipping (so i ended one piece 
avoiding it). we'll have one vinyl from firemuseum, and possible another 
recording from yet another company. i'm leaving a loose trail of finger 
motions behind. when i'm dead there'll be this record. music is my avatar, 
my useless useless avatar.

after (going against the muscle-fed grain)


thinking through the phenomenology of bowing,
going against my worst instincts
arm swinging uh-oh back and forth
coming and going something else emerging
so far out of control! 
so there bumping and grinding!
yay yay yay!

music, baryon


when i play an instrument, a current runs through me.
now this is the aporia: it appears to be the strong force.
the strong force on the level of quarks and gluons you understand.
as if i were playing the field currents and their probabilities.
it's hard to escape the most popular feynman diagrams.
i push against the grain having no idea what might emerge.
no wonder einstein's dice-playing god had the singular die.

i play the strings vertically, not horizontally. i remain on a string.
i remain on a string and others appear as helpmates catalysts.
additional energy drives the overtones.
jumping strings is an admission of defeat.

i am the server-surveyor-surgeon of my participation. in a world
in a world of my own making in dialog with a world.
i am dead and my dialog is a dead dialog in dialog with a dead world.

in survery-surgery i speed up my files beyond recognition.
and every notes contacts every other.
you can hear the harpies screaming as the world shudders.
which world, oh this one or that one.
the world does not shudder to a halt, the world spreads and splays.

in this spread world the strings are the particles of objects.
the so resilient strings draw nothing but erupt the true-real landscape.
vibration modes produce objects buried in data-base phenomenology.
nothing exhausts nothing in this true-real world.

there is no music in this true real world. there is no sound.
i bring sound from elsewhere. the screaming harpies arrive.
they arrive from somewhere else, wayward and untoward ontology.
they give substance to display, grit to projection, dirt to platonism.

this number is not this number, it is dirt.
dirt gives matter to this number.
dirt is the suture of this number to dirt.
what seems like a film is an ontology and a philosophy.
what seems like a landscape is a psychology and ruined ideality.

i press against the violin fingerboard. i leave dna behind.
dirt dna, fingerprints, oils, bacteria, prions, viruses, and cells.
what you hear struggles to get heard.
what you see is dead when you are dead. you are dead here and now.
this is called the 'instant.'
but a current runs through it. 
and through this current i am sure it is the strong force.
and i begin the count of baryons.
i begin the baryon count.

slvoice

1-4 closely played tones on single strings with adjacent harmonics
etc. - each slvoice a different string. 5 combination with similar
figures played up the fingerboard.

coming from a dreamscape of second life sounds from just outside the 
virtual, just there, almost adjacent, what would be heard within the 
friction/frisson of worlds.

these are rather different than my other solo violin pieces, perhaps
just as miserable but with a fair accounting and virtual presence...

rotations stopped for a while (between then and now)
started again, here we go
the register's too high, speed too great
you can just barely make out the phrase

alone with the violin, i feel i can do nothing
alone with the violin, i feel i can do anything

it's the emptiness that first appears, and then the dawn,
bristling with knives and dancers

no room at the inn

video and stills
opensim overburdened installation removed for the most part
  to the interior of the mountain
there it remains invisible, sometimes you find a glimpse
julu twine cannot find hirself a resting spot, s,he begs
all the nice spots are within the mountain next to the sea

it takes a long time to create absence
it takes a long time to make the proper gloom
hir flight is all that remains, s,he fails and so close
the mountain is full of energy, the proton won't decay

there is no room at the inn

there is no room at the inn
there is no manger
the wise men arrive nowhere
being wise, they're poor, bearing no gifts
in the manger, animals
in the sky, a slight overcast and waning moon
no one said anything to anyone
children were born all the time, and most didn't live
most died in childhood and most died in poverty
in rome, noise and scuttling about the amphitheater
in rome, the time was earlier, maybe an hour or so
there was no cross anywhere between rome and anywhere
there was no crime and no thieves
everyone spoke well and many spoke to many others
vertical and everlasting subjects, from gods to grounds
everyone listening politely and it began to rain
it rained lightly and people talked about the weather
here and there, wine and bread were passed out
someone knew something about a party
animals murmured as the night grew darker
a woman stepped into the shadows
people were just so tired and the air was cool

one comment 'pretty strange'


inside the mountain

the meerkat viewer allows camera views of the landscape interiors.
we journeyed through the mountain and julu twine remained outside.
we commanded hir to sit on the objects inside the mountain.
julu twine cannot move through the rocky mesh and is jounced.
jouncing takes the avatar to the sea bottom and the video ends.
following then are stills of julu twine outside, objects within.
julu twine cannot see the objects but you can.
you can see the objects and julu twine together.
more phenomenology of virtual worlds to which i am dedicated.
it's as if i present to you all the conceivable anomalies.
look it's as if i am saying i'm smarter than the avatar.
it's as if i am saying what a tangled mesh we weave.

two virtual danceworks

two work of dance with Sandy Baldwin assembled from the archive.
I love these - the music of Sandy's texts, the convoluted movements;
I've been waiting to assemble them into a full video, but this is
excellent in itself. Gathared presents a gathered goatherd variety;
gothard (which should be gathared inn content?) is a beautiful
environmental shuddering. Enjoy!

May 2011 E-Poetry Presentation precis (Buffalo, NY)

I will talk about the fluid semiotics of virtual world productions, in 
terms of Kristevan semiosis and fluid logics governing both avatar and 
object behaviors through scriptings and 'signage' embedded in scripts or 
within the visible local and fluid landscape itself. I will relate all of 
this to the future of human/organic society on the planet, with or without 
the Internet, and I will do this in fifteen minutes. I would like audio- 
video output for laptop, but will not need online connectivity.

Theses:

1. Culture is always already virtual.
2. Culture is always already abject and inscriptive.
3. Abjection and inscription are entangled, irresolute, corroding both 
truth functions and definitions.
4. Culture is all the way down; every organism is a priori cultural.
5. Culture is intimately related to alterity.
6. Virtual worlds permit logical, physical, organic, sexual, linguistic, 
and psychological flows, without fundamental basis.
7. Virtual worlds are the future of the exploration of inscription, 
culture, and the imaginary.
8. A parabola leads from virtual worlds to the true-real physical world, 
which is already produced, itself as virtual.
9. Physics is the structure of the true-real physical world.
10. The appetition of physical returns us to thesis 1.


Monsoon, Neutron

solo violin; if you're short of time I'd listen as follows:
monsoon3, monsoon2, monsoon4, monsoon1
these are definitely a breakthrough, how? why?
reading George Antheil's Bad Boy of Music,
and reading Hedy Lamarr's Ecstasy and Me, 
and thinking about solo violin and its difficulty and then,
in this case, suddenly the turmoil organizes itself, 
as if the solo neutron held together, looked around! - 
i had just a moment in its roughly eleven minute half-life,
creating these, perhaps close to the total,
perhaps a bit over, but definitely the neutron!
READY TO DESTROY ITSELF AS CHARACTER!
WONDERS EMERGE!

I was thinking what would be so and turned dizzy in the process.

and it wouldn't move, you can declare it phantom and then you can
pass right through it

tiptoe suspected

scheme: playing quietly as possible
bow hardly touching the strings
vibrato through violin shaking
separated emptied phrases
reverb gluing phrases together
distance among them
themes bridging phrases
post-production normalization
post-production hard-limiting
what you hear is what you get
scheme golden ratio successful

<julu1> I'm here at last, thank you GOD!
<julu1> At the moment, nothing but a blank screen against a background, 
what?
<julu1> Burnished aluminum. So you might meet me here, Nikuko, if you have 
the time.
<julu1> Then what? In 2011, avoiding everything but the UDP wirewaves.
<julu1> I could pass you warez.
<julu1> I could pass.
<julu1> I could send secrets.
<julu1> Secrets could disappear.
<julu1> You could see my flesh and bone.
<julu1> Now you see my bone.
<julu1> In the trade we say "bone only."
<julu1> It's different than off the grid.
<julu1> The grid breaks down anyway - UDP, netsplit, the whole nine yards.
<julu1> I know you're listening to me because I know you're here because 
someone is typing this.
<julu1> There are bones making letters, molecules on the move -
<julu1> It's not just inside your head (your reading this) or mine (my 
writing this).
<julu1> It's not a style, it's bone. It's the hard white bone surrounded 
by flesh.
<julu1> You'd pay a silly dollar to see some silly flesh.
<julu1> Ignore everything you think you know; focus on the bone. On the 
nub of the bone. On the burl.
<julu1> What presses against something to make this, what might make you 
press against something else.
<julu1> These are the warez I'm passing to you, clothed in flesh.
<julu1> The bone is the secret. The bone is the secret bone.
<julu1> You'll pay attention to the flesh, forget the secret. Caress the 
flesh: bone stops it.
<julu1> Bone stops it in this and every other channel.
<julu1> Bone stops it, but you swallow the flesh. I dream you this: 
Tonight you dream.
<julu1> Tonight you dream of the flesh. 
<julu1> (My secrets are safe.)

somewhere in there's a wormy tune * floating on a wormed balloon * 
trailing notes of wormed festoon * violinists tell me it's a boon * when 
it occurs near waning moon * softly hear the call of loon * speaking deep 
unearthly rune * have you seen the film called dune * the worm sang out 
the month of june * coming for a concert soon * starting midnight not at 
noon * listen to the worming croon * by this violinist goon * notes to 
left and right are strewn * eaten by the dank raccoon * the music's dark 
almost maroon * drink or slurp it with a spoon * almost a song more like 
cartoon * tune balloon festoon boon moon * loon rune dune june soon noon 
croon goon * strewn raccoon maroon spoon tune * cartoon cartoon cartoon
