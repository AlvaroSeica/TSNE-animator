"credo


"every word forms a sentence
and it's a sentence of life and death

"every sound expels the breath
and it's the last word of the sentence

"there's no other writing that means
anything in the longer run of things

"when the world is, it stings
and carries everything that means

"i can't read poems that are just poems
or stories going nowhere and flat

"when language is only that
there are no stories and poems

"at least urgency, hunger, intensity
start something, mess it up

"don't ever write it up
without desperate immensity

"then whatever you think
this poem kills itself

"because it isn't itself
wastes words whatever you think"


 - maybe Nicanor Parra
