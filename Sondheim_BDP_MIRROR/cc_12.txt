Which (musing further) leads me to believe that by the time pine, tin, 
Phoenix IRC, etc. were developed, baudrate had sped up sufficiently so 
that redraws weren't a problem. Which means there are still ways to make 
the applications leaner just as SMTP is leaner than Columbia mail which 
is leaner than elm which is leaner than Pine which is far leaner than 
Eudora and we can just continue upwards in the spiral outwards.

I wonder if there were .sigs in 300 baud days and how they were handled - 
the constant redraw slowed things up at least 50%. In other words, if 
there's a .sig in a post, then all text above it is an _insert_ and each 
new line of text moves the .sig down one, which has to be redrawn...

And I still can't figure out the download mode, except that it seems to 
call up awk for some reason at the Unix prompt!

Next stop, the abacus (I've written, by the way, on the abacus, somewhere 
in the earlier parts of the Internet text, .sig below, having used both 
Japanese and Chinese variants) ...
