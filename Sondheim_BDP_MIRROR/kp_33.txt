It's 40/41


30/10/41, 30/10/2541, 10/30/98, 10/30/1998, time and again I will return
you know I will return
I will never be away
there will be no moment when I will be away
these times from unknown counts
there are always such, always such moment when I will be true to you
I will return and return, that is how I will be true
this isn't "psychological" but this is "net theory"

"net theory" accepts many dates for the deconstruction of our very own.
it is our very own that is in sad remiss.
you know that is true, and that is "net theory."
if this is "net art."
I am desperate that this be "net art." I am desperate that this 
"net art" is also "net theory" of a high order which has an effect
on the way everyone thinks about "the net."

30/10/41, 30/10/2541, 10/30/98, 10/30/1998, are the dates I have 
started to work on this "net art" of a high order, which will be 
available on "the net." this is the first part of the "net theory,"
this "availability," which is very widespread into unknown parts, 
just as 30/10/41 is also very much spread from unknown parts, into
other unknown parts.

there are many times and Jennifer lives in all of them, 
and Jennifer has, as she has said many times before,
all the time in the world, because Jennifer has whatever times 
and number you want and think, well I am here for a very short time,
and this is the time I want for Jennifer,
Fri Oct 30 04:21:23 EST 1998

this is how she works, as you take her up when I die in the real world,
the final wound not healing, final hard drive crash, sliver of light
against one or another angry sky or mob, she will pass on presence in the
system, disseminated everywhere in "net culture," "net art" and "net
theory," struggling in 2541 to awaken, begin again, you will always
remember Jennifer, or if not, Jennifer will be there, for your terrific
memory gift. I will go into the fields of the lord, I have my date with
Jennifer, Jennifer is my date
