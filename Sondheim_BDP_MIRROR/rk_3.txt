My mind isn't right.

I stand in the way of the living. I impede the living. I breathe their 
air. I devour the living.

What I've done is all that I'm capable of doing. This is a poor excuse
for life. I'm capable of nothing. I don't dream but have bad dreams.

I am a literary exercise. I use machines to speak for me. I am a factory. 
I am a dirty factory. I am industrial. I spew poison.

To live with me is hell. To read me is hell. I offer contradiction. Am
impaled on the hinge of contradiction. That way I bide time.

My writing is no excuse. My writing is as useless as I am. I am a mass 
of flesh. I think to myself, this mass, this mess. I am a thick avatar.
Closer to death I stand in the way of the living.

I take strong medicine to sleep. I don't sleep. I write. I forget what
I write. In the morning I read. To read me is hell. To write me is hell.

An abyss defines nothing. An abyss falls into itself. I am a dirty 
factory.

I fuck myself, open cunts in the cocktip, churn flesh back to you, but I

Telegraph

The 19th century telegraph and railroad provided the first habitus
for virtual communities. The railroad objectified time and created
the potential for liaisons at a distance. The telegraph workers used
their spare time to talk to one another - friendships and marriages
resulted. The telegraph used a protocol stack reminiscent of tcp/ip
- the layers ranged from hardware to application, with redundancy
and several layers of coding, including addressable messaging
systems, in-between. The telegraph has its parallels in ascii, in
terms of bandwidth; visual telegraphy never really caught on. The
telegraph communality was celebrated in popular literature and song.
For a long time I've been interested in the apparatus itself as 
well; recently in Omaha, I was able to buy a small station consist-
ing of a sounder and key. Soon I'll have a telegraph between my
table and Azure's desk, about twenty feet away.

Brief Synopsis of the Republican Plaform

http://www.alansondheim.org/platform.mp4

Republicans make me nauseous; their apparent takes on race,
sex, fair play, the environment, the 1% - you name it - are 
corrosive, inherently violent, hypocritical. Anyway as you
know, I can't write about this - I don't have the knowledge
many of my colleagues do. So I express myself sometimes in
song and sometimes in video, and this is video. Mind you,
this is the platform of the bad Republicans, those who 
would control our bodies and minds and take what little
health care we have, away. And I think this Republican
Platform video, like the Platform Sutra itself, is full of
joy, reverence, and contradiction! Onward, good Republicans!




the Instrument of music in ground of the room

for Jackson Moore

the Instrument sits there in the middle of the room.
it sits on the side of the room.
the Instrument is immobile, delicate, obdurate.
it's like a body, the Instrument.
it's like the flesh, it meanders, it returns.
it is the sound of someone and the sound of someone's sound.
it is the sound of community, lineage, wood, stone, steel, silk.
the Instrument plays the flesh and the body, it is out of the way.
it is out of the way because it is in the way, always otherwise.
the Instrument is elsewhere, inaudible, murmuring earth.
it is always virtual and is never virtual, it is tethered.
the Instrument is tethered to coordinates, to practice.
the Instrument is tethered to the motions of the body.
to the motions of the fingers, mouth, lips, tongue, arms, hands.
to the voice, with which it begins, with which it ends.
the Instrument tends towards damage, virtuosity, materiality.
one tends the Instrument, a living being tending an other.
recalling stewardship, the instrument.
the cries of the hardware layer, application layer, no difference.
undifferentiated, the earth recalls itself.
overlooked, its sound carries, radio, television, net, ether.
it breathes the ether, inconceivable, non-existent, no difference.
the Instrument returns the instrumental.
in the corner of the room one huddles, the misery of death,
the misery of tending, the misery of stewardship, the misery of
Instruments, the misery of networks, of protocols, of suites,
the misery of nomads -
- the eternal misery of the earth, the escape from earth, 
the escape from death, the escape from miseries, wandering,
escaping -
buried in the network, all of human culture, abjection keep out!
the Instrument is dirty, my muscles are fatigued, 
pay me for my labor, pay me for my Instrument, my tending, 
pay me for my stewardship - here is the secret -
the Instrument has no parts -
the Instrument has no exchange and therefore no exchange value -
and therefore no protocols, no networks, no television, radio,
no net, no ether - the Instrument falls with a thud -
the nomad falls with a thud - 
- sit there at the side of the room -
- at the corner or vertex of the room -
- somewhere on the ground or floor of the room -
- somewhere slaughter begins, in rooms like this one -
- somewhere nothing remains, oh the animals are all dead -
- the plants are all dead - there are still debates -
- lands to be determined - it's all in the Imaginary -
- it's all there - it stays after us - it dies with us -
- networks and netsplits - cracks and rootkits -
- in the body of the Instrument - in the root-body -
- in the root - in the abjection-root and the death-root -
- in the tending-root and the shepherding root -
- in the temperature root and the humidity root -
- in the root of the sun by night and the moon by day -
- cracks in the sounding board, strings rustling, snapping
or strings snapping, rustling, sounding board memories
or fingerboard wear or the sound of a string loosening,
loosening in the middle of the night, other strings 
resonant in unison, other strings murmuring, whispering
there goes one of us, we shall not see hir like again,
someday it will be our turn, someday we too, loosening,
the memory of the Instrument loosening, so many fingers!
so many hands, notes, songs!, so many songs! one among
many, many among one, these coordinates, I will carry 
this forth, these addressings, direct and indirect, I 
will carve this memory, this Instrument, in stone by the
side of the room, in earth by the sky of the room, in
code by the wall of the room, I will carve, I will
continue to carve, constant I will continue to carve,
in the floor by the side of the sky near the ground of
the wall by the corner of the vertex near the sky of
the side of the wall, near the wall, or the side of the
sky, that's it!, near the side of the sky, that's it!,
that's it!, exactly -



Tracks from the Eyebeam Sound Summit

I recorded the following tracks at the summit; most of it focuses on my 
playing - which might or might not be of interest. The baritone sax is 
Chris Diasparra. The singing in the summit13 is Seth Dellinger, who floats 
in and out. The occasional thumps elsewhere are from the interior of Mary 
Mattingly's Flock House. I played sarangi with Ben Houge's sounds, as well 
as sounds coming in from others on the OSC network. There are two tracks 
based on Kyle Clyde's giant plate reverb unit. I played sarangi, flute, 
viola, cura cumbus, and garklein recorder. On one track, I walk through 
the space, recording and passing what everyone's doing. Apologies for 
emphasizing my own work; Jackson Moore recorded everything, and others 
recorded their own work as well. I'm amazed at the richness of Chris' 
baritone and Seth's singing; on summit13, my speed's pushed to the limit. 
The whole event was astounding! Thanks to everyone, especially Jackson for 
putting this together! (Apologies also if I've missed credits here; I've
done my best of course.)

The original announcement with URLs and descriptions from Jackson -

	On April 21st, Eyebeam's main exhibition space will be transformed 
into a small village dedicated to creative sound research. Using resources 
as diverse as atmospheric sensors, string instruments, reverberant plates, 
magnetized wires, cell phones, data hubs, and laughter, participants from 
Eyebeam's sound research group will convene to run experiments, share 
original research, develop work in progress, and explore collaborative 
strategies.

Interaction, encounter, and juxtaposition will be emphasized over sound 
isolation.the idea being that sound is transparent enough to permit a 
human ecology that transcends the singular focus of the concert format.

Kyle Clyde will test sound absorbancy, sound bleed, and feedback 
thresholds with her giant plate reverb unit.
http://www.kyleclyde.com/

Bernhard Garnicnig will examine the resonant frequencies and specific 
sonic qualities of networked devices.
http://www.acgunsdcroses.com/2011/volumes

Christine Sun-Kim will experiment with strategies for encoding sounds on 
magnetic wire.
http://christinesunkim.com/

Jackson Moore, John Speck, Russell Baker, and Rob Lee will work on a 
melodic pidgin language.
http://www.thelanguageofmoss.com/listen-to-moss

David Reeder's OSC network will turn a ping pong table in Cambridge into a 
metronome in Chelsea, and much much more.

Mike Clemow will be working over the OSC server with a the roving laptop 
brigade, sampling and interacting with the surrounding space.
http://michaelclemow.com/

Yo Park will lead exercises in laughter, with Andrew Sigler, Cigdem 
Tankut, Gulsen Caulk, Gabriel Levicky, Jayoung Chung, Victor De La Cruz, 
and others.

Alan Sondheim, Azure Carter, and Chris Diasporra will revisit the 
discovery of music: the moment when people first began figuring out how to 
make sound with objects. http://www.alansondheim.org/

Seth Dellinger will develop his phonemic vocal music.
http://www.scribd.com/doc/44190101/Introduction-to-the-Beeayboll-project

Ben Houge will construct his auditory kaleidoscope, and provide sensor 
data from the MIT Media Lab for sonification. 
http://benhouge.com/kaleidoscope.html

Amelia Marzec will demo Re-wired, a wearable device that translates 
ambient sound into haptic feedback. http://www.ameliamarzec.com/rewired/

Brian House will sonify his compendium of rhythms from everyday life.
http://rhythmanalysislab.org/about

Mary Mattingly brings us the sound of place: the Flock House living 
system, and its peripatetic denizens. http://flockhouse.org/

With a special surprise from Hethre Contant's Texas Mockingbirds.

The day will end with a public conversation at 7pm.
