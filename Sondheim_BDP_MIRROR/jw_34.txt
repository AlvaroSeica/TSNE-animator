		 pay me five dollars and when i come,
			i'll cry out your name
		  pay me five dollars, and, coming,
	      i'll cry your name out, in the empty room

	    pay me seven and i'll caress my naked breasts,
		whispering, I love you, and for eight,
			  i love you <name>

	     your name my love, your name, and for nine,
	     your name my love, your name, and for nine

	  pay me ten and i'll grasp air, calling you softly
	       i will wrap my arms around the empty air
		    and i will grasp the empty air

	for fifteen you'll be in all my dreams, and for twenty
	      i'll promise anything, tossing and turning
       in the bed alone, tossing and turning in that empty bed

       and for twenty, you will have me, you will have my name,
		  for twenty, you will have my name

	and for thirty, when you come, i will write @hold you,
			 @hold you in my arms

	 you need not fear escalating prices, i promise you,
	 they remain the same for all time, and as for forty,
			you dream of naked me,
			you dream of naked me

      and now there are no higher prices, this empty air expands
	     and covering your body, and penetrating you,
	  in my dreams, and forever you will have your name
			     upon my lips
		you will have your name, upon my lips,
			       forever
