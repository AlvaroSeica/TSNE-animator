Message 836 on *Chatter (#4399):
Date:     Tue Aug  6 23:17:01 1996 EDT
From:     Sandra (#15756)
To:       *Chatter (#4399)
Subject:  Being Here

If I send this message to you, I am here; when I come on another time
I will be greeted by an announcement that I have arrived, come on, and
written this, in order to come on again, be greeted by an announcement -
that I have left a trace behind, that the trace is not a spoor, that the
trace is all there is, but that there is comfort, cold comfort to be sure,
in that, comfort in the way of a greeting, as Sandra finds herself once
again, if only as @find, locating a part of herself slivered and of no
consequence in the middle of a (dis)located email list beyond which no
one travels, in this or any other direction.
Sandra
