[Wryting in Mail/mail at 300 baud: To Be]


T-Bone showed me the ways of composition at 300 using the old Unix mail
system. There is no visible interface here, only characters coming into
existence on the screen, one after the other, line by line. It's now the
duty of the keyboard itself to track everything, and _this_ keyboard (HP
110 laptop again) is difficult to the touch... 

Is it the case, then (in the sense: The world is all the case.) - that
interface is always already scan, that the visible is a particular kind of
construct here? Even interlaced, the screen is not the result of parallel
processing, but a sequential production. Anything beyond that in fact re-
verberates with the necessity to return over and over again to the begin-
ning, top or bottom of the buffer, because what is visible is a prior
frame; nothing is outside the frame, and the frame is _generated._

So the phenomenological real is a construct (nothing new here); there are
processes and protocols involved. And the earlier Unix programs such as
mail come closest to _pure_ text, nothing else on the screen, no framework
but that occupied by the text itself. So that, elsewhere, where I speak 
of the _ascii unconscious,_ surely not talking about Pine, Elm, Pico - the 
editor which in MOO is known simply as _enter_ comes closest. _Enter_ the 
text or its diegesis. Write oneself into and out of existence. _To be._
