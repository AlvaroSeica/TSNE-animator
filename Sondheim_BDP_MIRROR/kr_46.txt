When I die, I want to take you with me,
 I want to take ten of the ten, and fifteen of the fifteen,
  And I will wear the dreary blue-blue you have given me -
There will be one atom left, to placate the dreary vacuum,
 One molecule grappled by cell-counts sloughed and scrambled,
  Tissue rent asunder, organs corroded, soul's debris abandoned -
And I will wear the blue-blue, I will wear the overcoat and ring,
 Carnelion round my neck, magnetite across my throat, and singing -
  Your name - as I am torn asunder, the fifteen dreary words,
The ten lost and forlorn colors, the fifteen dying notes,
 The ten corroded sites - you Blue-Blue, wear my overcoat - 
  You Blue-Blue wear my ring - placate my death with dreary yours -
What a vacuum here, and souls of dying atoms split asunder
 Stumble just beneath you Blue-Blue, taking me abandoned -
