Hi there, my god you've made it through here...

When I was in the cave then was I dancing outside the cave, exposing

myself to myself

And I would grab myself, stop the useless flight back into the darkness,

surely; and the grain would grow, the trees flower, cherry blossoms

everywhere...

Curved into me, like a flower or a seed, curved through my loins, stomach,

through my mouth and throat

Which here I place upon the page for you to read, to comprehend, to pass

down, generation after generation
