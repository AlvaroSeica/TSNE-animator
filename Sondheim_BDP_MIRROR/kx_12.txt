and and and i am in love, trembling, your voice, image, voice-image, memo-
ries of days in california, and and and these chemicals make beautiful
worlds and and the object of imaginary consciousness is within me and and
breathing your air, and and and the imaginary makes me yours and and and i
am naked inside you, crawl through you, your pictures are on me, in me, at
night there are you images, and and and california, and and days and
nights in california and forever, and and and i am your gift and and at
night i hear your voice again and and and see you hear you talking that
day that night in california and and and thinking of you i can't breathe
and every word world is yours and and and
"For the rest, the object as an image is an unreality. It is no doubt pre-
sent, but, at the same time, it is out of reach. I cannot touch it, change
its place: or rather I can well do so, but on condition that I do it in an
unreal way, by not using my own hands but those of some phantoms which
give this face unreal blows: to act upon these unreal objects I must div-
ide myself, make myself _unreal._" (Sartre, The Psychology of Imagina-
tion) and and and
the world conjoins my arms and yours, some phantoms kiss us lovingly, some
phantoms divide one two three, and and and some phantoms take our names,
and and and some phantoms give our names and and and Azure this is hard to
write and and and
"When I look at a drawing, I posit in that very glance a world of human
intentions of which that drawing is a product. A man drew these lines in
order to produce the likeness of a runner. Of course this likeness will
appear only with the cooperation of my consciousness. But the artist knows
this; he counts on it; he asks for this cooperation by means of his black
lines. We must not believe that these lines appear to me first in percep-
tion as pure and simple lines, and only afterwards as the elements of a
_representation_ in the imaginary attitude. They appear as such in the
perception itself." (Sartre) and and and 
you tell me, draw me, draw me, draw me towards you, and I lose myself in
your lines, our lines, our lineaments, and and and we draw within one
another, draw on one another, draw ourselves into our lives and life and
living within the imaginary and and and watching the edges
where they come towards one another and and
where they form loving homes and moments suspended and and and
moments when the picture turns and holds out and and and
holds out loving arms
