torus into cybersphere

because my body is a torus, if you fill my hole, 
you connect with empty space.
you think you've got me, but you've just moved anywhere.
i want the weight of your body onto me.
i want that purple thing into me.
i want to give with st. elmo's fire.
i want to dance with st. vitus' disease.
_you wear what you do to me_ _i am what you do to me_
my breasts burn for you! my nipples freeze for you!
i'm your fish-netted stockings torn with purple!
you do that! you put that thing into me!
because my body's sealed! because you seal it!
my body's lost a hand! it's mine!
