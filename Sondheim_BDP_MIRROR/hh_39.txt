Explain


The literary texts have a surplus that explanations don't; they escape,
loosen the con-text. They form kennings, conundrums, with no specific un-
raveling, no further decoding. The literary carries theory into therapeu-
tic, in the sense of a necessary textual work done/undone by the reader.

It's something that requires an extension, she said, just as the element
of narrative I have created with "she said" produces already a setting,
podium or city square, coffeehouse or apartment, where such discussions or
presentations occur. When the text becomes an occurrence, it presents a
degree of inertia. It holds or spans a diegetic.

It catches you up, she added, just like this.
