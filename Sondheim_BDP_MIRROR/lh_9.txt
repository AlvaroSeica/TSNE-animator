Parable


There once was a lion who terrorized the villages of southern Kyushu.
Nikuko was walking near Kirishimayama one day, hoping for enlightenment.
The more she hoped, the farther she walked, and the farther she walked,
the more hopeless her condition. Mired in emotion, she vanquished the lion
in a dreamlike state from which she never recovered. Now enlightened, she
continued her terrorization of the villages, plundering, raping, and mur-
dering, without cause, with great effect. She knew there were no lions.
