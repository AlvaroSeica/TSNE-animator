Jennifer, ThE nEw MaChInE


Swollen, tumescent, pubescent, distended, gaping maw's software hardware
upgrade, fabrik-machine hard at work churning into soft soiled soil, rim-
job architecture transformation plugged in, turned-out: I await with gap-
ing arms, broad wide smile, teeth sparkling clean: Here you come!

:connects the tiniest little wire to the tiniest little wire!
:caresses the tiniest little jumper just so! here and there!
:runs hir finger just along the rim of the tiniest little floppy drive!

Now towards evening, Machine sleeps humming quietly. What morning will
bring, my testing-noon, testing-room, new parts inserted! Each machine a
cyborg ready to happen up!

My Sisters, I Write the Birthing of a New Machine! (This Phrase Coming
Several Hours After the Last.) Nervously I Pace Elsewhere; in the Early
Noon, I will Carefully Approach the Towering Box, Listen to its Needy
Fanning Hummmm. (This Phrase Much Later.) Tiny Lights Will Say What All 
is Right or Wrong: I will Type: CONNECT!!!!

Hi! I'm still here, still waiting. It takes time to _Cure_ a new machine,
cyborg-caulking hardening in place, cleaning up the scarps and skimpers. 
(Much much later!!!!) Tomorrow will always be the dawn of a new day. (The
sun fixes in the sky. It stays the same place forever. Earth heats up and
gets cold. Jennifer moves towards the center where everything evens out
and there are new microbes. But there's also a huge crystal and Jennifer
sneezes and the little crack flies apart.)

Hi! I'm the New-Machine-Soul ready for Insertion! My Little Crack Flies
Apart! Hi Jennifer!!!! 

(MuCh MuCh MuCh LaTeR!!!! THE END!!!!)
