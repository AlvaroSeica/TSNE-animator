"open the gates".

.

.

open the gates, characterizes the phenomenology.

tear down the gateposts: i am sick, stumbling.

fill the postholes; there are signs and fields.

erase the signs - now space stumbles into space.

space is gone space, suddenly, nikuko and izanagi.

do not fear, they say, things will soon be halted.

wider and wider, there is no language for this.

memory loses itself; beyond memory, memory.

beyond loss, loss: that tiny little thing..

of the darkest thing, encode, replies izanagi.

of the darkest, coding, says nikuko.

code heaving, its cunt thrust open.

izanagi goes away, nikuko brings signs to humans.

time takes signs away.
