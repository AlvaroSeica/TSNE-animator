Nietzsche fumbles with the children, dumb! dumb! He thinks, I have to save
them from me! He thinks, their beautiful little limbs! He thinks Meat
thinks Sex thinks LOOK AT THAT SWING OUT THERE! FUCK THE FACTORY!  The
Tiny Little Girl Falls Down BOOM BOOM! And Twists Her Little LEG!  

Nietzsche Sues The Factory, Factory Down in Flames. That Will Teach them! 

Nietzsche KNOWS he HAS TO SAVE THE CHILDREN! THEY WERE NEVER SAFE FUCK 
THEM THEY WERE NEVER SAFE DAMN THEM! They Were HUNTED DOWN all these 
Centuries of EVIL, BURNED AT COCK-STAKES DICK-STAKES ROD-STAKES! Men 
Slavered Over THem! He hAS to SAVE THE CHILDREN!

DReaming His CAR, HERE'S what he dreams:

I am riding in a 1968 red Chevrolet and my two lovely children are in the
back seat and I have a terrible accident and they are thrown through the
Windshield and Cut Up and it is THIS Terrible Thing that it all the Fault
of Chevrolet for Bad Seatbelts and the Municipal County of Luzerne for Bad
Roads and Mayor Terrison for not repairing them and cutting back the
budget for his own ends. I WILL PUT MAYOR TERRISON IN JAIL AND SUE LUZERNE

BE THE CHILDREN'S SAVIOR. He THINKS: Swimming Pools, HIGHWAYS, Cry-Baby 
Dolls, Hard Edge of Barbie's Tits, Hard Poke of Ken's Rod, He THINKS: 
TELEVISION SEXYVISION, Bad Words On The Radio, Internet SUCKINGCOCKS, 
TONGUING CUNTS. He THinks, MY Brain's bloWING up, Have to Write this Down.

HE WRITES:

I AM THE CHILDREN'S SAVIOR. LISTEN: I AM THE CHILDREN'S SAVIOR.

HE WRITES:

I AM THE CHILDREN'S SAVIOR.

He chews his tit off. He chews his ball off. He chews his cock off. 
Last he chews his hands down to the bone. He can't hold the fucking pen.

Fuck them.
