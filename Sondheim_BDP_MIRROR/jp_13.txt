"Somos la voz de un dios."


"We are the voice of a god."

Speak about what you know about me. Speak about how I hold this space. 
When my words stutter in real life, when I no longer can look you in the
eye. 

"The text is the author's disobedience." (Ivan Silen, El Llanto de las
Ninfomanas / The Wail of the Nymphomaniacs.) To have telephone from the
nymphomanias, to have received a telephone call, from Jennifer: the way-
ward girl. 

Speak of assurance, the uniting assurance society. Lying in bed, I tend
towards the horizon of the frayed blanket, words thrust through fringed
edges, retied, anything to hold the self in check, circumscribe through
coagulated murmurs.

Disobedient, because it writes/wrytes itself, as a top or gyroscope rights
itself through the loving double hands of gravity. Mr. Carruthers says he
is sick of Jennifer texts, which no longer obey the rigours of thought. 

Speak about what you know about me. Speak my name when you dream at night,
when you are on your deathbed, when you are pointing your accusing finger,
when you are attending the lineup, when you are close to perfect coming,
when you are in the fervour of prayer and absolution; speak my name when
you are walking down the street, when you are humming in the shower, when
you beg for forgiveness, when you shudder at your bad thoughts; and speak
my name when your fingers recreate you, when you carry your child into the
world, and your child out of it; and speak my name when darkness lightness
ascends, when the lantern tips, when the wind rings slightly warmer than
the day is long.
