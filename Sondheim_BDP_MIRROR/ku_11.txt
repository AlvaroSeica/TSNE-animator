(from Nikuko)


Nikuko says, I start this text one fine evening, and I will end it on ano-
ther. There is snow on the ground and flurries in the air, and dark-suited
pedestrians walk home, sullen, beneath the gaslights. I can hear them from
my own darkness, my own world, the screen pregnant, slightly swollen. If
you would only listen, I would tell you how, on the morrow, a great golden
globe shall fill the sky, with golden rays, and universal peace shall
descend upon all human-kind. The dead will walk, the fish will fly. But I
am lost with the umbrellas in St. Petersburg, where you will find me
rushing off to a Nihilist meeting, where we will discuss the Crimea and
the Jewish Question. And I do believe in my heart of hearts that I am
tending towards Fyodor's position; perhaps on the morrow as well, we shall
march on Constantinople. The light is dim; two peasant women move hurridly
out of the way of several Cossacks on horseback. Last night, I dreamed of
1903, and woke in wonder at our all-too-brief life on earth. Now I wonder
how you will find me. And I am lost in scarves and skirts, faces muffled
against the icy wind. St. Petersburg is no place to be this time of year;
some would say, at any. I am pregnant, with longing, and with child. And
I know, again on the morrow, beneath these dimmed winter nights, that my
time will come as well. I am no man's burden.
