Why you are saved from my texts, because I'm here (humid) in Dallas,

because I'm working on a presentation full of interrupts (breaking-down,

collapsing), because (showing slides of .profile, lynx_bookmarks files),

explaining (aliases) or an attempt to hold an audience (flesh) against the

terminal (itself simply screened, screening the screen) (inordinate) so

that I can continue theory Mr. Anxiety on the lecture circuit (open, no

current), storing texts, writing texts, decaying texts; why you are saved

from my texts, because I'm there (humid) in Kentucky, because I'm

interrupting my presentations (completing, rising up), because (turning

the machinery off), dissipating (true names), turning aside from every-

one but (flesh) adjacent to the terminal (unscreened) (wayward, contrary),

so that theory's abjured Msr. Sutured on the circuit of flesh.
