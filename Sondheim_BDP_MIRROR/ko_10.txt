Jennifer, Autrui


In Communications 66, La contagion, Sylvie Fainzang, La marque de l'autre,
describes the phenomenology between contagious and transmissible diseases.
The latter spread through direct physical contact, AIDS for example. The
former are spread through indirect or mediated contact - insects or rats -
but the implication is greater - a spreading through the virtual-real of
breath or scent. Flu, for example. Thus I would consider magnetism a form
of contagion, and perhaps hypnosis as well. Think of rumor, the telephone,
think of Jennifer.

The virtual-real and the virtual problematize death; a single ghost turns
the world upside-down. Contagion promises the eerie; there is no longer a
fundamental ontology that is not superseded.

The avatar acts at a distance: apparently digital, apparently eternal, and
we ignore the fact that digital media, _of_ the practico-inert, wear out,
that formats become unreadable, that physical deterioration can render any
information corrupt. Dearth is forestalled. Think of death as a _binary_
opposition which, if rendered in the analog, refuses the asymptote, wan-
ders and cross the coordinate instead: there's a zero-point somewhere in
the nearby future. I wouldn't say for all of us, said Jennifer.

Contagion: scents, _unholy_ vapors, breath, one's neighborhood, an odd
glance, a spell cast, autosuggestion.

One ghost delays death. One ghost promises the virtual always. One ghost
is any ghost, is Jennifer. The virtual, a disease, has always been with
us. Our vision is such. We are always half in, half out, of the world. And
this is _no matter,_ what, the definition.
