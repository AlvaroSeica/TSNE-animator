Documenting Live


I write in and through depression, exhilaration, space and time. Later it
will be assumed that I documented my inexorable march towards suicide or
death or madness. Oh! Which shall it be? What signs are visible here, what
boats wrecked on shoals already identified against which continents? These
words already harbor the numinous, containing the future anterior seeds of
memory. I could speak of unmitigated tears, random bouts of laughter, that
haunted look I carry about with me, mixed with embarrassment and shame, my
lack of savoir-faire, my writings for and of that very same future that
dooms me. The walls have tears, the walls have masks of hearty laughter.
The tiniest little thing brings tears, its exhilaration and salvation re-
turn loving laughter. Steadfast cats and plants and atmospheres surround
me. Oh! Which shall it be? Oh!
