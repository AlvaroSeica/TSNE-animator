Ahmet and Shtetl

http://www.alansondheim.org/ahmet.mp3
 -- eight-string Ahmet Tekeli saz --

http://www.alansondheim.org/shtetl.mp3
 -- azure carter tamburi --
 -- alan sondheim viola --

working on the saz, added two more strings, tuning
g(3)-d(2)-a(3) somewhat circular. the second half 
is played with the sound hole 'door' open on the
end of the body. I think Ahmet and Shtetl are some
of my best playing, stemming from the texts I've
been writing as well, thinking through mourning,
keening, ecstasy, frisson - thinking through hands
and fingers, setting and resetting the instruments
themselves. enjoy, hopefully -



seven notes holding my mind together

seven notes that didn't head towards consonance
oh yes they tried, they yearned, but i refused
it was this that held my mind together
refusing the consonance, keeping them scurrying

it was in that fashion that they never left or arrived
they marched to and fro, they murmured, they pleaded
it was in my fashion to hold keep them in abeyance
after all nothing was ever promised, nothing at all

i was honored tonight by the saz of ahmet tekeli
he gave me permission to play endlessly on and on
without the gift of reciprocity, without beginning
without end, somewhere one had to stop, someplace one
 had to desist

now these seven notes have saved my life
and nothing will ever resolve again
the scissors remain open, the wound never heals
ecstasy never leaves the place, alive or dead

seven notes that didn't head anywhere
seven notes without the gift of ending or beginning
seven notes that didn't head anywhere at all




The Standard National Corpus


The following was written for Scott Kildall's "Imagine 2049" project,
at http://www.imagine2049.com . Scott wrote "Do you want to submit an 
invention for the future? Taking online submissions for the next few days 
only. All of this goes in a time capsule." I was delighted to take part.


The Standard National Corpus


Around 1962 I was at Hebrew University in Jerusalem; the Hebrew language 
was undergoing rapid change as it was continually updated to adapt to 
contemporary life. I remember in particular, when I arrived, the word for 
'airplane' was 'aviron'; it was later formally changed to 'matos' which 
stemmed from Hebrew, not European roots. Today either word is acceptable 
according to Segal/Dagut's English-Hebrew Dictionary. The basic concept 
behind these changes was to create a purified language with as little 
linguistic borrowing as possible. Later, I noticed the same thing in 
Montreal, in the debate over the Quebecois language - whether or not to 
eliminate anglicisms, whether the anglicisms were inherent to Quebecois, 
and so forth (see 'joual' in Wikipedia for exampe). These debates have 
occurred all over the world as nationalisms put up barriers in order to 
create theoretically-pure lexicons reflecting theoretically-pure national 
groups. I propose a formal software program for linguistic purification. 
It would examine the current state of a language, as well as its history 
for at least several centuries. This can be accomplished by collating 
acceptable vocabularies. From this, it should be possible to weed out 
words of 'foreign' origin, especially if they're of recent appearance. The 
definitions of these words could be then be used to create alternative 
words based on the language's 'native' roots and resources.

Once all of this is done, of course, it will be announced to the local 
population who will surely adopt the substitutions; everyone is happiest 
with purity! Furthermore, the updating can be continuous; in this way, 
eternal vigilance is the guarantor of the strength and depth of native 
stock. No GMOs (genetically modified organisms) here!

Finally, of course, this idea of automated purification can be applied to 
any number of different areas - don't worry, we'll stay away from eugenics 
but we will include animal breeding! - ensuring that any nation's natural 
culture and inclinations (as well as borders and tariffs) will continue 
forever!

oud nearing the end of illness

http://lounge.espdisk.com/archives/1020 (best)
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/oudflu.mp3

returning to playing again, trying to think, and oddly
this is probably the most unique oud playing i've done;
it really brings out the range of the Shehata instrument.
i wanted to play in close, develop clusters; the result
isn't anything i've heard before. some of the fingering
technique is from my violin or viola playing; the right
hand is on its own. there's almost a gaiety at work,
fractured and coalescing. enjoy.

confession

i realize my music is barking up the wrong tree.
my music is absolutely useless and misshapen.
it's not zen, it's just clumsy.
i'm lucky if i can hit intervals at all.
consider this a wordy piece of silence.
it's an admission of guilt in the production of bad music.
it's an admission of tricks and subterfuge with instruments.
i dream of fires of wood and steel strings singing their
 final songs.
i dream of boats of woods and steel struts carrying
 refugees away from me.
i hear differences where none are and nothing where
 differences are.
i hear innovation where there's nothing but tired 
 repetition and i hear melodic repetition where i'm 
 running out of ideas.
i jump from instrument to instrument as i exhaust my
 limited resources on each one.
i jump from speed to speed to impress and disguise the
 fact i can't hold a note for any length of time.
my instruments are beautiful and deserve better.
you are accurate in your assessment that there's too much
 of my music around, too much craziness, too much 
 exhaustion.
i pretend to focus on technique and exercises when all 
 i'm doing is trying something out with an impressive
 surface devoid of any depth.
my music isn't barking up the wrong tree, it's not even
 music, it's not even noise, or it's noise intended to 
 be music.
the only delight it brings is the usual shortness of the
 pieces but sometimes i err further and produce what 
 appears on the surface like a meditation but in fact is
 just a lengthy poverty of ideas.
my fingers move by themselves in idiotic patterns.
my mind stumbles in idiotic pursuit.
this confession should suffice, please control your
 anger.
there's no reason to listen to anything more.

confessions - more of the same, the end of them

the medium is irrelevant; it's the bad psychology, the
 stolen and repetitive mechanism, the lack of ideas, the
 showy exteriors, the dabbling in body, sex and language.

i realize my texts are barking up the wrong tree.

it's not zen, it's just clumsy plagiarism.

this confession should suffice, please control your

there's no reason to read anything of mine again.

for example,

i realize my media works are barking up the wrong tree.
they're absolutely useless and misshapen.
it's not zen, it's just clumsy plagiarism.
i'm lucky if i can program at all; i can't; i borrow
 from everyone; the underlying structures are similar
 and boring; clever camera angles cover up the rest.
consider this a wordy piece of silence.
it's an admission of guilt in the production of bad media
 art.
it's an admission of tricks and subterfuge with scripts.
i dream of virtual fires everywhere
i dream of virtual drownings and theoretical confusion.
i makes differences where none are and nothing where
 differences are.
i see innovation where there's nothing but tired 
 plagiarism and i'm constantly running out of ideas.
i use scripts to hide whatever truths there are; i steal
 everywhere, from everyone; i create the surface lure and
 an inconceivable absence of depth. 
i jump from environment to environment, performance to 
 performance, as i exhaust my limited resources each and
 every time.
i jump from style to style to impress and disguise the
 fact i haven't created anything in depth or any new idea
 that might be useful.
my avatars deserve better.
you are accurate in your assessment that there's too much
 of my media work around, too much craziness, too much 
 exhaustion.
i pretend to focus on philosophy and phenomenology when 
 all i'm doing is creating something with an impressive
 surface that belongs to everyone else, that desperately
 seeks attention, that plays fool-heartedly with language,
 sex, and body, that uses arousal as deflection from any
 real content; everyone sees through me.
my media work isn't barking up the wrong tree, it's not 
 even media work, it's not even really interactive,
 or it's simple interaction intended to disguise my 
 ignorance at any cost.
the only delight it brings is the usual confusion of the
 pieces but sometimes i err further and produce what 
 appears on the surface like a meditation but in fact is
 just a lengthy and stupid poverty of looping movement
 and ideas.
i can work myself to death that way and you'd be lucky
 if i did.
my mind stumbles in idiotic pursuit of intelligence.
this confession should suffice, please control your
 anger.
there's no reason to look at anything of mine again.

that's the end of the confessions; they're as boring 
as anything in my work.

the tamburi drone is off-interval for this, the
result is the death of music, music mourning
music, the slow eyelids fluttering against the
dying of the sound, the yearning for completion
always on the verge of disappearance, vanquished,
gone, please listen, enjoy,



the tunnel

from zero to anything you say / and you go down this tunnel and 
you watch and here they are. further down the stalk or sides, 
quantum tunnelings, phone calls, dilations, screams. you're in a 
dark tunnel and you dream you're in a dark tunnel. you agree to 
meet. you set a time, date, place, central bone-core, flesh 
shreds hanging organelles, dark tunnels, extremely tight, east, 
looks like the very squeeze. an eerie light, and dark the long 
tunnel, opening into tunnels, tendrils lost in one long shadow 
riding the harbor to the long long island, the long tunnel, 
mapping as it entered and left the mountains which seemed quite 
long. ... and tubes, shrouded in the tunnels, an urgent segment 
of frozen space, long, the long dark tunnel, long.

The music and the audience were great! The saxes
were amazing, Azure and I sounded good. But the
recording is terrible, too near the saxes and with
a strange standing-wave aligned with Azure's voice.
In any case you get an idea of an idea of an idea
of what we were doing and the saxes recorded
beautifully. Really bizarre!

before Chris and Jackson came. I was
"tuning up" and "unpacking." Last night
on Channel 11 Facebook was described
as extremely narcissistic so I thought
I should participate with pictures of 
me and Azure and I'm only sorry I don't
have pictures of Chris and Jackson too
or even the group that followed us 
because I was too wrapped up in tuning
and narcissism and unpacking.
