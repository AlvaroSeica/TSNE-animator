Parable of Zarathustra and Daishin Nikuko


Zarathustra sticks his long cock into me. He's got it easy; he's up on the
mountain as usual. Zarathustra, I say, you can't see anything from there. 

It's a big cock, bigger than usual. It's long and hard and I'm used to
that of course; it's designed as a tool or implement, something for Z. to
hang on to.

It's a tiny cock. I gnaw at its root. It's in and Z. doesn't have enough
blood to fill it. I open my vein, my artery, the channels of my heart. I
spill into him. I fill his cock and it gets bigger and harder.

It's not enough. I throw my heart into it, my bones into it. It gets big-
ger and harder. It gets big and hard. Now I take it in me, now it fills
me. I take the bones back.

I take the heart back and his heart too. I take the blood back and his
blood as well and why not his bones. Z.'s brain follows suit. There's
nothing left of him. There wasn't much to begin with, some parables.

Later, I'll let him out; he crawls from my asshole, another pleasure. 
He'll sow his dirt and call it Medusa. I knew her mother. 

Z., come down from the mountain, I say. It's cold up there and you can't
see a damn thing.
