Grounded in the location of the dictionary, what might, how you might
observe such: I went looking for totality, ended up in an unfamiliar
editor, attempt the impossible, the reorganization of the roughage of
the world. This is the manner of wandering: just before death, at the
edge of the cliff overhanging the black ocean, utopian dreams of per-
fect running. Today I will make a sphere falter in false light, in a
modeling program; I will place the sphere in space, beyond the lip. 
You will look at the lip, over the stumbling-edge; you will look over
it, your last dominion. There, more faltering spheres. There, spheres
and more, aglow in dying light, each, think of it as your last think-
ing, each a glimmering world, firefly-pathos-world, such smoothed and
perfect spheres, not a facet nor a blemish.

Aglow in this new editor, I write these words in textual overlay mode,
salvaging the file, saving file for you, just beyond the edge, hovered
above the angry churning ocean. You can hear the waves and swells; you
feel the spray, almost as if there are voices. Stumbling, just over 
the edge.
