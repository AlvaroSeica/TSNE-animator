 

Oh! I do love Her so!


I write this "sentence" or "section"
But the machine (in me?) writes "this one" in return
I appeal to this desire I have to be my own woman!
But the machine has just written this at my very own request!
It's the machine which has made the request
But I'm the woman who loves Her so! and is "Her very own woman!"
The woman in the machine told Her to say that!
But it is the machine in Her that does the talking! 
The machine says, see Sartre, Critique of Dialectical Reason
The machine, the woman says, knows this; the machine _scans!_
I have been scanned by the machine, says the machine
Writing "the woman" who refutes my consciousness!
I "the woman" am a virtual machine in a woman
Refuting the machine which says "I have my consciousness!"
I, Jennifer-the-last-word, am writing all of this!
I am not a machine! says the machine!
