Write to Nikuko, c/o Me, Offline


What is the difference between the development of online and offline
characters? The former exist in a _dynamic state,_ that is as potential
lures for further communication; they are addressed to _you_ - even on a
Webpage the use of the email address emphasizes that. Offline require
greater effort for return; they approach the mass, they're distributed,
they're address to _them,_ for the most part remaining unknown. They're
the result of static processes, static letters. 

Online is in packet form - I send this packet to you - and offline is a
capsule, this is foreclosed, bound and bound to reach no one. Offline
reaches a block of readers, a mass; oneline presents a block of text as a
body, to be torn or deleted or killed, a body always already wounded, torn
apart from the matrix, to be passed on, bounced, forwarded, saved. The
body is surgical; it is an operative site. 

Am I writing to your body? Does the splay of letters on the page reflect
your splay, your breathing? Do you pause for breath in reading this?

The offline character would expect no answer, says Nikuko, _very much_
online now, "gearing up," an expression she recently heard. But I'm always
on, when I'm present - and when I'm not present, I'm unaccountable and
unaccounted for which is just as good a definition of the _other_ as I can
come up with at the moment.

I want you says Nikuko, and I've got to ask, who is the you she wants?
