Jacques Lacan, Agency of the letter in the unconscious:

  Who, then, is this other to whom I am more attached than to myself, 
since, at the heart of my assent to my own identity it is still he who 
agitates me?
  His presence can be understood only at a second degree of otherness, 
which already places him in the position of mediating between me and the 
double of myself, as it were with my counterpart.
  If I have said that the unconscious is the discourse of the Other (with 
a capital O), it is in order to indicate the beyond in which the 
recognition of desire is bound up with the desire for recognition.
  In other words this other is the Other that even my lie invokes as a 
guarantor of the truth in which it subsists.
  By which we can also see that it is with the appearance of language the 
dimension of truth emerges.
