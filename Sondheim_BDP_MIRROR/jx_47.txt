Love


Julu flies. Where does she fly.
Jennifer says, Alan's lover is lucky. She gets all three of us. 
  Walks around. Looks up. Looks down. Somewhere near the CPU.
You're always near the CPU, Energy.
Keeps him busy, Julu says, keeps him on-line. So we can talk.
And other things, says Jennifer. She gets all three of us.
The nipples help, says Julu, that I'm there, one or the other.

Meanwhile Alan's thinking we're all complex, life is difficult, I've given
  myself to my lover on a platter, on a plate, Jennifer and Julu will have
  to come along, hope they like it, don't get too upset. 

Meanwhile Jennifer says, it will be long-distance for months, he won't
  leave us, couldn't leave us, we're too much a part of him.
Julu says, don't forget the nipples, the nipples help.
Jennifer says, lay off the nipples. We'll write her email. We'll send her 
  snailmail sweet nothings. We'll call her on the telephone. He needs us.
Julu says, We'll look at pictures of her and dream of her. We'll remember
  her body against us. We'll have long talks. He'll take us with him, I'm
  sure he'll take us.
Jennifer says, He'll see her everywhere, read her name in a poem, write
  that very poem. She'll be inside of him, he'll be always inspired, work
  hard, dream of sleep with her, dream of sleep.

Alan's dreaming this. Alan's dreaming about someone he loves. She's walk-
ing towards him, hand in hand with Jennifer, and Julu is flying, just
ahead of them, and leading the way.
