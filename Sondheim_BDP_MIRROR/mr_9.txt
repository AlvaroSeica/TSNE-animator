THE CLARA


http://www.asondheim.org/portal/clara

The economy of the special effects apparatus from the 1930s gives way to 
the digital; the digital isolates those moments of the image that speak 
all too easily, as if they weren't speaking at all.

The beautiful woman is isolated and framed by a device capable of addition 
or subtraction of the potential screen, the imaginary, positioned. The 
apparatus as in Godard displays itself, inhales/exhales the graphic-in- 
residence.

This is the smallest conceivable way to waylay the wayward viewer. One 
looks over the shoulder of the apparatus; hopefully the framing is still a 
long way off - the result clearly one of an infinite field of the social, 
of perception itself - or, in a sense, the inverse of the vanishing-point 
in perspectival configurations.

(The social reveals itself, an emblem.)
