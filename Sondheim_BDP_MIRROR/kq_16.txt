Some Questions Occasioned by Today's Talk


Is the Net surrounded by pedophiles? Are they taking over? Do pedophiles
run from online cops who chase pedophiles destroying our lovely communi-
ties while cybergods watch and read our email? Is the Net full of spies
inherited from bad-experience government trying to wing its military way
out of the cold war? Are we all other genders jammed full and ramrodded
with military intent? Are we fucked by capital while our children our
enslaved by right-wing demigods? Do the students I speak to want to know
this stuff? Are they brainwashed by netizens intent on corrupting sweet
young genitals through flamewars burning the pubic hair off of innocence?
Do we get increasingly depressed smelling our bodies as seared skin curls
around the lips puckering everywhere on extruded flesh and mouths? Have we
lost our real life friends as our blood oozes uncontrollably from tenta-
cles unraveling our last bitter dreams? Are we loners with concussions and
wounds dripping on shorted keyboards as we rage in impotence against war-
lords jacked in taking our last rites while we suck anything in sight as
desperate teats offer themselves in cybercash leather restraints? Are we
who we say we are? Are we who they say we are? What about our suppurating
cancers? My lips are split.
