'Don't be confused by surfaces; in the depth everything becomes law.'

							- Rilke

/if all the world is a text, what sort of text is it/
/if all the world is a text all the way down, what about the levels/
/can the obdurate be deconstructed/
/i say: these are not all relativisms: i say: there is work to be done/
/that there are fundamental structures/
/mathematizations/categories and topoi/core theories/dna codifications/
/conservations/
/but that it is a text: becomes discrete, loosely tethered/
/collusion of continuum and particulation/
/and but that the psychoanalytics of introjection, translation/
/projection, morphing: that science regroups as a _thing_/
/that there are _traces_/
