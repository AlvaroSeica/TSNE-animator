W has disappeared. It's storming out - unbelievable fury out there - 
shouldn't finish this - would there be more? Thunder's stuttering - 
unbearable violence - natural slaughter - "I wouldn't want to be out in 
this storm" - lightning's strong enough to read by - UPS holding nicely - 
in Pennsylvania, home of Thor - hope you like "what I've been able to do 
in such brief time" - honestly I would have worked more on this - can 
hardly hear myself think - lightning's just about on top of me - no, this 
won't end with the false strike - I'm just protecting the machinery - 
"it's my dad's machine" -

queen's writ


it's the queen's writ, to be sure, you can read it in the wind, it's 
graphology. god is a voiceover discerned by signs turned as such on the 
lathe of experience. we're heading towards the interior, mine own, squalls 
lead the way. the machines shudder in the almost-dark, you can hear the 
native clarinets murmured in the distance. all distances are great, saith 
the lord, all winds from nowhere, all destinations cut short by the love 
of death. the lord inculcates all i do and think. religion's always on my 
mind, when it isn't dad, and the two are identical, now aren't they. you 
can see the packet spurts, shape-riding in this environment is more like a 
roller-coaster than anything else, holy-roller to be sure. the wind blows 
out, grey clouds unfurl the sky once again in the almost-dark. this is the 
image of a picture in the text of the steganographic image. the terrorists 
need help. i'm in the valleys of the appalachians of pennsylvania, we're 
all in training here, but for what?:day two on dad's machines, the natives 
here are restless, we'll take care of it, get rid of the dirty bomb, 
literally, the earth throws it off-course, solar panels in disarray, 
mayday or some such, but who'd approach? not on your life they say, at 
least the machine works slow like a leak, word after word coming in, none 
too fast of course - there are winds on the sea, winds within, they caress 
me, dawn, there are winds on the sea, winds within, they caress me, dawn, 
you can read it in the wind

your there are masts in the land, masts in the sea, what of them and their 
brawn, your place among you

there are masts in the land, masts in the sea, what of them and their brawn
you can read it, you can read it in the wind

but it was something el-se


day turned to night when you went away
seemed like every day you had to play
but it was something el-se
but it was something el-se
times are hard, they're getting worse
daddy drove up in a big old hearse
but it was something el-se
but it was something el-se
souls are going and it won't be long
before they come and take this song
but it was something el-se
but it was something el-se
i can feel the storm it's coming tonight
the river's rising an awful sight
but it was something el-se
but it was something el-se
man came around he had a gun
said you ain't gonna vote this time my son
but it was something el-se
but it was something el-se
i ran like hell to another state
they're all filled now with sacred hate
but it was something el-se
but it was something el-se
god said son you're murderers all
bow down to me and you'll walk tall
but it was something el-se
but it was something el-se
you thank the lord you're still alive
to worship him and join the hive
but it was something el-se
but it was something el-se
my woman left we no goodbyes
i trust the lord to hear my cries
but it was something el-se
but it was something el-se
i killed my children for their sins
in a holy war now everyone wins
but it was something el-se
but it was something el-se
god played the fiddle devil the drum
you can't tell where they're coming from
but it was something el-se
but it was something el-se
ain't gonna vote the party of god
fuck the rapture the worship of sod
but it was something el-se
but it was something el-se
fuck the torah and koran too
fuck the sutras christ is through
but it was something el-se
but it was something el-se
my momma's gone to the setting son
i'm left alone i'm the only one
but it was something el-se
but it was something el-se
the only people jesus saves
lie dead and buried in black-mass graves
but it was something el-se
but it was something el-se
if you believe you're an enemy
of those who don't and as for me
it was something el-se
it was something el-se
if you don't believe you're an enemy
of those who do and as for me
it was something el-se
it was something el-se

the Recapitulation of NIKUKO


digital analog death of thousands corporeal
rather the blessing of the GOOD LORD
digital analog death of thousands corporeal
insanity everywhere in this world, among friends and
the covenant of the final remnant -
the digital is based on epistemology and uniformity
what the hell are we fighting for
hold the course and never swerve
now escape through others creatively
the analog mapping is analogy
impetus against the wall of writing from which i
our bombs will cut a deeper nerve
the digital is always doubly-encoded
bomb in fury without pity
the real is infinite raster
unbearable. sexuality became a furious
untethering the witnesses!
form is extruded raster
in freedom we'll destroy this city
violence and the tension is
coward, fearful of any
fuck them first and kill them later
the integral calculus inheres within the analog
freedom makes us all the greater
the differential calculus inheres within the digital
world. i still live there; i'm a
i can't go on this stupid rhyme
the darkness of the hurtling
the signature is analogous to the body
untethering languagings!
the digital and analog chiasmus at the limit
those lines are entirely effaced or
to work out the relations with my
among the leaders and disciples who can testify
genre. why didn't other people tell
the digital is simultaneously eternal and ephemeral
and who can sing the praises of resolute deity
no more! no more!
technology is the substructure of the digital
them. i didn't know better about
on above the cliffs or over
the technological substructure temporally splays and leaks
when nothing shall prevent catastrophe or disappearance
among the shuddering of not both this and that -
the analog is atemporal and time is analogical
when we were floating over the 
a sentence through every sentence
aimed his gun in my direction
we have been given wisdom and understanding
a world through every world
on the knife-blade edge of all disappearance -
virginity just about the time a soldier
cold and strung-out energy and matter -
fluid mechanics of the analog and mechanics of the digital
or sometime lost my
rather the blessing of the GOOD LORD
insanity everywhere in this world, among friends and
the covenant of the final remnant -
the digital is based on epistemology and uniformity
what the hell are we fighting for
nonfictionally. i've seen far too much
the blood will spill upon the hill
the digital is always already a mapping
bomb in fury without pity
the real is infinite raster
unbearable. sexuality became a furious
untethering the witnesses!
form is extruded raster
in freedom we'll destroy this city
violence and the tension is
coward, fearful of any
fuck them first and kill them later
