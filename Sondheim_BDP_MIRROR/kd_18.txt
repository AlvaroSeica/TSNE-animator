SONG FOR EMPEROR JIMMU


Come on, my boys!
Come on, my boys!
Let the arrows hail!
Let the arrows hail!
"Let us smite them utterly!"
"Let us smite them utterly!"

Oh boys, let's go!
Oh boys, let's go!
Let us dance around the kami!
Let us dance around the jinja!
Let us traverse their scapula!
Let us traverse their scapula!

Oh boys, let's cut them utterly!
Oh boys, let's cut them utterly!
Let's cut them down and up!
Let's cut them up and down!
Oh boys, let the arrows hail!
Oh boys, let the stones pound away!
Oh boys, let's pound away the stone!

Now, ha ha!
Now, hai hai!
"Let us pound them utterly!"
"Let us cut them utterly!"
Let the birds fly away!
Let the beasts fly afield!
Let them fly utterly!
"Let us let them fly utterly!"

Smite them, boys!
Don't let them fly utterly!
Don't let them pound utterly!
Don't let them cut utterly!
Smite them, boys!
Don't let them dance utterly!
Utterly smite them!
Utterly smite them!

Don't let them pound!
Don't let them!
Don't let them pound!
Don't let them!
Utterly smite them!
Cut them!
Utterly smite them!
Cut them!
Don't let them fly utterly!
