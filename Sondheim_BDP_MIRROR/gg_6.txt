Mornings, Whining


Mornings are the worst; it's the mornings that don't let me forget any-
thing. They come in from the dreaming of the night, over which I have no
control. The day begins with evening for me; the afternoons are an inter-
val to get through, half asleep, exhausted. If I nap, I succumb; it's a
shorter wait.

Mornings carry the debris from other lives; I awake with cold bed whispers
in my ear. Death stalks me in the mornings, stalks me all day, but the
thing disappears when the sun or storm-clouds rise in the murmuring sky.
Tears disappear. I'm almost human. Maybe.

The keyboard (image now at my URL) faces the bed; instead of potential, it
rasps with cleansings of all sorts, breaking down the Inbox, putting it
aside for a few hours. The stale day unfurls its maroon hours against me,
suffocating or drowning the body. The body's gone on too long. CuSeeMe is
a betrayal.

Stalking death mute is the way to go. Nothing ever drops from the sky. I
keep mentioning the sky. The sky is an out. I stand on the ledge and flap
myself. I'll never fall.

I wait like a mad dog by the Inbox, foaming at the mouth, for a perfect
message which doesn't arrive. I read Goffman's Stigma maybe or Asma El
Dareer's Woman, Why Do you Weep? Circumcision and Its Consequences, or
maybe Life Against Death again. Everywhere but here, bodies are torn apart
or dismembered. No one likes the mutilations. I imagine a bunch of guys
standing around a bar, drinking like crazy. They're happy fellows.

Maybe I can find them on the Net.
