the promise

i am very small in the world
i have tried to make peace with the world
i constitute and reconstitute myself
i have tried to make peace with my father
i am barred from the world and my father
in the next quarter century i will write
i will complete the work i have been writing
i will compile and interpret the work
the work will remain in spite of its ruin
in the stories of mothers and sons i am written
in the stories of fathers and sons i am written
i am a coward small and fearful
in this world i will write not a world
from not a world for decades i will write
i will write pebbles and endless beaches
i will walk on edges and fly low near a height
i shall ascertain the heights of men and women
i will reckon and live through reckonings
i will promise and live through promisings
in ruins i will stumble and write of ruins
among friends and enemies i will testify
shore and beaches and pebbles are memories
of nights and days i will write their turnings
i am fearful of worlds and will never write worlds
i am fearful of worlds and i will write worlds
this promise of the 6th day 10th month 99th year
when i am smallest in this smallest of worlds


The Truth


Voulez vous que verte vous die?
Il n'est jouer qu'en maladie,
Lettre vraye que tragedie,
Lasche homme que chevalereux,
Orrible son que melodie,
Ne bien conseille qu'amoureuz.

You want the truth from me?
There is no joy except in sickness,
nor truth outside the theater,
nor coward like a knightly man,
nor grimmer sound than melody,
nor wisdom save from those in love.

- Francois Villon by way of Anthony Bonner by way of Jennifer, or 
- Alan Sondheim by way of Jennifer's Bonner's Villon
