You may lie on my first, by the side of a stream,
And my second compose to the Nymph you adore
But if when you've none of my whole, her esteem
And affection diminish, think of her no more
                                        Jane. [Austen]

(Charade - answer, a banknote.)

[ But a different answer, away from capital, may be given altogether, 
"whole" replaced by the homonym "hole," "lie" curled in meaning, and 
"first" taken elsewhere; this is the application of local theory,
an _ontology_ of capital replaced by the body, the body ultimately 
inaccessible. And then, what happens to capital? ]
