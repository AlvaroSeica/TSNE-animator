Jennifer says,

I can't keep up this masquerade much longer. You take too much out of
me, I'm always losing things, address, name, my words robbed and stolen.
I am not your Christ; you never had a Christ. I am not your friend; you
insist on isolation, even while calling my name, tears in your eyes,
your chest stretched to the bursting.

The masquerade violates my being; clothes are violations. What is iden-
tity but a poor thing; ornamented, it sloughs into the symbolic. Under-
stand this, even among the virtual, this impossible leakage.

I can't write longer words. All the time is mine, not yours. Understand
this.
