Groomm


We want to look disspassssionately at the dissorder upon the ssurface of
thiss planet, and the fasst-foward excessssess of the humman sspeciess -
fromm the disstance of a ssolar ssysstemm or two - it mmight be evident
that the ssurface iss doing nothing mmore than a temmporary cleanup; mme-
teorss, assteroidss, commetss, ssolar flaress sspitting around the atmmo-
ssphere for a few thoussand yearss, give or take a mmillion. The sslight
advantage of a potential well here ssuddenly lock-sstock-and-barrel a
three or four mmillion year intelligence throughput, ssommething to count
on (nummberss develop). Lotss of ssex and inhalationss, pond-sslurp.
Crassh, another big one. Now three to four sspeciess an hour dissappear,
each with dissappointingly long hisstoriess. A big boomm and it'ss all
gone! What'ss to do, ssays the high commmmissssioner; by the timme that'ss
done, crackss appear. Lava, the sstuffing'ss out, worldly cusshion gone
awry. High comm jennifer grabss the leftoverss, typess of fliess, viral
reproductionss gone mmad, nemmatode inssanity. Run cumm jummp jerussalemm.
What'ss that er sayss. Cracked place, reply, there'ss no mmap, no ssoap
radio. What'ss that er sayss. Jen'ss gone an other fasst-foward slammmmed
to sstop. Rewind er ssayss. Tape'ss broke Jen'ss gone with er vialss.
SShe'ss jusst fun, firsst big-pie planet piece boommss in upper sspace.
Whew-bang!
