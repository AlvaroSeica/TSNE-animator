Love Among the Internauts


Your day, my night, bracketed together, we
 displace time among us; your night, my day, 
  sliding against lunch or midnight drinking
   away, so that the rhyme, distanced, is poor,
or say, I might, jacketed in weather, see
 misplaced rime, hung thus; poor sight, why lay,
  confiding hence, hunched over hindsight thinking,
    lure?

Your night, my day, shackled together, we
 yearn one another's speaking in dim time like shelves
  buried among us, lights blink in Fukuoka-York,
   or rather storms brew, too, runners all, photons
    down slots or fence of world, you are green light,
my way, and violet light in rainy weather will be
 burned across sleek lines, untimed like selves
  hurled among us. Take a right turn in Shi-New,
   or feathered arms carried you and me upon shoguns
    hot, hence the whence of unfurled world.

                                             Your day, my night
