some things on the music */[...]/*

i or so

avoidance of noise ,then how to schedule fury or furious ,how to 
subtend silence */how to breathe ,how to subtend breathing/*

i don't want this thinking: that this is exploring instrument, 
instrumentality ,nor a field ,subtended by fingers or mouth ,no 
more than body

but the joist of particle physics ,muons on a sense of virtual 
particles on another

(a b) (a, b) (a / b) (a : b) (a | b) (a f(a, b) b)

it is all resonance ,surprising ,metallic overtones ,ringing: i 
remember just several sounds slowed into what seemed right even 
then

*/thinking among unthinking ,something about emptiness ,but 
something about thrust and elimination ,the tube ,the platform/*

foreign names touched by cultural illiteracy ,materials ,soundings,
emptied virtuosities

stringed, it is stringing ,perfect tautness ,resistance of 
parallel field ,tension of endpoint separation ,tension of 
separation */tension of aspiration ,breath-length ,incomplete 
phrasing/*

i do not want to duplicate this ,i do not want to duplicate an 
other

*/i wanna be an other ,i dont wanna be an other other ,i wanna 
be hir ,i wanna be hir breathe/*

something informing ,hypnagogic as if you might dream this ,an 
other or dream an other this */i wanna breathe hir/*

but not tiring ,tirade ,more of a space of a sounding or what 
might be 'some of a sound' */i dont wanna tirade ,now too much 
violence everywhere, wanna something else/*

of mewling ,howling ,whimpering ,murmuring ,seething ,then this amazing
release

neither to be where you have been nor will have gone there ,here is 
one alone ,playing music ,playing music together

tending the wood ,nylon ,skin ,metal ,plastic ,catgut ,horsehair 
,wax, bamboo ,bone ,or tending the wires */tending the reed ,the 
silk ,sub-tending the air within ,thinned line among these/*

the absence of metaphor ,wires ,no paralleling ,the difficulty
of absence ,no equivalence ,no identity ,just as everything else is,
or remains ,inert

sound of the obdurate ,sound of the inert

ii or so

learning to play these ,evenings or nights' mornings ,but with 
all respect ,coaxing ,no world music ,no world but what ,are we 
brought, to */,but what world has brought us/*

here's an idea ,so i'll do it ,hear what happens ,when new ,then 
so it is brought */,then so it is given/*

always writing in silence ,always playing in silence ,playing 
silence, listening silence ,enormous roiling ,slow extinction of 
the planet, these last sounds ,instrument making ,them

she got up from the music ,he got down to the music,
he got up from the music ,she got down to the music

you'll be telling me specifically what you want to know,
i'll be telling you specifically what you want to know

allowing myself the courtesy of being-deaf, 
allowing yourself my fingering you ,of being-sound & of mind & body

listing ,yayli tanbur ,ukulele ,cobza ,hasapi ,cura cumbus 
,hegelung, rababa ,electric saz ,valveless chromatic harmonica 
,parlor guitar, classical guitar ,alpine prime zither ,alpine 
elegy zither ,like the emptying of names */listening to others 
,fast-forward changing instrumentation/*

unknown on my fault ,something else of shameful ,refusing 
abjection in the moment when nail and steel ,flesh and wood 
,collide

unknown ,everywhere i look ,unknown

iii or so

i'm not giving you what you want ,that is ,an entry into this 
sound, some of an anecdote ,or at the very least, an explanation 
,as in, 'you owe me an explanation' */or you owe me nothing ,or 
you begin ,just now ,to owe everything ,you owe nothing to me/*

i wouldn't know how to begin ,perhaps in eternal sorrow 
,mourning, every minute of the life ,or the slightest peaks of 
joy ,or stories about failure quantum-tunneled into music of 
unutterable beauty ,or musics

or something about how these instruments came about ,what do i 
know of their arrival ,or this i know ,their attraction for me 
,sounding of the world through them ,fretless ,they are teaching 
me how to listen ,place each finger in its rough exactitude 
*/,watch the finger travel/*

or fretted in narrowed intervals ,what might be ,for others ,or 
those places of others ,a difference in any world ,or numbers of 
worlds ,worlds without number ,over and over again, desperately 
listening ,listening ,as if something might come about, occur 
,just by the sheer force of it

or the slow sweep of the bow as left hand fumbles for tone or tune,
begins its slower repetition ,*/[...]/*savoring

iv or so

it is more you want ,more you ever want ,this savagery ,this 
lack of mine ,of yours ,one more word ,phrase ,sound or tune 
,book or text, of book and of sound ,of tune and of text ,that 
will do it ,completion, or suturing ,the fullness of the world 
,fecundity, repleteness, lathering ,or foam of planck mass 
,length ,time ,of vacuum and an energy ,of particle and fray 
*/,too much physics ,unthinking ,what this has to do with it 
,revrev and anticipatory architectures ,philosophy and 
archeology of hope/*

this savagery a savagery ,silence a quiescence, calmness ,the 
piercing ,of things ,of some things ,on the music ,on the music

drove across us providence to omaha 23 1/2 hours 
we were up for 38 hours, now playing clarinet to
bluejays gathered around the porch between thunder
storms to listen to my own personal ornithology
this time they're enveloped in silence & admiration
i was so well pleased at the enjoyment promised to
come back for more & they were so well pleased

Delivering Missouri

the instruments delivered to the National Music Museum
in Vermillion, South Dakota; we donated these unique and
delicate objects, and it was wonderful to sense the
humidity/temperature controlled environment, necessary
for their preservation.

http://www.alansondheim.org/nmm04.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/nmm06.jpg

a few days ago, by the banks of the wandering, sinuous,
sandbanked, debris-gathering, Missouri River, with signs
of the encroaching rigidity of civilization and 
parceling out the rigor of surveying and flood control

http://www.alansondheim.org/missouri.mp4

we were traveling at 70 mph, well below the speed limit,
a grackle started to fly into the car, I braked, the 
bird hit on the left rounded hood surface, the sound was
terrible, the first time for me, the bird disappeared, 
no trace, perhaps stunned somewhere, perhaps flown off,
perhaps broken

the cars don't belong on the road

their encroaching rigidity

we brought the instruments to the National Music Museum
in Vermillion, South Dakota

http://www.alansondheim.org/councilbluffed.mp4

Images of a Ladakhi flute, given to me by Fred Lieberman, an 
ethnomusicologist and qin expert. The flute is constructed with 
reed, tar, and duct tape, and has an architecture similar to 
Native American flutes (see the Wikipedia article on the 
subject). Lieberman speculated there was a historic cultural 
relationship between the two groups. I had an Albert System C 
clarinet - this was decades ago - and I gave it to him; he 
wanted to play klezmer, and we were friends. In return, he gave 
me the Ladakhi instrument as a gift; he said he had gotten it in 
Ladakh. I remember all of this poorly, and am fascinated by the 
potential musical parallels between the Native American regions 
and Ladakh. I hope the National Music Museum will research this. 
And how accurate is my memory of his recounting, after so many 
years? (I had to keep the flute refrigerated, by the way so that 
the tar would retain its shape.)

The video is a collection of still images I shot at the museum - 
instruments I was interested in, as well as some establishment 
shots.

On the way to and from Vermillion on Route 29, we noticed dead 
trees on the western side of the road, near the Missouri River; 
this is likely the result of flooding a couple of years ago. The 
eastern side was going through the usual spring budding. All of 
this near Council Bluffs with its cylindrical iron jail; hence 
the title of the video.

We're a block from the Gerald Ford Birthplace,
Betty Ford Danced with Martha Graham, perhaps 
there's a photograph in my Barbara Morgan book?
These images are from the birthplace and park.
I think about the prairie and Lee Murray has
given me an old 10-hole Hohner Chromonica in G
and I make believe I am a prairie.

I recognize this will stop soon enough when we
return to dark and medieval Providence where 
the streets are paved.

Johannes Birringer and I are next to each other
in the forthcoming issue of VLAK.

I forgot to mention the streets are paved here 
in Omaha, I didn't mean to imply otherwise. And
today I came close to another episode of
depression. I exist by rereading Hermann Weyl's
Symmetry with the full hope I turn back again.

I cannot imagine a man.

And Betty Ford? She's marvelous.

Surge


working on the Surge article

Surge is the overthrowing of all values, ideologies, and structures.
It is the absolute overthrowing of all histories, privacies, persons.
It is the total extinction of all species, including our own.
It is the scorching of the scorching of the earth.
Let's talk about this. Let's build around the surge.
Let's build around the dying and absolute annihilation. Let's do it.

around a dam adjacent to Morgantown. we were
told the Army Corps of Engineers operated the
facility, but declined cleanup, that it wasn't
their responsibility. the trash apparently
finds its way down the Mississippi. we have no
idea if this is true or not, but the river
in this part of WV is a mess. we'd appreciate
any information anyone might have about the 
situation; it's been the same ever since we've 
been coming to Morgantown.

Surge compendium


Proceed.

http://www.alansondheim.org/0000.jpg

"Surge is the overthrowing of all values, ideologies, and 
structures. It is the absolute overthrowing of all histories, 
privacies, persons. It is the total extinction of all species, 
including our own. It is the scorching of the scorching of the 
earth. Let's talk about this. Let's build around the Surge. 
Let's build around the dying and absolute annihilation. Let's do 
it." (ca 2015)

Proceed.
A pixel is a digital object.
Between one pixel and another, there is annihilation.
Annihilation seethes.
There is nothing else but an epistemology of demarcated 
positions and ontology.
Post-digital is digital; post-digital has equivalent 
epistemology.
A digital object is substrate-dependent.
The substrate is an object and from this we adduce strata and 
structures of digital objects.
Proceed.
The Surge is just that, the Surge of digital objects and 
substrates, replacing everything in the world.
Annihilation is the potential for transformation of everything 
in the world.
Annihilation to the limit is extinction.
Abjection and truth are intertwined.
Abjection and truth inhabit the substrate.
The digital object is a mapping of its substrate and its 
substrate is subject to replacement, duplication, reassignment 
and other transformations.
The substrate is a moment of the digital object.
The entanglement of truth and abjection within the substrate is 
within a continuous state of annihilation and potential wells.
The digital object is an object of reading; the substrate is a 
surface of writing. 
The Surge loads substrates with digital objects.
Proceed.
The Surge replaces objects with digital objects.
Aura is always an entangled raster.
The Surge replaces aura with increasingly fine rasters.
Rasters are inscriptions and demarcations.
One might say that rasters are inscriptions within the 
metaphysical, that substrates possess no rasters, that mapping 
is from raster to substrate.
The digital object is a choice.
The digital object may be a choice of a substrate object.
If a substrate object is chosen or not chosen, it will be 
scorched.
If a substrate object is chosen, it may be inscribed.
The inscription of a substrate object is not a substrate object.
The inscription of a body is not a body.
The inscription of a body may inhere within the body, and may be 
entangled within the body.
The substrate of an inhered inscription is within states of 
annihilation and potential wells.
The digital object neither exhausts physical objects nor its 
substrate.
The digital object is an insertion into protocol farms and 
networks, including translations fundamentally based on the 
employment of process and power; to the extent that the digital 
object functions as an insertion, it is subject to movements 
across substrates.
Proceed.
The digital object is en garde. 
The digital object is an instance.
The scorched earth of the scorched earth is annihilation to the 
limit and the elimination of the instance.
Reproduction of digital objects is finite.
A reproduction machine itself may be reproduced.
At the heart of the reproduction machine, at the heart of any 
object, digital or otherwise, is annihilation.
Annihilation inhabits the absolute, and the desire for absolute 
annihilation constructs the scorched earth of the scorched 
earth.
Proceed.
The Surge constructs a new earth, new habitus, new environment.
One cannot turn back, one cannot return, from the Surge.
The fundamental characteristic of the Surge, at this point, is 
the simultaneous recuperation of every history, every culture, 
every text, and the annihilation of every history, every 
culture, every text.
The simulacrum of recuperation is a simulacrum.
Simulacra are simultaneously recuperated and annihilated. 
The Surge proceeds from fundamental annihilation.
The Surge is simultaneously the relativization of the world, and 
its absolute. 
Proceed.
The Surge is violation fabric; on the nub of the Surge, we bear 
witness to annihilation.
Proceed.
It is not even a matter of time.
It is not even a matter of bearing witness.
There are no matters of which 'it is a matter.'
Proceed.
The _mob_ of the Surge.
Proceed.
The _overwhelming_ of the world, of any other world.
Uselessness and annihilation of philosophies.
Proceed.
