Travis wrote to her. The time and return was .465 seconds on average, not
bad when Fukuoka had been considered the center of the world in the four-
teenth century, his own hometown unknown, fallow, untended. He was aware
of the gaping maw of the sun, violent lunacy of the swinging moon which
rarely showed its face - from its night, the radiance of her day showed
forth. Mesmeric, he adapted himself to her schedule, his sun-up suppers
with his friends were the occasion of back-channel conversations about
sanity and the diameter of the earth. He joked he was the only one aware
of circumference, of what a sphere was and meant - that he was the only
one earth-bound, everyone else walking with stitched eyes and habits
formed from childhood. He knew the sphere of stars and its awkwardness,
how it shuddered above and below the equator, the rings of luminescent
star-clouds and their satellites, give and take of unknown constellations.

But it was his doubling that fascinated him, breakfast as dusk rose, not
dawn, sleeping at odd hours reflecting gaps and silences, and his Monday
night class that began oddly enough on Tuesday morning at seven - he re-
mained surprised that the students were alert, keen on the speed of the
Net, which should have been accountably slow and clumsy.

His clocks gained a minute, lost a minute. He tried to meet himself half-
way, like a friend. His nights were bright with untoward clarity, unthun-
dered days, dark, uncanny, silent. Someone fixed the stars, he thought,
they were never when they were supposed to be. 

She wrote him about the llamas.
