Lag


Lag killed it. I can't think anymore. Time zero is time smeared. 
Anyone can have me. No one can reach me.
I come cheap. I don't come at all. I'm next to you.
I'm inaccessible.
Inside my mind: nothing.
Lag is a nipple. Milk me.
There isn't any. Lag-crack. Hold my breasts.
My holes are vases for your flowers for your fingers.
I slam into the earth at one hundred sixty five miles an hour.
I don't slam at all. Time zero is unmeasured. Stoned cold.
Inside me: nothing. Lag kills.
When you are there I am not there.
