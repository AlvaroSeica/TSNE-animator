Long Saz Form reworked

http://lounge.espdisk.com/archives/1101 (best)
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/longsazform.mp3

yes, in capitals, remaking the piece with the 
microphones near the sound-hole door, less 
buzzing, better quality, almost angelic in its
beauty, i'm very happy with this instrument. 
so this is a new piece of the angelic order:

" all the way from one site to another, 
angelic hosts playing tears of speech or 
phenomena, o angelic absolutions...

" not-i not-don't not-know not-the not-angelic. 
not-i not-don't not-know the darkness and despair,
that dark blueblue of the angelic sky...

" o angelic orders your streamers descend your streams
universal plasma is never angelic
  o angelic orders your streamers descend your streams
universal plasma is never angelic

" and the _third_ lends itself to the angelic, 
flight above, o angelic sky,\ stopped, then, day, 
clear summer cool, animals, dirt, and the
 
" angelic world of elegies, we were transported
  angelic world of elegies, we were transported"

- Chris Diasparra tenor sax -
- Alan Sondheim electric saz electric pipa cura -

my faults - Chris should have been recorded louder!
I should have listened more carefully instead of rushing!
I shouldn't have filled every vacancy with more flurries!
I should have more carefully adjusted my playing!
Years ago I should have learned how to sing!
Chris plays beautifully here, long yearning lines:
I should have listened! I could have been a musician!

enjoy!

[11:46] Julu Twine is online.
[11:46] Flight Band: All Go
[11:46] Julu Twine: I think of the dance as a whirl without consent, like 
the body burning, or

 like a singer without a song, totally open to the world, no computer,

    I think of an inverted hysteria, the world as symptom of this



 it wobbles on pivots, it gyres on axes, it twists

and turns,

 it turns away the face, the face of the world is the dance





the world of the face is the trance





I think the hands hold old-fashioned canes and crushes these could be

                  quite dangerous wobble turn around





I think you leave holding hands





my heart

bursts open
