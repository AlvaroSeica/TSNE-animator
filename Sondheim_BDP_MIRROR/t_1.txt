On my Birth-Night



It's my birth-night, approaching birth-hour, birth-minute. I read in Jabes:



           There is no thought without body.  Where I speak,
        where I am silent, my body is the body of my thought.
           "Ah, the wound is deeper than we tend to believe,
        never completely visible," wrote Reb Souery.
