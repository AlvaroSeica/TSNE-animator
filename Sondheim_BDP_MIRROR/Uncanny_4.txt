Port @Create


Port 1 for my place in the universe, daughter of God, #0, all that there
is, a modicum of responsibility lax, being male shooting my penis into the
starts,

Port 2 for receiving, beginnings of nodes without ends, having found #0 
goddess who permits me to go on, jumping to 

Port 3 for wizardry, empathetic simulacra of humankind, animals and 
plants, rare minerals, spicules of sea urchins sharpened as composite 
animacules, inordinate jaw-lanterns chawing down, lipped vulva vivacious

Port 25 I send you mail beloved 2, under the aegis of #0, only through 
means of abstract averaging am I permitted to emerge into existence, 01, 
02, 03, o o!

Port 20-21 you have brought unto me the presence of bot-like objects, 
sacred texts, files and transferred, my penis wraps my eyes, spaces of 
all sorts, sparring masts challenging fires of St-Elmo in the midst of 
the Great Sea come to you

Port 23, I come to you, come to my own, telnet across the galazia of your
creation #0, but I won't begin the story, I won't begin to tunnel through

Port 80 on my way to 3, on my way back to you, too many things already to 
devour to modify to encapsulate, better return to the transgression of 
numerical citings 2 3 4 5 6,

Port 7777 returning from excursion, this is what I have found, etc., this 
is what I have brought you:

"And how prodigal, if I may so say, hath Nature been to furnish the Coun-
trey with all sorts of wilde Beasts and Fowle, which every one hath an
interest in, and may hunt at his pleasure; where besides the pleasure in
hunting, he may furnish his house with excellent fat Venison, Turkies,
Geese, Heath-Hens, Cranes, Swans, Ducks, Pidgeons, and the like: and
wearied with that"
