L'Etranger


He didn't appear crazy or homeless or within any other urban category. He
always stood there, outside, an Algerian or Egyptian, I believed, doing
nothing, either against the wall of the unemployment office or within the
subway. The nothing included tics, vocal mannerisms, smiles, gestures of
any sorts; his eyes followed no one, looking neither in nor out, hardly
blank. He would stand in spaces neither liminal nor central, focal; he
placed himself or was placed nowhere at all. His dress was nondescript. 
He refused both the name and the cipher, and never appeared to be waiting,
either for someone else or for drugs or other _materiel._ He did not exist
as _neither_ nor as presence nor absence; he was there without presence,
but without its absence as well. There was nothing that was was nothing
and there was something that was something and nothing as well. But it was
never interstitial, nor was there time. 

Because there was no time, there was the occurrence, continuous, and you
can find him now still present at Pacific Street and Fifth Avenue in the
Borough of Brooklyn in the City of New York in the state of the same name
in the totality of the United States of America north, just beneath Canada
against any sort of weather. You can find him near the unemployment of-
fice, but it is clear that he has no _relation_ to it whatsoever, never
entering nor leaving it, nor speaking to the people who enter or leave it,
or simply pass it by. You can find him on the stairs of the subway, or 
just in the vicinity of the turnstiles, but standing not so as to see 
down the subway corridor itself or to wait for anyone; you can find him 
at the base of the stairs, near one wall across from which is another, 
and nothing else but something which is the space between. You can find 
him nowhere else but most of the time you could find him.
