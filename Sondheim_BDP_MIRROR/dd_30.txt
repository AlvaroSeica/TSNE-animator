Labor


It's too much labor. There's labor everywhere on the Net, every instance
of text has thought and action behind it. Strands trace back from T1 lines
to teletype and earlier; totality is the result of production. The _shape_
of ASCII has been a decision, the result of conference and implementation. 
These fingers on these keys, interrupts all the way down. Subroutines call
up subroutines; there is no longer a level at the top, but only circula-
tion, some of which is evidenced as interface. Interface itself becomes
introjected; before long, the circulations will involve a totality which
is the result of production. The _shape_ of the world has been a decision,
the result of conference and implementation. This mind, interrupts all the
way down. Diffused subroutines, no longer localized, circulate among them-
selves; we're ensured that vision, somewhere, exists. No longer introjec- 
tion, the world, a result of production, continues as always.
