bluntness, dulled texts in cyberspace
muted, almost inaudible

imagine the letters smaller, maybe, blurred

i want to drink to take the edge off things
i want to write to take the edge off things

look, i'm murmuring to you. closer, you hear :
everything

it's as if something came into the light
it's as if the sound of a tiny bell came into the light
knowing where everything is

tracing the sound of the wound in complex realspace
texts muted in cyberspace

mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
not a grating, you

(rang from his cock wherever he was in the house)
(rang from her clit whenever she was in the house)

truth or not, couldn't get away from the writing
swollen beast

dumb split : split dumb
