the lake                              /*as if contained*/

talking in the middle of the world    /*waters and no shores*/
the motivation of a sail              /*none, none*/ 
perfect balancing where worlds        /*among forces*/
 breathe in worlds,                   /*breathing winds*/
delicate among elements               /*air, water contrail*/

what, happening, since beginnings     /*of universes, chaos*/
 making us human                      /*muteness of nature*/
taking us away                        /*rapture, travel, death*/
