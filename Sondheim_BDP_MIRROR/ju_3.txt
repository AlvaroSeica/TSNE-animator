Julu and Jennifer 


Think of Jennifer-Julu, Julu-Jennifer as system resonances, interferences
or viruses occasioned by intervention. Their psychoanalytics tangles on
and off the Net - as strange attractors, they shape discursive forma-
tions, nodes of theoretical focus. Similar to "deconstruction" (Derrida's
Letter to a Japanese Friend"), Jennifer and Julu fissure as contested
sites, split or sputter across applications, networks, texts. Subject and
body are at stake, problematized through the specificities of unfocused
language (body-html for example). Now, with local linux, Julu and Jenni-
fer have accounts, occur as intrasystem actants, communicating as well 
with my non-local ISP and the Net. Below, sendmail once again.

( What interests me here is the system calling itself, either directly or 
through the shell, looping back through Panix, avatars at both ends of 
the vector (community nowhere, messages spit into cyberspace, displayed
through xterm cut-and-paste). )
