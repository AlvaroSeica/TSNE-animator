Bone

It feels as if my bones will crack. my bones feel it in my wrist bones
that will crack will break, twist sinew tendon muscle, arm bones crack
into shoulder boned cracked or fissured. I hear splitting; there are tiny
cracks finger cracks hairline fractures, maw gaped fissures, filigree
cracks, bored bone split or splintered from palm to neck crack broken bone
palm slammed shattered torn cracked bone. Now a new day and just the hand
back heated from nothing snuffling around beneath the surface, fingers
recovered from crack-attacks, key stumbling once again, dark sun out
bright light.
