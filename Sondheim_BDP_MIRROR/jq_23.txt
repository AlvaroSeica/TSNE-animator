Sighn


Nothing remains beneath the signifier. Capital, gender, power, class, vio-
lence: all are dissolute, fragmented; these narratives gnaw at the social
fabric. Nor is it true that such form a determinate holarchic skein; the
nearly-severed superstructural components constructed in the realm of
classical physics are interrelated percolations. What seethes is capable
of imminent decathecting, defuge; the center no longer holds because pop-
ulations and technologies have exploded the concept.

Wild theory gathers the pieces, wild theories notwithstanding; one insists
in the main on the Occam's short-circuiting principles in spite of manner-
ist conspiracy tales. Nothing works write or right; what works is isolate. 
The chip-development clean-room becomes the transformative dream: to be
_perfect,_ cleansed of gender and culture, open to the hypothesis of pure
spirit. Art's modernist employment of clean white spaces/venues sufficed
for a limited population, until it fell like a soviet statue, overburdened
by its own historicity. 

It's to be forgotten that the clean-rooms are housed; that there are sub-
structures, broken as well, dating from the early decades of technological
urbanization. Floors cave in, ceilings leak, walls stain. We're in Residue 
Planet. There are no roads or roadsigns; there are stained-signs, caved-
signs, leaked-signs. There's no way out of town.
