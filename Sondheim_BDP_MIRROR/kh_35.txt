This Parable


"How does the directing mind treat itself? Everything depends on that.
The rest, whether objects of your choice or not, are all dead bodies and
smoke." (Marcus Aurelius, trans. Grube)

Yes, that is certainly the case. For there is landscape-debris, those dark
tombs with their five elements, stones worn to illegibility degree-zero.
The mind forks across weathered crevices; lightning-cracks open up through
ruined kanji. One might note blacks or dark-greys, even in the brightest
sun; they're lunar rocks, holding daimyos and retainers, princesses smoth-
ered for false crimes, remains of those who, like smoke, roam without mas-
ters across landscapes sulking with moist heat.

Dead bodies rise through smoke; smoking bodies die. Like a vector seared
across landscapes calked with burned debris, Nikuko will walk in directing-
mind-state, will speak with purpose, will box desire, will be futile. She
will be futile, meandering with purpose, hair on fire, eyes cowering daily
debris and powdered grey skin.

Nikuko will wake from directing-mind-dream, which will be Nikuko. Daishin
Nikuko, of the larger god or goddess, swarms of them, will be her name.
She will collect larger-minds, she will never speak of births and deaths.
I won't speak of mine in particular, said Daishin Nikuko, because purpose
would then be met. I will have none of that, she said. I will be futile.
