In real-life, I've had few voyeuristic experiences. There was a woman who,
years ago, would undress and stand naked in the window across the street
from me (not here). When I came into the apartment, I would glance out; if
she were there, I began trembling... 

A woman and I in Copenhagan, making love in an empty apartment (no furni-
ture), a man in an alcove above, another building, watching.

In the show, all of these feelings and intense sensations get confused for
the most part with pornographic display. I think the secrecy is critical; 
it couples with transgression, and the possibilities of a whole world of
subterranean desire, just beneath one's fingers, on the shutter of a cam-
era, peering behind a curtain, displaying oneself as if one were uncon-
scious of others opening, openings...
