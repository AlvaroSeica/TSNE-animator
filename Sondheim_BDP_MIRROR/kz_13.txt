    It's Funny

   
    You do tell me, says Nikuko, smiling, that existence has been   
    defeated, that a white horse is not a horse. 
    But existence, says Julu, smiling as well, do tell, it is not a 
    thing pleasured for defeat, it is a condition of what may be 
    defeated.
    It breaks, says Nikuko, chortling, on a white horse which is not 
    a horse, it breaks upon incommensurate commonalities!
    It breaks, replies Julu, chuckling, because it is not a natural 
    kind, because nouned or verbed, it is broken as the ontological 
    function of all possible worlds.
    Or rather, laughed Nikuko, it breaks precisely because what is
    broken is a natural kind, splintered from the edge to the center,
    splintered from the center to the edge.
    Julu was giggling now, you're saying the function is not copular!
    Yes, replied Nikuko, hardly able to restrain herself, there's no
    copula involved at all; it's inert, particulated - and still it
    breaks, because of the white horse!
    The white horse which is not a horse! said Julu, rolling around on
    the ground.
    It's not even white! gagged Nikuko, completely out of control!
    Hardly a horse at all! screamed Julu, completely out of breath!
    Neigh, Neigh, and that was the end of it!
