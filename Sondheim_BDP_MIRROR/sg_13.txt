Hi Sandy,

Odd working on this and re: my mother; my father's in the 
hospital at the moment and my brother and I have been talking 
about his death, although he may well live for several more 
years... It's a harrowing time.

I'm twisted re: my father, as you can well imagine, not in all 
that great shape... (Alan)
