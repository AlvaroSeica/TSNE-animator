Can a pastor in cyberspace speak a Word not subject to eternal transforma-
tion, transubstantiation? Can a word which is structured, dispersed, pack-
eted, be a Word eternal and untransformed? Can one preach to a flock as
hir words are taken from hir, from Hir? Who speaks here and for Whom, to
whom?  Who determines capitalizations, loci, cites and citations, excesses
of Latin alphabet? Who speaks for the Other, oneself, oneself in Other,
Other in oneself? And for others? 'And if not me, who then?'
