Noh ii


the perfect moments when two scene shifters pass and one of them subtlely
  changes, ontologically moving among realms, 
there will be water scenes and descriptions of way-stations and there 
  will be a monk who will tell the story, 
and the man or the woman will not announce themselves at first and then
  they will announce themselves, 
and then there will be the propitiation and the world will be properly  
  set and the lovers reunited or forgivenesses all around, 
then there will be a dance which will be slow and filled with absence
  carrying humans and spirits along, 
and then an ending with positions and the stamping of the foot, this will
  be the conclusion resounding beneath the boards, 
this is our lives, this is our destiny, these meetings and there is none
  beside thee, brought from realm to realm
i await with tears and desperation, the sound of your name and the water
  shimmers ever so slightly, fireflies, nets, fireflies
the distant flute and no one is coming in the dance of spirits, slow dance
and then there will be a world and then there will be a world
hush, and hush, and hush, and hush
a thin light, the insect fluttering high above, exhausted, 
  almost falling,
  dim winking of warm and loving light
