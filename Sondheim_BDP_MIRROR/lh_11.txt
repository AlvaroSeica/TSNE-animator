Parable


Why dogs don't have horns. In bygone days, male dogs had horns centered in
their high and bony foreheads. The horns were symbols of their prowess,
and many a villager was kept awake at night by ferocious fighting - the
horns clattering against each other. One day Nikuko was wending her way
from the hotsprings in Oita - an enlightened being, she allowed her mind
to drift. Suddenly, a ferret crossed the road in front of her. In a split
second, Nikuko and the ferret changed places, Nikuko now running low upon
the ground, working the roads as cross-walks, heading in and out of the
deep forests surrounding her. Sure enough, a dog approached, its horn hard
against the sky. Nikuko was sweating and naked, her skin scratched by
brambles, her breath hot and heavy from running. The dog lowered its head,
Nikuko exchanged places with the horn. The horn fell useless to the ground
and disappeared forever; Nikuko, astride the dog, changed places with a
bee, a bird, a plant, a butterfly, and a ferret, in just that very order.
Now cooled by the shadows of dusk among the bamboo, she continued on her
way. A monk passed by, laughing, and asked, Nikuko, after all this play,
are you any the wiser? Nikuko replied, not in the slightest, Izanagi, not
the least little bit.
