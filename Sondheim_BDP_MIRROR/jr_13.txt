This text took hours to create; beginning with a standard html page, it
was sorted alphabetically, the carets < and > reordered, placed in an html
editor, re-edited, resorted, and so forth. So that a text appears in spite
of itself, broken, a chaotic percolation combining the debris of code and
content, substructure and structure.

Like menses, fragments burn off, half alive, within and without content-
layers which extend above and below code. The text itself is flooding, a
"mess" of partially-differentiated contents, part-objects.

The text decries the etiquette of html; it's obtuse, refusing equivalence
and the potential for corporate reformatting, Reformation. In Netscape or
MSE, it opens as a clotted, readable page, a page stained by text; it
doesn't "go down easily," and the form/at is hardly one of design or con-
crete poetry, so much as one of designation and concrete.

In writing and rewriting, I found parts of the text insistent on hiding
from me; more foregrounded, offering pleasure, as the code was roughed up
for uneasy presentation. It sticks in the throat.

As html rises to the surface, the body of text / textual body, turns as
gyre more in evidence upon the artifice of substructure. The more that is
revealed, the more dis/comfort, dis/ease, as performative and protocol
interpenetrate.

The _economy_ of all of this, the drive towards profit as opposed to the
hacker drive, is evident.
