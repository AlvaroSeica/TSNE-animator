I work with virtual wounded and/or deceased avatars, examining their 
problematic relationship to illness, melancholy, mourning, wounding, and 
death in the physical world; the result is a series of performances in 
Second Life and OpenSim (virtual worlds), texts (both literary and 
theoretical), and real/virtual installations. In order to do this, I 
create modified avatar animations which are projected into physical space 
for live performance; these are made from altered motion capture equipment 
in order to create 'inconceivable' and alien avatars, movements, and 
environments.

I emphasize the political and cultural/physiological dimensions of
wounding/slaughter within and without the cleansed landscapes of social
media and virtual worlds. Conceptually, I'm concerned with returning the
virtual to the real, indicating that more is at stake in the former than
'just manipulation' of avatars. I'm involved in a critique of techno-
philia through these concerns - in particular, the phenomenology of
abjection in relation to both analog and digital realms.
