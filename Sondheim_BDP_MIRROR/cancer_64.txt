leaf


uneasy wind tonight,
quarrel with my bookseller, that's it
quarrel with my father, again that's close to it
quarrel on the lists with everyone
offline quarrel with myself

give me a job and i'll agree with you
give me a little bit of money and i'll be the nicest person around
give me healthcare, dental, eyes and ears, i'll be your greatest friend
give me suicide, let me relax a bit
offline think how nice and softly everything would end

azure gives me time and space to breathe in
i feel like a weight with her, don't want to bring her down
i want to lightly soar, she'll come along just fine
i want to soar with her, no quarrel, big money, air

sonnets go nowhere, i'm always surprised
how they continue on, how one writes and writes
as if every line were a premise or a promise
a premise to build a promise from the past
a promise to build a premise in the future

light is always fading, i'd like to run away from electricity
i'd like to make this into a great poem, but it's not

it's barely readable, it's something i'd ignore while dying
if death is my companion, this poem's already gone

poems and lives are far too long already
the whales are dying, the whales are dying
the deer are killing the whales, shrew are killing the deer
look at that red maple! look at it!
