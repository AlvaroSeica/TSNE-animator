The Fall


Lines beginning > from Wittgenstein, Tractatus-Logico-Philosophicus, Pears
and McGuinness translation. (The TLP as _case._)

>1 Die Welt is alles, was der Fall ist.
>1 The world is all that is the case.

The case is the given, what has falling towards reception.

>1.12 Denn, die Gesamtheit der Tatsachen bestimmt, was der Fall ist und
>auch, was alles nicht der Fall ist.

>1.12 For the totality of facts determines what is the case, and also
>whatever is not the case.

We know that the case is the result of filtering, whether passive or 
active, whether perceived or imperceptible.

>2 Was der Fall ist, die Tatsache, ist das Bestehen von Sachverhalten.

>2 What is the case - a fact - is the exitence of states of affairs.

A case is an interconnectivity, involving facts, pictures, affairs: 
involving the structural matrix of the real.

>2.024 Die Substanz is das, was unabbhangig von dem, was der Fall ist, 
>besteht.

>2.024 Substance is what subsists independently of what is the case.

The case, again, is structured, structuring substance. The structure is 
connected to the Umwelt; it is not case-local. If the world is all that 
is the case, there are cases within the world as well.

>3.342 An unseren Notationen ist zwar etwas willkurlich, aber d a s ist
>nicht willkurlich: Dass, w e n n wir etwas willkurlich bestimmt haben, 
>dann etwas anderes der Fall sein muss. (Dies hangt von dem W e s e n 
>der Notation ab.)

>3.342 Although there is something arbitrary in our notations, _this_ 
>much is not arbitrary - that _when_ we have determined one thing 
>arbitrarily, something else is necessary the case. (This derives from
>the _essence_ of notation.)

The case is a logical or structural production. A waterFall is the result 
of gravity, topography, and chaotic trajectories. The psychoanalytical 
case is that of the Fallen self structured by the metapsychological topo- 
graphy and internal/external chaos.

In 5.1362:

>("A weiss, dass _p_ der Fall ist" ist sinnlos, wenn _p_ eine Tautologie 
>ist.)

>('_A_ knows that _p_ is the case', has no sense if _p_ is a tautology.)

The Fallen takes everything with it; it is surrounded, fibrillated. The 
case is _neither_ abstract _nor_ substance; it is always problematized by 
its reach; only the purely mathematical case is well-defined.

In 5.5151:

>Aber auch hier ist ja der negative Satz indirekt durch den positiven
>gebildet.

>But really even in this case the negative proposition is constructed by 
>an indirect use of the positive.

Here the case is a _situation_ in mathematical logic. The case is the 
structure; the structure is the case. 

In 5.541 is found the clause:

>wie "A glaubt, dass _p_ der Fall ist"

>such as 'A believes that _p_ is the case'

This is in relation to "gewissen Satzformen der Psychologie," "certain 
forms of proposition in psychology." This need not be taxonomic, i.e. X 
is schizophrenic, but a state of affairs: X is troubled by the death of 
her daughter.

Referring to elementary propositions, Wittgenstein asks in 5.5542:

>Hat die Frage einen Sinn: Was muss s e i n, damit etwas der-Fall-sein 
>kann?

>Does it make sense to ask what there must _be_ in order that something
>can be the case?

Thus something may _not_ be the case, for example, if it were substance 
(within the ontological), or if it were false, for example, the largest 
prime (within the epistemological). 

Of course possible worlds arguments utilizes cases which are not the case;
this is the domain of modal logics. 

Now look at the outside, ausserhalb, of the World, in which the case is 
seen as accidental in relation to structure - therefore structure itself 
participates in the accidental; we are thrown accidently. But the _case_ 
remains one of contingency, contiguity, ontological/epistemological 
transgression, outside the domain of mathematics. (And there are indica- 
tions that this domain, as well, is not self-contained.)

>6.41 Der Sinn der Welt muss ausserhalb ihrer liegen. In der Welt ist 
>alles, wie es ist, und geschieht alles, wie es geschieht; es gibt 
>_in_ ihr keinen Wert -- und wenn es ihn gabe, so hatte er keinen Wert.
>   Wenn es einen Wert gibt, der Wert hat, so muss er ausserhalb alles
>Geschehtens und So-Seins liegen. Denn alles Geschehen und So-Sein ist
>zufallig.
>   Was es nichtzufallig macht, kann nicht _in_ der Welt liegen, denn
>sonst ware dies wieder zufallig.
>   Es muss ausserhalb der Welt liegen.

>6.41 The sense of the world must lie outside the world. In the world, 
>everything is as it is, and everything happens as it does happen: 
>_in_ it no value exists--and if it did exist, it would have no value.
>   If there is any value that does have value, it must lie outside 
>the whole sphere of what happens and is the case. For all that happens
>and is the case is accidental.
>   What makes it non-accidental cannot lie _within_ the world, since 
>if it did it would itself be accidental.
>   It must lie outside the world.

The world is all that is the case. Please open the case again. Nothing 
was in the case. Her case is interesting. His case was closed.

The simplest account of postmodernity: ausserhalb under erasure.
