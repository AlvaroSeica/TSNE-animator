Swamp


We are found with language. Being with one another, who finds us? 
And what we are found with, we have never asked for. 
Nor is it a given that this would always be the case, nor that angels
or others have brought language to us, what may be considered "it."
What is the finding in this regard, and what is a finding?
Is a finding the totality of results, or is it an opening or proffering?

The plane crashes in the swamp and there is an outcry for "loved ones."
They are always "loved ones" after death, and now they threaten
the Everglades themselves, but anything to recover a bit of flesh
or bone is the finding that will give someone something to speak _of._

A dying boy here gets his last wish from a foundation to kill 
a Kodiak bear in Alaska. The bear is treed first by dogs because this
is a sport whose findings are entrails. I would rather the boy's death
than this deliberate massacre. I would rather the bodies swamp food
than further desecration.

We are _mired_ with language. The earth collapses beneath the weight of 
pronouns.

"Paradoxically, it is the strength of the ego's identification with the
object world and with tradition (the superego) that in the long run en-
sures its demise. As Porte moves deeper into the swamp, the resistance
between image and association seems to subside." (David C. Mill, Dark
Eden, The swap in nineteenth-century American culture.) The _sputtering_
of language _splatters,_ _splitting_ the imago _spitting_ and _spattered._
What's _spotted_ is chaotic; there are no words for _it._

Here, we're _found with unfounded language._ Surface fissures, no other 
comment is necessary. There's far too much reliance on silence, speech is 
synonymous with desecration. Let the bear maul the boy.
