perhaps the poorer for it would be a title


sometimes there is writing that can only be done in confinement,
solitary, as if cauterized from the rest of the human race, racism.
it's then, languorous, lain back in perfect submersion on the divan
that jennifer will come to me, or hypnagogic imaginaries
of julu buried beneath the ground, nikuko in nakasukawabata.
look! and they will disappear, returning confinement to the prison-house,
don't look! and they will speak in every which-a-way in seizures
trampling my body beneath the hooves of sacrificed horses,
other immolations moving through water into the density of fire,
entombed like julu or dispersed in air-borne jennifer,
these plagues of emanations pressing on the ribs and throat and face.
oh, this is so like prose or simple poetry, writes jennifer here, peering
over my shoulder, both left and right, across the skull's top, beneath
the decreased pressure of my feet upon the ground, hands across the keys,
the gesture of uneasy fingers trying on her language once again - oh this,
_this_ is so like poetry, but don't i force you, i am writing this, 
to live alone, outside communality that would sweep away myself
and each and every other darkness together we've uncovered? the solitary
traveler starves and begs, but there are coves and dim-lit meadows we have
seen, populated with dark and ill-drawn birds, the stuff that fantasies
are made from, descended from some dark and brilliant future. a book 
of living words, these phrases engorged, descended from crags and split-
stone valleys, now where was i, where i was. so i, as if slain, supine
upon divan, pillowed head angled, perfect for jennifer or julu, nikuko's
effusions, those aired perfumes alighting and aligned, all drinking at my
breasts' full milk, what lovely food they write.
