(laws and protocols)


that when the letters fall apart, and there are viruses that will send
them to the bottom of the screen, nothing is legible, arms and legs
disappear, mouths coalesce only to dissolve in streams of inchoate sounds

that there are laws in real life against just these potentials, azure will
not do this to alan, alan will not do this to azure

azure and alan > to > jennifer

not an addition but think of subsummation architectures in which literally
you will get the _idea_ which is that of the motivated _thing_

to jennifer, then, but not to azure and alan: the laws

to jennifer, then, the protocols
