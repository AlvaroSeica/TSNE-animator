Death


To pass this on, to pass on, from someone on PMC2, to kill oneself, anni-
hilate one's character permanently, type: eval @recycler:_recycle(player)
and this is what occurs: one's character is recycled, one's objects are
suddenly transformed to the recycler, and the MOO signs you out immedi-
ately. Thus I have eliminated Alan / Clara / #14773 on PMC2, killed off
any remnants of Quota Review Board participation, and hopefully have
avoided further recriminations, neuroses, paranoias, psychoses, failure of
heart and nerve, untoward aggressions, and proliferations of whining, all
accompanied by subtle software changes in an already overwhelmed database. 

Which is not to say I will not return as another, the farthest possible
from myself, residue perhaps of a future anterior, or where I would like
to _occur_ in any future exchange, ornamental or not. As for the rest of
you, I would suggest eval @recycler:_recycle(player) without a moment's
hesitation before the darkness descends once again on lands textual, with-
out recourse to absolution, bishops or their mitres, or the Hurrian god 
of weather for that matter, Teshub, and his consort, Hebab.

The weather is hurricane, tornado, blizzard, tsunami, monsoon, earthquake,
flood, and the weather is pestilence. MOOs seduce the contaminated. To 
annihilate oneself, perhaps to return, perhaps not, is a boon. Seduce me.
eval.
