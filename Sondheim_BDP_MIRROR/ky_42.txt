There appears to be some writing on the note ...

you do wound me cut shivered into shoulder
Bodee you do open shoulder entrance into breast
Bodee you do burrow into nipple tissue
Bodee Bodei where are you
I am so happy here within tissue erect on Bodei-Man
Bodei-Man where are you

do close so very now warm from april dryness
you do borrow burrow-skin what a pretty person
Bodei-Bodee-Man where are you Bodei-Woman
you will be that woman and you will be that man
you do wind me in your cloth oh Bodei-Woman cotton
Bodee! Bodee!
