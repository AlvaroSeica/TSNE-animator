Dinosaurs on television make a lot of noise.

They fight restlessly before the screen,

Attacking girls and boys. They have little joys

Except for the pure pleasure of bleating

Which signals they're about to begin eating.

The people stand in front of them, or a leg

Will appear, defying imagination, just a prop

Which makes the viewer beg them to stop

Heming and hawing, but find an animal to rage

Or better yet, place star and starlet in a cage

To see what happens. The beast is off again to Bermuda,

As for the star and starlet, I could've clued ya.



- Ogden Nash
