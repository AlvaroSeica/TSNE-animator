there's a platform below for discussion and choreography demonstration.
but if you sit on the platform, you generate particle spew energy.
only one person can sit on the platform at a time.
there's no room for two people to sit on the platform together.
above the platform there are several running spews.
these spews continue no matter what else is happening.
but they're out of sight when you're on the platform.
when you're paying attention to the platform.
when you're paying attention to the activities on the platform.
you can sit just about anywhere on spheres or other objects.
almost all of them spew and interfere with vision, movement, sound.
for you can only move from sitting to standing.
and when you are sitting you are dancing and prancing.
your avatar is no longer yours.
your avatar is guided into frenzy by an object.
frenzy and spews might interfere with serious demonstration below.
"zany levels zing."
