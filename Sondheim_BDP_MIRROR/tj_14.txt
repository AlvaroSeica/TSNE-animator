talk outline http://www.alansondheim.org/keyword.pdf

stumbled a great deal here, compensated, apologies
for any inaccuracies. lots of work shown, really happy
with the q&a and thanks to everyone who participated,
spoke, organized!

covered about 1/10 of what i'd like to have, and 
found myself running around far too much in my head; 
on the other hand, the images and videos spoke for
themselves. near the end, azure singing, myself on 
violin with revrev thanks to luke damrosch, version
1.6+.

"That which makes itself known to the individual
consciousness as sexual impulse in general, and 
without direction to a definite individual of 
the other sex, is in itself, and apart from the
phenomenon, simply the will-to-live."
