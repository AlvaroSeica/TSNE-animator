=, towards the next
millennium, I have loved you for one thousand years (indexed from M. Gira,
Jarboe, Skin), I shall not live to see the aural sparks, hear the bows of

	place the senses in their box
	then throw away the keys, their locks
	place the census on the blocks
	where second-hands of slicing-clocks

	and with it eye, and distant ear -
	and with them tongue, and nose and cock
	and cunt and clit will break the stock
	and free our shackes and the true,
	alallarum alallaru
