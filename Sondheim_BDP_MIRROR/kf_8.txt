No Idea Who He Was


On this unending train, I do not leave either trace or trail, progres-
sing across the Australian landscape. This is the silent visitation of
the strange, something needing theorization, as it is characteristic
of modern life. Forget Kristeva's romanticism, Simmel here - I'm talk-
ing about the deep, almost random, loss of memory built into the land,
into the recordings of journeys taken every minute. I'm talking about
complete and utter _disappearance._

For example, that bicyclist I have seen in the distance, recognition
of the pure and complete body that drives the framework - but at _such_
a distance, the face unrecognizable, nothing more to be seen or said.

These moments of _mind and organism_ constantly passed, unsurpassed.

Whose legs are those just so visible behind the automobile parked by
the curb in front of the milk bar at the end of the road?* Just as the
face _might_ appear, there is always some obstacle - the speed of the
train, an inappropriate intervention on the part of a large truck,
effacing the face in a fashion one might take as absolute.

Whose legs are those do not recognize a question mark.
