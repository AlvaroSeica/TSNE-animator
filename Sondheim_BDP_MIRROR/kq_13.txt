What a mess this junk when you won't speak to me, won't leak to me, when
everyone in town seems down, when I seem like a clown, when you've got
blood on your gown, you won't streak to me, you won't come to me - you
won't cheat on me - you won't cheat on him - what a mess when you close
down when I'm your clown when you wear a frown - what a mess when you
won't meet me, when you won't treat me, you won't beat him - when he's on
the town, when I wear your gown - I know you treat him, you seem weak to
me, why don't you seek me when you're not around - I'm not your clown - he
wears a frown - why don't you speak to me - I know I'm down - there's
blood in the MUD - you should cheat on him, you should beat on him - you
should meet me, you should treat me - I know you're down, you're not
connected, I'm vivisected -
