unclearness of wounding


through my mother's death (which she no longer possesses),
 i have determined (as has been determined for me): 
 that there is only one death; that this death has no number;
 that it is lived once; that it is harbored as a secret illness;
 that it is coveted in secret; that it comes but once, remains;
that there is only one passage, one text, one whisper;
that nothing is of import; that cathection is cathected;
 investment invested; meaning meant and maintained;
that death is no example; that memory declares, withdraws;
 that death is always for the living; that living death is
 constancy; that annihilation is the value of a world; 
that negation is a token; that ipseity struggles with the angel;
 that writing is of the suppurated body; that skin is wound;
 that wound or illness have no death (i.e. have nothing to do
 with death, or continue past the death of the individual - or
 that wounding and illness are continuous - the text is unclear)
