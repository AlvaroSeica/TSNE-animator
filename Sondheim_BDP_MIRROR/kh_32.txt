Parable of Self-Reproduction


When I think that for two dollars you may drink the piss of Daishin
Nikuko, I, Daishin Nikuko, become in fact wetter than is my normal 
state, to the extent that my bladder increases its capacity, and I am
led to drink, motivating me within the fifteen-sake state. As that is
my current constitution within the 26 [letters, trans.], you will 
perhaps have a double or duplicated dosage. So that your desire does
inflame me, increase my capacity, which surely can only enlarge your
desire. You may think in this fashion that I am but a fashion, a 
transitive term present to do your bidding, but rest assured that the
imaginary of your eager mouth provides more than enough sustenance 
for this dark night - I know that piss will silence you, your half-
closed eyes refusing the visible world. Such is nirvana or satori or
enlightenment and its dark stream. And I, Daishin Nikuko, will hear
no more of your chatter.
