Droste and Berber in rehearsal
never before released footage from the original production
with new tabla accompaniment especially commissioned
by the hairs of Droste and Berber
cut off from the bodies of Droste and Berber
as well as accompanying avatars created from cloth and wire
held in suspension creating a perfect framework
for this first time and perhaps only this time
a framework where Berber first sadly languished
then rose to the occasion of Droste's bizarre accompaniment
this silent film direct from the Weimar era
salvaged from numerous bunkers of works of tired cinema
lay sadly in shadows where reels of film were found
presented now almost in their pristine original condition

the hairs of Droste and Berber were tangled sadly
among the reels where memories of Droste and Berber
languished among the clubs of old Berlin

dance

to do some nude work, the 'tethering' pieces, if you're up to it, no pun 
intended. the camera-woman would also be nude; you and i would be tethered 
together, my hand pulling your member, your hand pulling mine - two 
sections or episodes. you'd dance, furious, try to get away, to come 
close, to twist, to turn, either your hand or your member would refuse the 
motion, hold you pack, collapse culture, return to the swarm. there's a 
mirror; all of us, including the woman appear; it's as if we're competing 
for her; as if she's withdrawn; as if she's seeing everything; as if 
everything's exposed to her; as if she's the last woman on earth; as if 
we're on stage; as if we're staging this; as if we're one and splitting; 
as if we're drawn into each other; as if we're split into one; as if we're 
opening up; as if we're closing down; as if we're body to her techne or 
techne to her body; as if i'm holding you back; as if you want to go 'with 
the others'; as if the others have disappeared; as if you're used to it; 
as if i'm desperate; as if i'm holding your member; as if you're afraid of 
that; as if you're holding my member; as if i'm afraid of that; as if i'm 
holding your member; as if i'm afraid of that; as if you're holding my 
member; as if you're afraid of that; the woman's afraid of nothing; the 
woman's the intransitive; the woman's the fulcrum; the apex; the nadir; 
the woman's the absent locus; our members compete for the woman; our hands 
hold our members back; my hand refuses the presence of your member (for 
the woman); your hand refuses the presence of my member (for the woman); 
you're dancing; i'm awkward holding on; your graceful holding on; you're 
in some other space; i'm in the space of my member; two episodes: we're 
nude, standing - my right hand is holding your semi-erect member tight; 
you're dancing, tethered; the dance conforms to tethering; there's no 
escaping for five minutes - then your right hand is holding my semi-erect 
member tight; your dancing, tethering me; i'm held there; the dance 
conforms to the holding; there's no escaping for five minutes; there's one 
then the other; there's the other then the one; the woman is holding the 
camera; the camera is running; the camera is running and not stopping; the 
camera keeps running the length of the episodes; the camera runs ten 
minutes; the camera runs twelve minutes; the camera runs before the 
beginning and through the episodes; the camera runs after the ending; the 
camera is running

Happy birthday to me
Happy birthday to me
Happy birthday to Alan
Happy birthday to me

from the 406 manatees killed this year
from the starving polar bears
from the hundreds of thousands of Iraqi dead
from the victims of famine and hurricanes
from those slaughtered by death squads
from my dead mother
from those born of tornados and floods
from those, those burned alive
Happy birthday to me



from my partner and friends
Happy birthday to me

It's always in the peripheral that accidents occur, organisms are born. 
You can hunt anywhere, you can hunt online. Ghosts are here, their images 
trapped, evanescent. Always present, always lost, the very thickness of 
our flesh at stake.

ghost ghostrap disappearance transparence

Sometimes I will write a line, a single line, several words and barriers, 
and they will seem sufficient, they will seem to resonate with the real, 
to dance in the mind of the reader or writer, sometimes that appears all 
that is necessary, as if philosophy is a foregone conclusion, need nothing 
more than the memory of a signifier of a catalyst, and this is one of 
those lines, those moments, opening up into places I cannot enter, places 
I have made for you and the fecundity of your detailing; I create my own 
barriers and thresholds, my own emissions and derailings, beyond which
nothing remains but fear, the slight scent perhaps of Anita Berber or 
Dogen, or just the masquerade of a scent, construed from the shadows in 
the corner, Carneades' snake or rope, history softly murmuring fact after 
fact after fact...

1. the expulsion from the real
neither A nor B
V opens from loving arms
you can't go back there
2. the ruptured huddle
not both A and B well I never
scrabbling for food
at least there's a chance of eating

3. entrance of the hungry ghost
not A you won't find anything here
somewhere else I really don't care
reality isn't where you find it
4 backing out of everything
you're stuck with flooded B
thirsted collapsed desert
mountain flood girl boy sutra

modeling, division by zero

when i was very young i lived in a world of division by zero. the result 
was infinity with n <> 0, but this was modified. 20/0 = 10/0 of course but 
we might write I (for infinity) so that I(20) is distinct from I(10). 
generalize: x/0 becomes I(x) and f(x)/0 becomes I(f(x)). what develops is 
a sense of process and history; I(f(x)) is dependent on the operations 
that lead up to it for any specific I(f(x)); it's as if 2 + 2 = 3 + 1, but 
the operations remain different and distinction; 4(2,2) may be considered 
distinction from 4(3,1). and this is true, providing the intercession of 
an operator is implied; 2 might for example be manageable and 3 not. the 
modes become more interesting when other f(x)/0 are involved or when 
thinking through (x/0)*(0/y) - the temptation is to produce x/y or even 
f(x)/f(y), canceling the 0, and within our mathesis, this may be reason- 
able. but again the 0 must be kept visible, historic; we might writer 
"(f(x)/f(y)) qua 0/0" or some such; it's evident that indices, both sub- 
and super-, quickly develop, become unmanageable. history piles on 
history, the mathematics leaves a necessary trace on the result - neces- 
sary because (x/0)*(0/y) is strictly I*0, which is up for grabs. the 
history imposes exactitude, facticity, where none is; it is a mathematics 
of sand-grains, not continua, of course related to infinitesimals, non- 
standard analysis, and so forth. but here, and when i was young, i valued 
these equations which told stories, stories that not only where inherent, 
but integral to their value in both senses of the word.

... i was in revolt, against mathesis, against those equations excluded, 
beyond the Pale, for no apparent reason, against the simultaneous weaken- 
ing and strengthening of zero, of nothing at all ...

( the shy zero, adding nothing to anything; the murder zero, multiplying 
and forgetting; the burgeoning zero, dividing into the production of the 
world; the generous zero, taking nothing away )

Real-time file access and organization -

Here is the problem, as anyone following my work can attest - there's too 
much of it. I'll be at the Openport festival in Chicago the end of the 
month, doing a symposium, talk, two performances. So I'm attempting to 
organize files for the last, and it's difficult. I narrowed the video/ 
audio work to 900 files - and these are edited from the mass of my video/ 
audio work in general, running I think around 2500. I've placed the files 
in two folders, Performance 1 / 2. The names (titles) of the files convey 
nothing. I'm still naming from the film years when one produced "pieces" 
with such. So there are 900 names, and I forget what most of these things 
are. It's not even easy to tell by extension - there are sound files for 
example ending as .mp4, and some of the .mov are set for no framework and 
loop; these are most often converted .mp4 in disguise. The problem with 
.mp4 in performance - the compression uses a lot of CPU cycles; the result 
is that it's actually more difficult to run a number of parallel .mp4 
files (which are quite small) than to run the same from the original very 
large .mov or .avi files.

Thumbnails won't do - they would be too difficult to manage, would clutter 
up the screen, wouldn't handle audio. I think of code - G for Geneva, D 
for dance, GG for Gruyere, GA for Aletsch glacier work - but then the 
individual pieces are still left behind. I've tried brief 2-3 word 
descriptions in the titles, but that doesn't seem to help; there are 
variations, some of the work is indescribable in terms of a few words, and 
so forth. In any case, the directories have to be on the screen when I'm 
performing - that's the whole point of it - the ability to choose video/ 
audio on the fly. I'm not sure where to take this - memorizing indices, 
mnemonics ... The total number of still images that I work with (i.e. not 
family) is about 10000. The total of everything is probably around 14000.

I swim in these. I need a directory structure for everything, coupled with 
a search engine; I need keywords and a way to delimit and present files 
during performance; I need a system which is easily understandable on the 
fly. I'm speaking of approximately 200 gigabytes of material here. I've 
been sitting going through file after file; it's a real impossibility! If 
the equipment holds up (I've been having difficulties with Quicktime 
retaining its preferences which are critical), things should run smoothly 
- they'll be more out of control than ever, the semantics of the perform- 
ance trying to keep up. But the presentation will, internally, be somewhat 
scattershot. I work with laser scan, motion capture, dancers, mappings and 
remappings of the human body, landscape, very low frequency and shortwave 
radio, filtered and unfiltered recordings of various musical instruments, 
images from the problematic of 'wilderness,' video and audio bounced and 
transformed across the country, material from Second Life performance, 
materials from programs like Netstumbler (tracking wireless), modified 
travel footage, local histories and architectures of early mass transit, 
sexuality, the 'edges' of languages, choreographies, interactivities, 
codework and codework software, Mathematica, and video/audio noise across 
the Net, offline as well. All of these areas are subsetted; they spread 
like tentacles across my workspace, (in)(co)herent, lost and found; now 
when I perform, I'm part audience, seeing the (re)presentation for the 
first time, trying more desperately than ever to hold everything together. 
This is a world of the forgotten, unorganized in relation to 'the clean 
and proper body,' inert to deconstruction (which is collapsed by error, 
circles of confusion, exhaustion, loss), open to Levinas' existence and 
existents. Never do I know where this has gone, will go. But I still need 
something of a system, something of a path through the dark woods. (And of 
course any suggestions greatly appreciated.)

Reel Histrionic


In Eloquent Gestures, The Transformation of Performance Style in the 
Griffith Biograph films, Roberta E. Pearson describes 'histrionic' and 
'verisimilar' codes of acting - a transformation from a melodramatic locus 
to incipient realism. She considers them in relation to 'analogical' and 
'digital' communication: "Though most gestural communication systems are 
unsegmented and analogic, the histrionic code, with its emphasis on the 
isolation of gesture, does resemble segmented, digital communications such 
as speech. Actors deliberately struck attitudes, holding each gesture and 
abstracting it from the flow of motion until the audience had 'read it.'" 
[...] "Not only were aspiring actors told to 'rest long enough in a 
gesture,' they were urged to avoid excessive movement, which might detract 
from attitude-striking." [...] "The elimination of the small gestures 
brings about the physical equivalent of silence between the grand, posed 
gestures, resulting in the 'discrete, discontinuous elements and gaps' of 
digital communication." In contrast, the analogical references the uncoded 
real, motions and emotions of daily life.

The digital is catastrophic, fold-catastrophic; it consists of jumps 
between gestures or stances, between emotions and their concretion as 
attitude. The histrionic is dependent upon the diegetic - it as acted 
action of the unfolding interpreted world. The histrionic is therefore 
always stylized and responsive, within and up to thresholding. A threshold 
is constituted by an increased differentiation between gesture and the 
diegetic real; this itself is stylized. In other words, there are two 
levels of code, stylization at work: the semantic contents of individuated 
gestures, and the syntactic divisions between them. The gestures are 
individuated (not individual); as with other linguistic formation, they 
are constituted by difference, differance, the playing among gestures 
'down the line of the unfolding of the diegetic.' So histrionic gestures 
bridge from one moment to another in the form <------<----<----- - they 
are held positions until anomaly (threshold) defers them.

Gestures are concretions operating within time's arrow, objectifying the 
body in a sequence of irreversible positions. The body constitutes the 
proffering of desire - it is held for the viewer, much as the display of 
the (sexualized) body operated in some elements of Weimar dance/cabaret 
culture. This holding is reminiscent of the still pornographic image, 
which is presented to the (mostly male) viewer; the viewer is aware that 
the histrionic is there for his or her pleasure. In the pornographic 
photograph, the erogenous zones function as 'strange attractors'; the 
diegetic is constructed by the viewer who creates a narratology resulting 
in masturbation, the cessation of (that) pleasure. The zones, however, are 
grounded in the analogical, the abject; the viewer is without the gesture 
of the histrionic (in both silent film and pornography).

Stylized gestures reference a repertoire, of course; they must be under- 
stood by both the actor (in re/presentation) and viewer (as indexical 
within the diegetic). And repertoires are always stylized, enumerations of 
entities that play, one way or another, within specified cultural milieus. 
In this sense, all repertoires are accumulations of conventions and genre; 
in the case of the histrionic, they are a rough set of mappings into (and 
constituting) the diegesis, in order that the photoplay 'move forward' for 
both actor and spectator. (This moving is literally self-centered within 
the pornographic, which plays within the (transitive and transitional) 
body of the viewer in both (interrelated) psychoanalytical and biophysical 
registers.)

(But pornography as well as photoplay is never fully reductive; defuge 
creates another deferral, from image to image, film to film. This is what 
might be considered the 'repressed of the analogical,' the referencing of 
the clean and proper body and life-story in relation to the messiness and 
decathection of everyday life. The analogical is always excessive and 
irreducible; digital mappings are mappings from one-to-many, mappings into 
the analogical (body and) real. Digital mappings are not only stylized; 
they are undergoing continuous transformations, splittings, decathecting, 
disinvestment, as the surplus of the analog has moved elsewhere. What 
constitutes pornography or photoplay, fashion or convention, at one 
synchronic instant, is constituted elsewhere at the next. The repression 
constructed by the diegesis itself (which leaves out so many things in the 
world) returns in so many different forms which become increasingly 
mutually unreadable.)

"The name _sensuality_ seems to be taken from the sensual movement, of 
which Augustine speaks, just as the name of a power is taken from its act, 
for instance, sight from seeing. Now the sensual movement is an appetite 
following sensible apprehension. For the act of the apprehensive power is 
not so properly called a movement as the act of appetite; since the 
operation of the apprehensive power is completed in the very fact that the 
thing apprehended is in the one that apprehends, while the operation of 
the appetitive power is completed in the fact that he who desires is borne 
towards the desirable thing. Hence it is that the operation of the appre- 
hensive power is likened to rest; whereas the operation of the appetitive 
power is rather likened to movement. Therefore by sensual movement we 
understand the operation of the appetitive power. Thus, sensuality is the 
name of the sensitive appetitive." (From Aquinas, Summa Theologica, trans- 
lated by Anton C. Pegis, Introduction to St. Thomas Aquinas, Modern 
Library, 1948.)
