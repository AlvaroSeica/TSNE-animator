Dear Bob -



-- but the messages are debris, placenta generated from unproductive

miscarriages - but they're viral or rotifera, identical molecular or

cellular structures --

-- but they're inchoate, menses - but they never received an answer -

clones forever of unrequited love, exponential increase of romantic

tissue, legions of faltering hearts, collapsed lungs, legions of tears

marching step-by-step to a 1930s graveyard steel chorus --

-- the chorus of inflationary universes, but they're victims of the lie

of the eternal return - they don't wait for the return, they generate

their own returns, absorb the universal filaments of dark plasmatic

matter --



-- but they're really lost in the wires, disappeared into the chaotic

domain, below the level of quantum noise, a few stuck in hard-drives

rotating until the machine collapses of its own accord --

-- for a second, earth shone brighter than the brightest star, on the

toby borgeest wavelength --



-- for a second, now that he's forgotten, the unhappy reader of this

text scratches her head --

-- WHO IS TB, she asks, what DREAD DISEASE spews forth, replicates 

itself in the habitus of cybermind? DISEASE gives SHAPE to cybermind,

TB replies; I'm SHAPE-RIDER, fuck with the clouds, make faces in them,

cut writing into dirt, hands into the walls of LASCAUX. --

-- she blows him apart, she does - doesn't even know what he's talking

about. she came late to the list, after the trauma of Saturday last,

didn't see the message-spew, what's called a meltdown on the Net, all

500 messages, 8 megabytes of it --



-- they unsubbed in droves, stormed the server, ran hysterically one 

direction or another. o I tried to help them, couldn't get through,

their accounts overflowed with TB, TB with NET stalkings, closed every-

one out --

-- but they came back, yes they did, bringing the new ones, the young

ones, the unafraid ones, naive ones - and TB's waiting in the wings for

the next BIG STRIKE, take out a whole backbone he thinks to himself,

stuff their mouths --



-- but no really, nothing's happening, they're gone, just like speech

goes, just like the SERMON IN THE MOUNT. filled with dirt, gone bone,

chilled, gone flesh, gone nothing, dust, not that --

-- not nothing, gone, dead away --
