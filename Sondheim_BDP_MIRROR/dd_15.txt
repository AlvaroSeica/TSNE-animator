Definition of _Authority:_

In Central Jury, one listens for one's name; one is called to a case in an
area designated as Empanelling Rooms 1-7. 

One's name is called through a loudspeaker system that reaches through
Central Jury into both a Jury Lounge and the toilets. 

The call is that of Authority; it resonates in the space, spreads; one
comes face to face with the State and there is no face. 

All power is virtual and the virtual is deadly.

Is cleaning the _inverse_ or _obverse_ of power?
