I'm wearing your panties at the moment. 
I have a big letter A carved into my chest.
I've got the Slits playing again and again on the record-player.
There's an all-night bar playing darts and tunes.

I've got the hots at the moment.
Whirl around with darts against the walls and panties, chests.
I've got the record-player strapped to my back.
There's a crowd where the panties should be and be and be.

This moment cotton of beautiful cotton tatters lasts.
The bar clock strikes the Slits with a letter A.
Records whirl like darts in your panties and your hots.
The letter A strikes back with walls and chests.

Furniture skips a note and disappears
When I'm wearing your panties in A carved on my chest.
