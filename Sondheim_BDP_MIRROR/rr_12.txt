old master

http://www.alansondheim.org/oneminute.mp4

sometimes the old master just put hir hand in and then
took hir hand out

sometimes hir hand was covered with it and sometimes
bald when she took hir hand out

the old master thought she had still got it sometimes
when hir hand was covered with it

and she still had got it when she took hir hand out and
hir hand was still covered with it

sometimes she put hir hand in and it was covered and
she would take hir hand out and it was bald

sometimes she put hir hand in and it was bald and she
took hir hand out and it was covered with it

the old master thought she had still got it when hir
hand was bald and she put hir hand in

hir bald hand was covered with it her covered hand was bald



god speaks through the sarangi

of infinite colors, double-stopping in an
odd way where we hear god, we need this
now, our lives suddenly of stress, we wait
for god and hir answers to our deepest 
needs and thoughts, playing, praying, and
tuning as we have said for so many years,
now fecund, now come, now come fruition,
our scope to thee, our poesis and moment
when s/he comes forth, o murmur,
o murmur,

Math and Disturbance

http://www.alansondheim.org/mathcell1.mp4
http://www.alansondheim.org/mathcell2.mp4

Disturbance in the visual field with glass effect 
parameters changed in the Aftereffects menu. The
change alters visual geometries and their appeti- 
tion: what constitutes structure is transformed 
by cellular-biological appearances. in the final,
everything moves and motivates everything else,
and the world is one of dependent origination. I
think this is a dream, but a pleasant one; none 
of these exist outside what the imagination pro-
duces by changing a few parameters.

(Yes, it's the usual effect with tawdry trans-
formation; however, it moves from the cartoon to
the pond's bottom and below.)



Disturbances Continued:

Reset these - they work now:

Please look at all three; they form a dialog
of interest and maybe beauty.

are, i tend to extend myself, risk failure,

panic attacks and my gift to you

http://www.alansondheim.org/mor.mp4

i want to give away my "i", my first-person pronoun,
nary that of an other, nor a third, but mine with
my troubled history, my abilities such as they are, 
my acquaintances, my families, nothing but the "i",
nothing else will occur, these potentials will take
effect after i have died, the potentials will assume
the gift and presence of the self i was, perhaps
would have been, if i had been better, they would
exist in the world as if i were still among them,
among you and those to follow you in the world, the
"i" of these potentials is their eye, participates
in the richness and fecundity of the world, and so
i will love among you and be with you among you, 
and i will not have died or have lived in vain, you
will have assumed the "i"

among my worlds, these are the generated and these are
the generations, across the street, and within the 
aegis of the platform; all inhabit the imaginary, some
are seen through a glass darkly, some through uncanny
thinking among debris littering pavements and drives,
architectures and performative command regimes; i call
a regime the habitus of coding, and architectures, the
weight of the true-real in the outer world; among both
the politics of the franchise and the contestation of
space; among both, the production of the body inscribed;
among both, the abject thwarted; but among both, death
presencing itself on the lip of the boundary

recorded with the Zoom H2; I'm not certain of the players
(except for myself and I'm not that certain even then).
recorded Dec. 8-11 during the 96-hour improvisation; most
of these recordings are from the afternoon. enjoy.

This is the result of an event held at Eyebeam - 
http://www.newlanguages.org/ - an incredible 96-hour 
event. I ran the recorder from an audience seat; the 
files might give you some idea of what went on. In the 
evenings there were more players but the afternoons (when 
I played with others and alone for that matter) had its 
own intensities. I want to thank everyone who made this 
fantastic event possible - check out the blog, the 
Eyebeam site, and Facebook. Thanks, Alan

If anyone objects to any of the files here, of course I'll 
remove them. Thanks again -





Mathesis and Generation

http://www.alansondheim.org/geomatrix.mp4

Sandy Baldwin and I are performing for the upcoming Odyssey
Performance Festival on December 21 at 3 SLT, 6 New York Time.
I've been thinking yet again over what I consider my wounded
psyche, not in terms of healing, but just getting by on a 
daily basis. Buddhism hasn't helped, but I'm fascinated by 
deity generation/completion in Tibetan Tantra. At the same 
time I read cosmology and believe that mathematical ontology
and its dynamics (in the sense of mathesis) constitute the 
basis for our world, our multiverse: every domain is entangled.
An example of mechanism in this regard is the Tibetan prayer
wheel or cylinder; the age of spiritual machines has been with
us forever. For the performance I took the dissected cube
(3-space measure polytope), dissected it into its 3, 2, 1, and
0 components (also measure polytopes), separated them, copied
them, rotated them at high speed, in summary creating a spiky
and high-speed dangerous ground for movement and negotiation.
I've never had the ability to meditate and this installation
troubles meditation or stasis, but so do virtual particles.
Come to the performance where action might occur.

Notes on Music Factory Dec. 8-11

I participated in the Music Factory event at Eyebeam, a continuous 
improvisation over four days, with over fifty musicians. Most of my 
playing was in the morning and afternoon; the larger ensembles were at 
night. I used a number of instruments, including recorders (tenor, 
garkleinflote, and soprano), chromatic harmonica, classical guitar, 
ukulele, sung lisu, oud, cura cumbus, pipa, violin, viola, sarangi, and 
electric saz. Many of these have a 'natural' fundamental or even drones; 
the pipa for example is tuned A-D-E-a (depending on the chosen pitch). 
Most of the instruments use untempered 'natural' scales as well; in other 
words, they play within one or two basic pitches, but may use a variety of 
intervals built upon them. For this reason, they can work awkwardly with 
western or orchestral instruments (even my violin and viola are tuned with 
drones for example, in an Arabic fashion). On the other hand many of the 
players at the event used saxophones, which can be bent towards natural 
scales, but excel at running intervals and scales, and timbre changes; 
they're also relatively loud compared to, say, an unamplified oud. With 
some instruments like the sarangi, I found myself trying to play louder 
and actually making a mess of things; the result was so bad, I discarded 
it. 

In the afternoons I often played alone but had some wonderful duets with 
Chris Funkhouser, Ras Moshe, and others; Azure was sick, and wasn't able 
to sing unfortunately. When I played alone, I played 'in the small' and 
was able to develop whatever I was working on; this also held with duets 
of course, but it was odd, soloing for what seemed to be fairly long 
intervals at times.

In order to explore these directions by the way, I just traded for a 
tambura, in order to work with drones. Drones can be even in intervals of 
a major or minor second, so you have a great number of overtones to play 
with, which is terrific. Another interesting element of tambura - it 
creates communion in a sense, because two people play together, drone and 
otherwise; it removes the isolation that a soloist might feel. And of 
course metaphorically the tambura connects with the cosmos at large - and 
I wonder what quaking aspen sounded like, before primates walked the 
earth.

At night there were large ensembles; what I heard and saw in the broadcast 
was both brilliant and more jazz/new music oriented. There was a lot of 
unison playing, close to drone but changing (also in the afternoons). 
I left feeling I was among brilliant musicians and disappointed somewhat 
in myself, particularly in relation to sarangi - which I love, and which 
is difficult at best. I've been focusing on it since; I also need to 
extend my limited repertoires and scales on viola and violin. I feel that 
in the world of improvisation - and this is so general as to be nonsense - 
there are two regimes - I think Alain Danielou also talks about this - one 
which is the western scales/harmonies/timbres/horn mechanisms/psycho- 
acoustics/mostly but not always tempered scales/training - and the other, 
which often works of melody/scale/natural temperments/drones/bases and 
'returns' (which are different than tonic/fundamental), absence of harmony 
or minimal harmonies (gagaku), and different sonic structures altogether 
(think of the alap in raga). The latter favors the instrumentalist or 
singer, although there are any number of large orchestras across Asia, 
full of color (which is often absent, say, in Indian music) and often in 
unison or fifths. This is so general as to be blatantly false. Where it 
does come into play, is in trying to work or 'fit' these different regimes 
together in improvisation. I do feel it's possible but at least for me, I 
need to work on amplification systems, both for monitors and room. The 
latter seemed great, for example with electric saz; on the other hand, I 
couldn't hear my own saz playing but had to 'feel' it along, if I were 
playing with sax. (I do hope next time, if there is one, I can bring other 
oud and guqin players along; I tried unsuccessfully.)

The music was phenomenal and there were so many amazing styles, solos, 
duets, combinations of instruments, that things were always exciting. I 
can't remember a dull moment; Jackson's idea of a sonic citizenry or 
communality held true. The staff was also amazing and things ran smoothly. 
I though a number of us would be staying overnight; I napped, but that was 
all.

What was most impressive was the opening of a kind of space that took on 
its own characteristics over a period of time, that became a habitus 
opening new artistic territory. I'd love to see this happen again, even on 
an annual basis; if we could use miniaturization for recording and work 
somewhere where the staffing didn't have to be quite so on alert, it might 
work. Certainly the experience of what is at least close to a unique and 
beautiful event is worth building upon.

I'd also like to see an open forum for discussing long improvisation 
somewhere online - there are forums for everything! (I'm on Mike's Oud 
Forum for example), that might develop their own aesthetics and 
phenomenologies, might lead to even other interesting forms of music. This 
event, however, was fantastic by any account!

I want to add that the audio/video broadcasting seemed really integral to 
the whole - when I wasn't playing or at Eyebeam or traveling there and 
back, I was online listening and watching the music. The broadcast ended 
suddenly around 11:30 Tuesday night - I thought something was wrong with 
my computer - and I hope next time there's a final farewell flourish or 
salute!

Again, I want to thank everyone for participating and let's go forward 
from here!

- Alan
