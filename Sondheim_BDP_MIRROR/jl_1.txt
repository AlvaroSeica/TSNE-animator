Jennifer <--> Jennifer

Jennifer was very unhappy and sat down, spreading her new pink frock.
Jennifer took the two white pills her very best friend had sent her, and
Jennifer placed them in her mouth. She thought they tasted odd, and
Jennifer began to see and hear everything in a big wide fuzzy blur.
Jennifer slumped in the center of her nice red frock, and died, said
Jennifer, standing up, and straightening herself out, what fun.
