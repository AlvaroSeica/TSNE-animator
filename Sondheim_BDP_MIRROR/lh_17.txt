Parable


A well-made shakuhachi is created from root bamboo, worked on for weeks
and months, lacquered inside, a hardwood insert in the mouthpiece. When
Nikuko plays the shakuhachi, whole worlds appear within the moist interior
air between the five finger-holes. Bacteria thrive, stationary waves hold
colonies of protozoa in perfect suspension. After the shakuhachi is
swabbed, smaller life-forms cling to the lacquer, and for hours or days,
cultures appear and disappear. One evening, while Nikuko played beneath
her basket, two robbers approached her. Her shakuhachi was made from a
single piece of bamboo without any joints, and, with the old narrow bore
and wide stem, it was a strong instrument. Nikuko, swinging it this way
and that, defeated them without missing a note. There are many silences in
shakuhachi music, and life-within, life-without, each contains histories
full of pathos, sweetness, violence and despair, lives clinging to the
sounds, suspended.
