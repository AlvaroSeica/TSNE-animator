Word (literally, I don't know what I'm talking _about_):


Moments of pristine beauty from Edgar Sturtevant, A Hittie Glossary, 
Works of Known or Conjectured Meaning with Sumerian and Akkadian Words 
Occurring in Hittite Texts, 1936 (diacritical marks not included):

watar, wetar (watar, uwatar, gen. witenas, wetenas, wetnas, dat. witeni,
weteni, inst. wetenit, wedanda, pl.? widar, uwitar, dat. uwitenas),
'water.'

kwis 'quis, qui, aliquis' (interrogative, indefinite, relative).

kuwat(t)a(n) [kwat.an], kuwatin, 'whither, why.'

natta 'not; no.'

nu 'then, and; however, but'; the most common sentence connective; always 
the first word in its clause.

tri- (nom. 3-es = *tries or *tres) 'three.'

apasel, apasela 'is ipse.'

sakkan (acc. saqqan), a kind of vessel. (Hebrew, sak, sack.)

hassa- (acc. hassan, gen. hassas, dat. hassi) 'hearth, stove.'

uttar (uttar, uddar, gen. uddanas) 'word; magic spell, magic formula; 
thing, affair; cause, law-case.'

marmaras 'murmur, lamentation'??

I note in passing ALAN, ALAM [from the Sumerian] = essri, 'form, statue.' 
These words appear in Hittite, as does for example the following from the 
Akkadian:

SUS(S)U (in Hittite texts Su-SI) 'sixty.' (Hebrew, shishim). 

SAMU 'sky.' (Hebrew shemayim). This is interesting; my Hebrew etymological
dictionary also gives shmin, Aramaic and Egyptian, as well as shmn, Ugari-
tic. SAMSU 'sun.' (Hebrew shemesh.) Native Hittite nepis is sky; Istanus, 
sun. 

These moments serve as nodes connecting the rest of the language, working
through/into the interior. From German to Latin, we're at a nexus, nu?
Akkadian borrowings go elsewhere, wander throughout the Middle East, North
Africa? 

Cyberspace is Latin; we await the implementation of double-byte characters
and multi-lingual sites without the necessity of special software. Still,
these roots are absented; everything is fetishized. Don't forget that the
letter "G" is an _invention_ (just as ascii itself); there are two Roman 
candidates for the honor (and I forget their names)...
