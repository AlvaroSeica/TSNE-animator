Sonnet

And does When in Despair with Fortune and Men's Eyes, I all Alone Beweep
my Outcast State, From there to Fly so Blindly in Your Mind, Your Jewel
Gives to Me A Fairer Light, Then Curved, Your Name, I Leave my Fate
behind, Tend towards a Far Far Better Sight, Than I have Ever-Gone Before;
O Nikuko, I Hear the Wind-God's Roar, to you?

From there to Fly so Blindly in Your Mind, Your Jewel Gives to Me A Fairer
Light, Then Curved, Your Name, I Leave my Fate behind, Tend towards a Far
Far Better Sight, Than I have Ever-Gone Before; O Nikuko, I Hear the
Wind-God's Roar: I Follow Through, My Love, My Ghost, Her Eyes, Up towards
the Shrine Enshrined, I signed my Fate: When in Despair with Fortune and
Men's Eyes, I all Alone Beweep my Outcast State, 

Do take My Soul Beyond: Despondent, Hurled, the Goddess, Dark, of Death,
Takes Shattered Bones and Flesh, Enmeshed in Shattered Breath, Hark and
Respond!
