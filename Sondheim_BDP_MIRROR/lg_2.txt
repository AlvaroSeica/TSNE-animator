pure land

buddhism, there are crystals that refract light, not into rainbows, but
all shades of whites, greys, blacks, tourmaline and lengthwise, and dark
paths among them, striations

when my mind empties
when my mind empties

great thinned columns splintering, light shattered, torn everywhere, real
markers, needles, diffractions, a world from dark to light, world of one
colour, one light world

when i return it will be all different
i will see the mountain and it will be an ox
i will see an ox and it will be a mountain

no herding pictures for me

grey animals on grey days, grey herds against grey paths, tall crystals
leaning into mind

sheaves of mind and crystals
