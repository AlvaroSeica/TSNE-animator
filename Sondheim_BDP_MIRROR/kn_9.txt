Oh, this is more beautiful than I could ever imagine. I am ytalking
myself, I, Daishin Nikuko
And then I would come out of the cave to see the jeweled ornaments between
my legs, glistening there between my legs, visible in the light of my sun
And there would be the smell of my body everywhere, like the smell of the
earth, and these would be the jewels to be caressed, the magatima I am
wearing now, curved into me
Curved so they emerged in the form of speech and speaking and the
glistening murmurs of the world
Until our speech is curved itself, dense scent now of love, death, you.
