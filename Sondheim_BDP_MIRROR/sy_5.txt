Best listening with headphones. My Qing qin was used for
all three pieces, accompanied by a modern qin on the 
last (which has remarkable subtle stereo). I personally
like the first and third best. Editing was in Audition.
The images are from a local OpenSim server on my laptop,
with the Imprudence viewer and modified prims from my
MacGrid regions.
