Magic Plank





But it's magic; the plank harbors over 1500 pages of text I have written,

memories that can be recalled long past the dissolution of their indirect

addressing. My fingers cross, caress the plank, which always responds and

always perfectly. Error resides within me, I have sinned; the plank con-

tains the future of all culture, my legacy. 



It requires maintenance. It requires charging and recharging and the sites

it has placed and exhausted on the Net require confirmation and occasional

movement. Oh I have traveled in this fashion from one continent to another.

Oh I have carried my belongings upon the back of ftp. Oh digital, they have

not been transformed in the process, nor decayed, nor home to noise and co-

rruption. Perfect, they have wandered, whenever dwelling has been offered.



Through the milk-glass of its screen, I glimpse into the aquarium in which

the remnants of the mirror stage, _the text of the mirror stage,_ has been

inserted. It expands beyond, above and below; it expands before and after.

Swollen, it consumes me; distended, the magic _takes._ I am heard in and

within, through the magic. It is the magic without fetishization, without

subject and object; it is the magic with protocol alone, the beautiful re-

cognitions. 



It is the recognitions that are perfect, even as this body, _this_ body, 

is not. It is the recognitions that remain shuttled among zero and one, on

and off, this and that, here and there, now and then. What is lacking is

between; my legacy is kept in the midst of the shuttling...
