Some notes sent to an email list that might be of interest here -


Just some general comments - First, I'm not sure what the distinction is
between linguistic and non-linguistic. Second, related, I tend to see
culture all the way down - i.e. one might think through cultures of
reptiles, etc., and even further, plants like dodder or slime molds might
also be susceptible here. By culture I'm referencing passed on learning
that's not encoded or is only partially coded, and learning that leads to
non-determinist responses. Third, I think that language is always already
within and without bodies, that bodies are inscribed, and that inscription
is basic to organism. Heinz von Foerster said roughly the same thing in
terms of negation and Shahn Majid develops this in the sense of Venn
diagrams that are based on inscribing boundaries between x and ~x. If one
might look at fields and patterns, these meld within inscription. There is
no brute knowing, there is certainly 'muscle knowledge,' but that also is
within languaging as ball- and guitar-players know. Perhaps languaging stops
at the bordering of pain, certainly death, but pain is inscribed as if
within and without the body, simultaneously centered and decentered, and
death is transparent to inscription.

One surely thinks through intelligences, knowings, fields, and it's hard to
pin these things down. One thing comes to mind, probably as untrue as any of
the above - that labor is externally inscribed, and play internally so - one
might walk away from play, change the rules, delete, just as any
superstructure's always wobbly? But labor - I mean one might not even know
all the rules, and this ignorance is at a cost (having been let go from
university once or twice, not to mention other jobs, I'm as sure of this as
I am of my own neurosis which blinds me).

I love playing the cobza; it can sound like a miniature orchestra, even 
with an incredibly short neck. It's the shortness that allows the strings 
to fan out at the other end, so that the double and triple courses may be 
plucked as individual strings. 

The rebab is new, two-stringed from Palestine, and difficult. I've yet to 
find an online picture of this particular style.

Further notes in relation to the email list post -

Well, the internal/external thing is full of holes. But labor embodies a
fundamental exteriority - one is called upon to perform, for capital, for
survival, whereas play 'wobbles,' it's superstructural, not fundamental.
Play is an internal agreement to follow consensual rules; if it becomes a
performance for survival, capital, it's work. These are fuzzy and irreso-
lute ideas, but there's something 'about' coercion in relation to work, and
something 'about' the wobble in relation to play that I want to empha- size.
Things are murkier when rite/ritual are brought into the picture,
sufficiently murky that the distinctin might be useless.

Let's say that labor is a dwelling in an inert world and play a temporary
life within a consensual one. Labor is brute, play is chimera which may or
may not be brute. There's play at the heart of labor as one temporarily
wears or resists a world, and labor at the heart of play. But the latter is
consensual (what _is_ a baseball game), and the former, within its world, is
chosen for one.

More nonsense...

Breaking New Ground ii


all circumstances are extenuating.

"if you want to understand what they're about, perhaps these works 
will open up the vast chasm of comprehension on the edge of falling
apart - I can't think of any better pieces in this regard, and, for
that matter, in the sheer beauty of fractured movement"

works based on choreia, return, withdrawal from broken edges (before 
one is cut) (before the sound loses its grasp) (before one is cut
out (of the world) (of your acquaintance) (your grasp) (your body)
(of your body my own)).

how does one write or circumscribe the body of movement within 
horizons defined by mappings of hyperbolic geometry in the circle?
the edge isn't just asymptotic; from the outside, it's a bad pill.
what looks like chance is a battlefield; what looks determined is
incandescent birth. 

"the battlefield is your last chance of being-alive, just as your
birth is your first-chance of dying."

there are so many things these movements and sounds are not: listing

dance as a draining, symptom as style, medication-technique, how to

they start with dim memories of body, with landscapes that accompany 
us, we're hounded.

we're hounded by death, but we're also hounded by disease, troubles,
fevers, forgetfulness, wrath, rage, ecstasy, visions, poverty, money,
obligations, lovers, ennui, hallucinations, speed, crime, frustration,
cataclysm, heat, cold, hunger, thirst, nightmares, mutilations, panic,
neuroses, economies of attention, economies of the body, excretions, 
garbage, wounds, scars, allergic reactions, insect bites, age, bad 
eyesight, bad hearing, shudderings, shiverings, fear, belongings,
jealousy, loathing, disgust, addictions. 

the playing-field of hounding, playing-field of the hounded.
one hounds, is hounded; the hounded hounds, hounding is hounded.

or like this: playing-field of haunting, of the haunted. one haunts,
is haunted; the haunted haunts, haunting is haunted. "these texts,
they are haunted."

malign-benign. if i write this sentence beneath the symbolic of 
medication, bandaging, radiation treatment, dialysis. if i write this 
sentence gagged and splayed.

if i write this sentence to control you, if i write this sentence 
under your control. the order to work: persevere.

to persevere, endure, maenad-dance of self-devouring, maenad-music of
self-control. how can that be, except to ensure that the beat is 
periodic, that repetition hungers.

the maenad feeds, hungers for repetition, desecrates it (the repeat- 
ing). they passed it on so far down the line that gender-sex and sex-
gender change. they passed it down farther. 

Who were they? Who's haunting us?

Second Life Dance/Demonstration Video

(for festival)

http://www.alansondheim.org/noOne.mp4

This showcases a variety of moves and 'contrary' spaces within the current 
environment I've set up in Odyssey, Second Life. I quite like it; there's 
no message but fast body/pace always veering somewhere, never quite arriv- 
ing, but always alien/ated. Enjoy.


small narrative of demonamuh

there's water rushing pulling
water rushing pulling at the demon
human appears in lonely rituals
no one is around the demon sees her
she climbs up she slides about
the demon is very still she climbs down
she climbs about
then she climbs about
the demon is the maenad
the secret is the demon is the maenad
she has gone somewhere
where has she gone she has gone somewhere
then look about so much rushing pulling
there's a demon's head in the water
then the demon brings it to a close
the water pours across the screen
then the water pours across the screen

@X

give a number X, let's say it's reflexive with itself, and phenomenolog- 
ically this constitutes identity.

not the signifier of identity, but identity per se.

let A + B = X, and let C + D = X. then clearly A + B = C + D - equivalence 
is transitive. but now let us define a sign @ such that
A + B -@ C + D. in other words, let's say that the two additions are 
fundamentally different processes, say for the subject carrying them out. 
so that one might write X(@)A+B -= X(@)C+D - in other words, beneath or 
within @, the additions are dissimilar. now we are dealing in a classical 
realm within which history is preserved.

this is what I was working on as a child.

let's go further; we might abbreviate A + B as V and C + D as W. then V 
and W have different histories, i.e. of abbreviation as well as symbol 
content. we don't need X to say that if W = V then @W -= @V or equival- 
ently, W -@ V. unpacking W or V again adds history: in fact, _every_ 
operation recontextualizes its objects. we are also dealing in a quantum 
realm in which history is altered by the processes of perception.

this is all so simple.

it's a problem of notation.

if notation implies notating, notation is always an entanglement, always 
entangles. notation builds up hierarchically, holarchically; every return 
adds another layer. 

one can think of this in terms of _immersive_ and _definable_ hierarchies 
(something I thought about in my 20s, building on my child's work). a 
definable hierarchy is such that if A + B = X = C + D then A + B = C + D 
and if A + B = V and C + D = W then V = W = X and this is reversible of 
course and we're working with traditional mathesis, propositional logic, 
and the like. on the other hand an immersive hierarchy inhabits time (is 
inhabited by time) and (perhaps) organism, intentionality, consciousness; 
it's a different phenomenology altogether.

the difference is in the differance which lies in @. @ is an opening to 
Lacan and Kristeva, for example, not Sokal: it is what _makes a mess of 
things,_ mathematically and otherwise; on the level of the uncanny, 
presence is involved.

this presence abjures notation, inasmuch as notation is employed. notation 
_escapes._ 

in this sense one might even write @X -= @X or equally X -@ X - identity 
is problematized. what of this? that @X -= @X involves a _split_ and 
_nothing can be done with this split._ every mark is always already being 
marked, and being marked is always already being marked otherwise.

(of course hierarchy and holarchy disappear as well.)

and of course there's more: it's always possible to construct formal 
phenomenologies of immersion and @, phenomenologies of continuous organic 
transformations. but the constructing per se is on the other of @ itself, 
and substitutions have to stop somewhere, in order to avoid indefinite 
regress: either way, mess appears. (and responsibility, since moving away 
from definability means the preposterous strategy of taking organism 
_seriously._)
