Two, My Selfishness, Paean


Now two people I've known well, have died, in their 40s/50s, now this
is what I look forward to for the rest of my life. For there is a gate
that everyone opens, passes through; it is the gate of diminishment;
yea, though one live forever, one is increasingly alone. Soon, the
details of the world will disappear; there will be a white or black
light; it will appear eternal; then the gate will close. But it will
open elsewhere; it will open for another; yea, though the other walks
in wonder, I will be her diminution. Yea, she will be increasingly
alone; my name will disappear, my belongings dispersed; yea, there are
gates and gates, gates never-ending; the world is a thickness of
gates. Now I have seen the first of many portals; now I await thee;
yea, though now my work is done, I continue to write as if I were
among thee, as if I were among the living still.
