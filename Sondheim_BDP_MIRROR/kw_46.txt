they took away my ceiling from me
oh so brutal
they took it away before they took away the walls
the ceiling would fall without the walls
they took away the walls from me
oh consternation
everything i did was visible to you
the sun was a big ball of gold
the sun was an orange cracker in the sky
the sky blew through me
oh terrifying miracle
stars and comets from one end to the other
a single ray splits in the middle of the sky
as i was saying, they took my floor away from me
oh delirious hunger
flap flap flap flap flap
oh delirious hunger
flap flap flap flap flap
