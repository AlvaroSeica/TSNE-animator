Jennifer-Memory


Write it, write it all down. Id squeezes, is squeezed. Nothing remains;
debris rises to the surface. Construct a flow; this requires vector fields,
calculi, boundary regions, borderline phenomena. Stutter the legend.

Memory becomes nothing; one might say it is all the time there is. Speaking
is momentary through three and a half billion years, the guise of suicide.
Nothing survives. Nothing is memory. Nothing becomes.

It is well not to recognize this, the teen-age Jennifer wrote, in order to
keep on living. It's programmed into us. Anything else would be false. And I
don't mean to imply the truth of this or any other thing. Implication is
always detumescence.

She paused, pen poised, remembering.
