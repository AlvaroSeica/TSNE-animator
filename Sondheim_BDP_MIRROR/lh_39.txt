Parable


Nikuko was bound to the earth by a red cord. She sang
 I'm bound to the earth,
 The earth is my lover,
 The earth is my lover.
Nikuko was bound to the sky by a blue cord. She sang
 I'm bound to the sky,
 The sky is my lover,
 The sky is my lover.
Nikuko was bound all over, only her mouth moved. She sang
 Sky and earth,
 Earth and sky,
 I'm very safe,
 I'm very safe.
The cords said, look, we're writing worlds. They sang
 Yin and yang we're binding,
 Yang and yin we're binding.
Nikuko was bound all over, only her mouth moved.
