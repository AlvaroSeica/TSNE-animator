Disgust with Bill


Thomas rolled around and with a bone-crunching thud gouged out Clara's 
eyes; in turn, she snapped Tiffany's wrist as if it were paper. Bones 
stuck out jagged through the skin, purple and blood-red welts. Honey 
fired once and Thomas went down, intestines releasing their hold on the 
fabulous meal they had enjoyed a few minutes before at Del Monte's. 
Clara's brutally emptied sockets were the last she knew of life, blood 
spurting as the four of them fell through the plate-glass window; trans- 
parent jagged shards cut through Honey's abdomen, severing her hand in 
the process. They were dead before they landed, lucky for them - the mob 
below continued the process of dismemberment. Drooling hulks feasted on 
limbs torn from their sockets; the mutilated faces were unrecognizable.

Luckily the genitalia were still relatively intact and no one swore; it's 
wasn't until much later, when Travis and Cynthia made love, that the 
censors were called. On the way to jail Travis joked that "obscenity was 
in the eyes of the beholder, and of course they were gouged out."
