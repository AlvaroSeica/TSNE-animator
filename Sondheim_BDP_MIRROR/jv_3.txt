Susan would teach him french, relate these antiquated metaphysics to her
hot pomo guys, randy and eager for both of them. She'd desecrate his
philosophy paper while he taught her partial differential equations; she
dreamed of variables loosened in the middle of lean vectors. She loved the
letters he typed: Surely there was something going on here - he was taking
her advice, arming himself. She talked and talked late into the night; ex-
hausted, they slept until noon. Fury burned within them.

Revolution isn't dead, she'd urge, uncross your legs, I'll show you. She
had him where she wanted him, but she too dreamed, and what was dream in 
the midst of devastation? 

She dreamed: Why Tuesday, why Wednesday? This furious intellectual activ-
ity in the middle of the week; later, out of school, he'd forget about it,
it would die for him. She no longer dreamed of examinations, wet and falt-
ering before a judgement that released her intelligence, left her stained
and fallen. You have to understand this, she'd say, it was as if I didn't 
have a leg to stand on. The core of metaphysics is the examination; being 
lay supine there, murderous rape in ts eyes.

She'd never prepared enough; she almost didn't make it.

She said, every narrative begins and ends with a slip of paper.
