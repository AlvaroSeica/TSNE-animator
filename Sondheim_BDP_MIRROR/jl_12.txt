it fell to the floor. the floor opened up and it kept going. it passed
boards and foundation. it fell to the earth. the earth opened up and it
kept going. it passed magma and metals and magma. it fell to the earth.
it fell to the sand and it kept going. it passed air. it passed out.

unconscious, it passed out. something seethed. it was fully unconscious.
something fissured. something boiled. it fell out.
