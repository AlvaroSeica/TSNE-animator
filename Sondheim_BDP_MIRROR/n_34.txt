i am a fraud a hypocrite can't write obscene i am nightmare
nazi sondheim undergoing shaman transplant operation eyes
in belly eyes in swollen skull:

oh oh you devour my liver oh oh you pluck my eyes you spit
down on me oh oh my skin suppurates scabs and separates
but the tree walks around me and the tree walks around me
on the ledge where i'm suspended oh oh your blows break my teeth
on the ground where i'm tied back to the bark
walking blindfolded is the tree around the ledge of me
oh oh my brains splattered there you see them down there
it is the animal it is the panther i prowl down you see the track
down there the tree in the snow the woods the forest down down
there up up the slope up the treeline jagged rocks
oh oh cut my feet bleed my hands fingers broken claws sharpened
oh oh your words tear my intestines tear my stomach my lips
walking is the blindfold stealing the tree panther there
i'm flying oh oh i'm flying there are cities mountains forests
valleys rivers meadows streams lakes hills canyons caves oh oh
you slice my neck bleeds in spray circling trees bark ledge skin
bark skin ledge skin bark liver ledge liver cut my words in me
cut my words in me white trash loser white trash loser *
shaman then i die shaman then i die oh oh you can tell oh oh
you can tell i don't have my song yet oh oh still don't have 
my song can't sing can't talk can't whisper can't yell oh oh
clumsy me oh oh: shaman, cybermind, cyberspace, shamanic journey,
arctic hysteria, fetish objects, katmandu:

	whirling in front of you,
	it is mourned for,
	the rope of our world

						(yokut)
*he died
