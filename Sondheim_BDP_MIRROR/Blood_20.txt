Samuel Taylor Coleridge, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Part III, 
stanzas 9-11:


Alas! (thought I, and my heart beat loud)
How fast she nears and nears!
Are those her sails that glance in the Sun,
Like restless gossameres?

Are those her ribs through which the Sun
Did peer, as through a grate?
And is that Woman all her crew?
Is that a Death? and are there two?
Is Death that woman's mate?

Her lips were red, her looks were free,
Her locks were yellow as gold:
Her skin was as white as leprosy,
The Night-mare Life-in-Death was she,
Who thicks man's blood with cold.

The Tibetan Book of the Dead, translation Fremantle and Chogyam Trungpa, 
pp. 119-20 Shambhala pocket edition:


"Oh child of noble family, those realms too do not exist anywhere else, 
but lie in the four directions of your heart with the center as fifth, 
and now they emerge from within your heart and appear before you. Those 
images too do not come from anywhere else, but are the primordial spon- 
taneous play of your mind, so recognize them in this way. O child of 
noble family, these images are neither large nor small, but perfectly 
proportioned. They each have their own adornments, their costume, their 
color, their posture, their throne, and their symbol. They are spread out 
in five couples; each of the five is encircled by a halo of the five 
colored lights. The whole mandala, the male and female deities of the 
familieis, will appear completely, all at once, Recognize them, for they 
are your yidams."
