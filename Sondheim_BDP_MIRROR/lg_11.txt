the Name protects Itself, conceals, is spoken with
  a shudder, there are tendrils outpouring from
  the interior of the letters, there are sounds, some
  say noises, seducing you away, towards everything
  spoken in the world (but the Name is not lost among
  them)
& some say to speak It after death is the only speech
  the true speech
& It murmurs in the tongue, and not upon (or the
  slight movements, flutterings, of the tongue)
the Tongue takes over, its nub nudging tongue aside
tongue says, this is difficult to follow, swallow
the Name is the nightmare of all words, the word
  turning, twisting, all on its own, other words
  silenced
in this vacancy the other words call death (but can't
  take it with them)
