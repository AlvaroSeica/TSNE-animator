Skew (by Jennifer)


The sky swells up, ruptures in even striations, waves among incipient
atmospheric fluxes, slight bulge where the belly produces an absence of
signs.

Uncomfortable kyber-body bangs among itselves. Sky leverages, suffocates;
anyone will say there's nothing there. Skin's tight enough to be a window.

"Truly do we know that a mirror was hung up, that jewels were spat out,
and that then an Hundred Kings succeeded each other; that a blade was
bitten, and a serpent cut in pieces, so that a Myriad Deities did flour-
ish." (Yasumaro, The Kojiki, Records of Ancient Matters, trans. Chamber-
lain.)

Sky's a mirror of beautiful cosmos, which is a bleak cylinder at the pro-
jective limit in each and every direction, skewered-the-body. All those
signals up there down here. 

But it is the wind or alter-wind that makes the alter-body, great swollen
belly where you might see nothing in the sky.
