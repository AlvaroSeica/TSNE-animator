[ It's like a drug. Constant writing. Working into the night. Filling

the box. Stretching the limit. It's the way to work. It takes you to

the morning. It takes you beyond yourself. It's your reason to live. ]



( I've got nothing more to say. I've said all I can say. I can't write

about the Net forever. Everything has its limits. The Net has no lim-

its. But I've completed everything. I've finished with it. I've com-

pletely finished. Done. No more. )



{ That's the strategy. Make them believe this. Make them believe any-

thing. Continue to throw it away. The post is its space, the space is

the post. It's our secret. It's our little secret. There's no them.

None at all. }



[ The post is an _ontological operator._ The post is indexical. The 

post runs away with it. The post participates in the _calculus of

cyberspace._ The calculus is ontological or _performative._ The calcu-

lus is epistemological or _indexical._ ]



( This is good. This is the _stuff_ of cyberspace. This is the material

or constitutive order of the same. This is the differend. This is the

concatenation. There's no identity. )



{ This post was reconstituted from disparate packets. This post began 

together and ends together. This post drew me to the limit. This post

draws me out. This post draws me out of myself. Out of myself, the 

stuff of cyberspace. Out of my self, there are no limits. It takes me

beside myself. The stuff of it. The stuff of it all. }
