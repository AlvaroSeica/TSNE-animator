abide to read herwise. But Jennifer-	these words would have told you ot
disassociationeing that belongs no long- is true to herself, a beautiful b
er stretched aureless; you know who you	cross an expanse that remains feat
are, and know scribes black lines in thewhat I am. Her blood, my blood, in
snow. There arain true to the eternal ase writings which penetrate and rem
long as the we that, the other. But thenather's below freezing. Other than

wall where theair, her call, her inter-	 chair was. This was Jennifer's ch
pretation. I rsnow fell out, words in	ested my case against it; opened, 
disarray. Jenn me, and that turning fellifer smiled, turned slowly towards
towards the asymptote of a complete stop as a black hole opened between
us. My clothes fell open, and I could feed her forever. And in that manner
of landscape, breasts worthy of slip-fault, milk: desire in the house of 
death, dead of speaking wires, "Cloth."
