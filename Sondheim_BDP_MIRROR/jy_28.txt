From Jennifer, on the Attitudes of the Arthropods:


Now I will note the attitudes in the time of the arthropods, 
When helmetted Zor ran his lanky legions around the army of Murr.
The golden-haired maiden, with three drops of blood, christianed
The sword of the family of Aral, born of the dank ruins of Drur.
Those times past the ruins of Feggard! Ah for the mead and the storm!
Such moments of these, like the falling of peas, take us away
From the norm!
