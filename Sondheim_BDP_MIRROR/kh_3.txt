Parable


When I, Daishin Nikuko, was frightened of the sun, I would run into the
subway and hide. When I hid in the subway, the sun would disappear; and it
would always disappear in this fashion, white replaced by black and day
replaced by night.

Someone would come and pull me from the subway, someone, my mother Daishin
Nikuko.

I would emerge and it would be day replacing night, white replacing
black, and from this came "cause" and "effect." 

I, Daishin Nikuko, am writing this.
