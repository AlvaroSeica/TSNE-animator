In Tablet 29, well-defined articulated relationships are present, two by 
blood and two textually contiguous: [aSb, cSd]. Thus the name is asso- 
ciated with @parent on the MOO, and name is associated with URL or email 
address, written absolutely elsewhere.

In Tablet 30, classes are present, but the terms slip out from under, in
relation to the practice of gendered institutions which may or may not be
known or relevant. Everything problematizes; even the location, obverse/
reverse for the classes may indicate yet another classification, perhaps
(again yet perhaps) those of wavering gender. Was gender strictly institu-
tionalized or was it simply set in stone? 

On the MOO, @gender changes it, but terms like Spivak still shift. As with
the tablets, there is also an implied categoricity; one can't make up as
one goes along, but instead, one adopts a framework in its totality. We
are perhaps farther from the manifold of queer sex than the Akkadians; if
I knew who I was, I would bet on it.
