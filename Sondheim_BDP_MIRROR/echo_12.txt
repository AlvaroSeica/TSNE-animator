Naked & Despair





SQUEAK speak forever or now hold your peace;

this is your life, you do not have a lease

on any other, your avatars have left,

and you stand ripped, unswarmed, and quite bereft

of all that stripping richness, soil, plough and hoe

that gave you weeds; you've nothing left to show.

there's always nematodes and other forms of worm

alive in wetware minds - they make you squirm -

you fear luxury, petunias, sonnets and cold showers,

while breathing meadows in your dying hours.

your dying seconds are second deaths, and last 

no longer than "Jennifer's" dim past -

which trundles bundles towards the future; we're all there

carrying more than our share of avatar's, where there,

or so I heard, is no there there, their despair bare

in fare glare: stare there nowhere, be fare and bare

their lair; pare their prayer with flair; repair; tear;

care; try dare; don't bear the flare; wear rare hair 

and swear spare mare-hare Jennifare: "try dare, Julair,"

"wear rare hair, Nikukair"
