Uboat


Tap-tapping away, the Joe Jack worked his audience. She stood in the door,
her red dress slit up to where only I was allowed to go. Her cigarette
dangled from her ruby lips, spitting ash onto the floor. Babe, I says. Her
left hand rubs up against the jam, leans hard near where the ceiling
thought to be. Rooms always bent to her; you knew when she walked in -
that the contest was lost, that there wasn't even a contest to begin with. 

The hell with the key. Morse could wait. Ships were sunk at sea for less.
In my mind the transmitter went cold, I went hot, and the world went cra-
zy. Babe, I says, Babe, Babe. 

She responded like a monsoon on a desert island. The Krauts had hit a ves-
sel of ours, I was sure of us. The transmitter chattered like a madman,
and I could hear it, and in that very moment I betrayed my country.
