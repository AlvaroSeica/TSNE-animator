the narrow-gauge rails circled the entire asteroid.
without beginning or end, an equator was inscribed on the ragged surface.
ties were reinforced with titanium studs driven deep into the ground.
the circulation engine was constructed on site.
enormous rockets would push the engine fast in one direction.
heavy gears engaged the titanium studs and ties.
driven by heat, the gears pushed hard in the opposite direction.
the circulation engine resisted tremendous compression.
slowly the asteroid began to rotate against the force of the rockets.
sondheim noticed the gears beginning to saw away at the studs and ties.
the gears cracked and collapsed, welding the engine to the rails.
the rotation of the asteroid slowed to a halt.
the firing of the rockets now welded to the rails had the desired effect.
almost imperceptibly, the asteroid began to rotate in the opposite 
direction.
visibly, it began to pick up speed.
soon a day emerged, an earth-year at a time.
the rockets kept up their furious pace as the day reached an earth-month 
in length.
at the twenty-five hour mark, the rockets spent their last.
the asteroid greeted its new dusks and dawns as the track was dismantled.

scalding water stops the pain for a moment; the hammocks carry blood-lust
in their very atmosphere; thickets are swarms; in dwarf cypress forest or
coastal prairie, one is accompanied by horse-flies, biting midges, wasps,
larger insects from a distance; chills and fevers wake one in night's
thick entanglement; one's body is a mess, suppurating, gouged and gnawed,
split, half-devoured.:deer-flies stinging constantly, the mosquito gouge,
sand midge extract. points of the body, usually ignored as implicit
hinging - elbow, ankle, knuckle - sudden areas of intense pain or scab, as
blood flies near the surface, bone heats up, the insect settles for the
final score. chills and fevers, slight numbing of the body, general
weakness.: :the arms first, then the fevers, the tingling, desire to gnaw
at one's flesh, lacerate onself, cut off the offending bit of flesh or
limb. it makes no difference - one dreams of alligator biting through the
fingers, itch giving way to momentary pain.:knees and shoulders:neck and
