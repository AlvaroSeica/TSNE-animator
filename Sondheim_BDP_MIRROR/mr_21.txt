prey

i write always with textual prey, subject matter; i write what is essen-
tial to me, that is, of the nature of the being or fit of the world -
outside of this i'm weak, comatose, tongue-tied - within it i am dictated 
- i live sometimes in the house of unix - i want to know where i am - 
what's happening there - it's a home i share with others - 

these commands which are single-valued, monotonic - descriptors of the
landscape/langue-scape -

w / who / whoami - the speakers, self, community, active agents -
ls - what's here, what's in my vicinity -
pwd - what's right here, where am i -
date - at this time
netstat - what's distance, what's happening out there -
top - what's closer, what's happening in here -
df / du - the size of the place -
yes - primordial process -
cd - going home
exit - leaving it

then the place - the moment and inhabitation of the place - others near
and far - when the world explodes, they'll be all that remains - they'll
have gone to - electricity out - dead wires, not enough batteries - dead
satellites - burned-out fiber-optic - you'll see - for a moment -
