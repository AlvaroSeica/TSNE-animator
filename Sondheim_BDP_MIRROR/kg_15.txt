Subject: Re: Time changes (fwd)

expand the hours
perhaps 22 will do in which case
you can slide the rest around

those two won't be missed
you can have your time and beat it to
the punch clock which doesn't mind
putting out for a minute
or 120 of them

keep it running past
a couple of hours on the road
let's go slide around
