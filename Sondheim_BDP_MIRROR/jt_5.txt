Al-Mutanabbi says to me (trans. Arberry):

"I sleep in sublime unconcern for the words which wander abroad, whilst
other men are sleepless on their account, contending mightily."

...

"And many a slender blade I have advanced with between the two hosts until
I smote, what time death's waves were dashing together; for the horsemen
know me, and the night, and the desert, and the sword and lance, and the
paper and pen."

...

And I say:

Exactly!
