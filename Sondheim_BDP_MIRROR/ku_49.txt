Hermit and the Emanant: Gloss


"1. Dao has no beginning, yet has a response. When it has not yet come,
consider it nonexistent; when it has come, be similar to it. When an
object is about to come, its form precedes it. Establish it by means of
its form; name it by means of its name. When speaking about it, how do we
refer to it?" (From Designations, _Cheng,_ in, Five Lost Classics: Tao,
Huang-Lao, and Yin-Yang in Han China, trans. Robin Yates.)
