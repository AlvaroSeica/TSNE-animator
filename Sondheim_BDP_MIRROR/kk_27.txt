Emily's Riddle


Sometimes there is a slight pressure upon your shoulder, and you are 
wearing your wonderful dress, and you turn around, and there is a 
slight pressure on your other shoulder, and you hear slight murmurs.
There is a rustling and a beating of wings and the air suddenly loses
weight. And there is the fear of something immense, close and to the
point. What is it?

























An archangel.
