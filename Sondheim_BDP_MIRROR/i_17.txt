Heidegger begins An Introduction to Metaphysics: Why are there essents

rather than nothing? ("Warum ist uberhaupt Seiendes und nicht vielmehr

Nichts?") This question draws forth the same barrier as always; now it is

also a cosmological issue, no closer to the deconstructed Origin. In fact

the questions remain constant, continuous, already present in Aristotle's

Metaphysics - it's only perhaps in the theory of signs, motivated by de-

velopments in logical calculi, that anything like an "advance" has been

made. It becomes necessary to conceive of the work of thinking (somewhat

in the Heideggerian sense) as processes within fuzzy domains. Internal or

neighborhood dialogs are established, with books and other concreted texts

as a form of residue. But the dialogs themselves hurl themselves at death,

only to retreat. The sciences alone (including mathematics) have recogni-

zable progress, based on identifiable and well-definable tolerances; out- 

side, language continues its buzz. Were more texts to survive, say, from 

Sumer or Egypt, it would be even clearer that as Serres would have it, 

nothing is outdated, everything wobbles but the environment which is con- 

tinuing to collapse.



Our neurosis is that we are doomed to repetition; our schizophrenia, that 

we refuse to accept this; our psychosis, that we are blind to it.



For the gods: To have had a body would have been to die.



Thought binds itself to annihilation.



The daemon of Socrates.
