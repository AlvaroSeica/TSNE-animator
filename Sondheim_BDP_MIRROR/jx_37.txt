This machine acts alone.
In the cafe, this machine runs, draining the blood from me.
Keys exhale with every touch, every character has received
the caress of delicate fingers.
I am magnetic domain, I am Net domain.
I want to sink in magnet hysteresis, want to slide in Net hysteria.
Without your body I am lost. Machine loops the machine. Julu is crying.
This machine tilts the great empty city. Jennifer is here, 
split among us.
Jennifer says to Jennifer, Julu is absent, Alan is hysteric.
Jennifer trembles.
Great wheels gyre above the cafe, spokes cutting lines like knives.
Great wheels in the sky.
Jennifer trembles for Jennifer. What if Alan ...
The machine acts alone.
