Apropos 

They become barricades again --
The men disappear woman receives her robe from the Keeper of Gate passes thru
gate backing into robe.
 Perhaps a fan also?Woman goes back to table she onto platform & is there
when lights pick up as tho' had never gone out words feed in one at time
until sentence detached are smoking It broken by girl dancing alone
Notebooks Martha Graham

Nikuko Doctor Leopold Konninger He talking and make no difference -
everywhere muscle against uselessness language returns furniture speaks
nothing happens hammer or stove gun car book? murmuring removing gives
naked thinking about unjustness world

Apropos 

They become barricades again --
The men disappear --
The woman receives her robe from the Keeper of the Gate -- passes thru
gate -- backing into robe.
    Perhaps a fan also?
Woman goes back to table -- she goes onto platform & is there when
lights pick up men again -- as tho' she had never gone out --
The words feed in one at a time until a sentence is detached --
    The men are smoking --
It is broken by a girl dancing alone --

-- from The Notebooks of Martha Graham

It is broken by Nikuko dancing alone --
    Doctor Leopold Konninger is smoking
He is talking and talking and the words make no difference -
lights are everywhere - muscle against the uselessness of language
Nikuko returns to the furniture -- she speaks -- nothing happens
    Perhaps a hammer or a stove or a gun or a car or a book?
murmuring -- removing a robe.
Nikuko gives her robe to Doctor Leopold Konninger -- she is naked --
Nikuko and Doctor Leopold Konninger disappear --
They become barricades again --

-- from Nikuko thinking about the unjustness of the world
