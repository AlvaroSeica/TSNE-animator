read slowly i am forced to _read_ according to the position of the cursor
on the line; nothing comes easily and there is no possibility of skimming.
this is the resistance i mentioned in which the breath of the body is in-
terrelated to the cycling of the machine, input and output. thus the words
are emitted at their own pace and it is as if the inner speech is dictated
by the machine, not by my own subjectivity - which (inner speech) paral-
lels of course that of the other in daily life, the text appearing at this
speed as the development of a _body_ not of a database to be scanned, re-
iterated... 


the speed becomes/is something else entirely - one is held close to the
body of the text / textual body, reader and writer breathing simultneous-
ly, (and hold me),

outcasted from the world of _terminal denouement_
