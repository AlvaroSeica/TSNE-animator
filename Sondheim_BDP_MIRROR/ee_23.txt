Jennifer


I will put a flower on my head
And I will get into my bed
And I will be dead

I will lead me to the slaughter
Up from the attic rafter
Down to the cleansing water

Lost I will never be
Nor kissed slavishly
Nor sung eternally

For I will put a rose upon my face
And I will lie down in my lace
And I will leave you in this place

Not for nothing, calls in winter
Birds in summer, called hereafter
