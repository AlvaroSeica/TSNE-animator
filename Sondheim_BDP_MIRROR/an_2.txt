Near There

In the back of the current 2600, The Hacker Quarterly, although any issue
will do, announcements of meetings, including: "Buffalo, Eastern Hills
Mall (Clarence) by lockers near food court," and "New York City, Citicorp
Center, in the lobby, near the payphones, 153 E 53rd St, between Lexington
& 3rd." The meetings are surrounded by fast food, telephony, quick moves
by ground or car or subway - they're face to face of course, lest likely
for infiltration, not that anything illegal might occur. But consider the
difference between f2f/lowtech/fastfood and hacking _through_ the lines,
perfect image of darknet behavior, movement out of sight, blind movement. 
You can think of Brownian irregularity in fact, skittering across the sur-
face/beneath the surface of _things,_ channels, communities. It coheres.

Physicality of the world intrudes, shuffles as mud covers wires, connects 
break, short out. Hacker to the world moves on, again nomadic only to the 
extent of escape-route/trade-route. She walks across axon-dendrites like 
bulbous ballooned among viral implants. Hi tech to low tech capn crunch. 
Meet her by the TAZ. Over out.
