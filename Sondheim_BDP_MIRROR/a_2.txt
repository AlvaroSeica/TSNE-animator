Subject: Analog/Digital Noise and Reception







I still want to get back to issues of noise and reception in their 

relation to community.



When I communicate in analog and the channel is noisy, I find myself 

leaning towards meta-communicative strategies; I no longer _inhabit_ the 

diegesis or conversational trajectory, but constantly need to recuperate 

the ostensible language itself. This requires hard listening (as in an 

Altman film by the way), and at times I simply ignore the communication, 

which "slips" away.



Digital permits no such strategies (except perhaps for mistaken terminal 

emulations, hi/lo ascii translations, etc.) but creates an annihilation- 

operator; either the channel _is_ or _isn't._ Unlike the real world, one 

gets used to on-line clarity, exhausted and nervous when it disappears 

(see the material on addiction in the Internet Text). And when it 

disappears (through poverty = diskcrash or surplus = meltdown), there is 

no recuperation; strategy floats uselessly in the air, since the 

perceived ground itself has disappeared.



The type of community that results here is based on clarity and 

disappearance of course which touches always already on the issues of 

embodiment that keep coming up. But the ghost-in-the-machine, the uncanny 

(what I called _indexical embodiment_) implies a _partial_ presence, as 

if the analog were (equally always already) a reconstruction. In other 

words, what is fullness when absence is a continuous play at the margins?



Finally, on a superficial level, this is a reminder/remainder of 

biological death as well; the conversation is haunted by its shadow. 

Analog is full of hope and presentiment, since the potential for 

recuperation is present, but the digital, like death, gives us a bleak 

choicelessness in the face of infinite choice.
