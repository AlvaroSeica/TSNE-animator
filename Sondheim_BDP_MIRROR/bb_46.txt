Many many circumstances man

Read the writings I have written after I have died; read it and reread it.
Read the body of my work, the work of my body: You will hear my voice. The
larger the body the greater the voice; the greater the voice, the more the
circumstances. Read the textual body and keep me alive in many many circ-
umstances. 

I will be the Many many circumstances man to you.
