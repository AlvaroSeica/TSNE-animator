God coming down there to the ground

And God came down to the ground, right down to the ground, and he said, 
Dont for a moment think Im a woman I havent a cunt I want to speak to you. 
And God said what do you have to say. And I said nothing because I had not 
an idea what this would want me to say. And God said no one ever talks to 
me wah wah wah no one ever says a word. And I Nikuko have that word that 
is never said. But I would not say it. And God said I am begged for it. 
Still would I say nothing. And God said and I am thanked for it what I 
have not and will have not given. And I Nikuko showed my cunt to God. And 
God said wah wah wah I have smelled this smell and I am on another planet 
far away. And I Nikuko now I said no you are here. And God said Because 
you have a cunt you speak to me. And I had nothing to forgive him for that 
because he said that. And God said wah wah wah I am very lonely. And God 
said Here is this tiny spot of whispers. I did stand away from that spot. 
I Nikuko did stand away from that spot. And I did hear nothing. And God 
said I havent a cunt and you stand away and yet you hear nothing how do 
you hear nothing from that spot when I have spoken and you did have 
knowledge of that speaking. I Nikuko covered myself with blood. And God 
said you must answer me Nikuko because I have come down on ground to speak 
and wah wah wah. I Nikuko covered myself with piss and mud. God said wah 
wah wah I did love mud so why must I have had to make a man with that 
dirty thing. Why must I make a man to piss that dirty thing. Still I would 
say nothing. God said I am always thanked and I do want a thanking no 
little means never any more. I Nikuko covered myself with shit and it was 
my shit and my blood. And I Nikuko covered myself with piss and it was my 
mud. I did make mud. And God said wah wah wah I havent a cunt I will make 
water I will call rain. And God called rain forth and called rain ruin. 
And God said that rain will make water. And God stood in his water. And I 
Nikuko saw that God hasnt a cunt but God has water and shit. And I Nikuko 
stood in Gods shit wah wah wah. And I did anoint my cunt with God. And God 
came down into it. And God said I must want you to have talk with me. God 
did say that to someone perhaps it was me Nikuko. I did say nothing. And 
God said I am a dirty thing. And I Nikuko did say to what is that. And God 
did say that is to me Nikuko. And God did say I am the bind of it. And God 
was the bind of it and I was not. I Nikuko was not the bind of it.

The Different Roof


Julu Twine dances around while God's busy redoing the roof.
They they take a look at prim depth.
Julu's happy that the thing spews different.
God redoes the outdoor prim with glow and texture of breasts.
Julu thinks the whole thing is over-ripe.
God thinks it's fecund.
Julu thinks God's fecund.
There's no end to it.

God and Second Life


"Just read it, and you will find, about the twenty-third verse, that God 
caused all the animals to walk before Adam in order that he might name 
them. And the animals came like a menagerie into town, and as Adam looked 
at all the crawlers, jumpers, and creepers, this God stood by to see what 
he would call them.  After this procession passed it was pathetically 
remarked, 'Yet was there not found any helpmeet for Adam.' Adam didn't see 
anything he could fancy. And I am glad he didn't. If he had there would 
not have been a free-thinker in this world; we should have all died 
orthodox. And finding Adam was so particular, God had to make him a 
helpmeet, and having used up the nothing he was compelled to take part of 
the man to make the woman with and he took from the man a rib. How did he 
get it? And then imagine a God with a bone in his hand, and about to start 
a woman, trying to make up his mind whether to make a blonde or a 
brunette." - Robert Ingersoll, "Mistakes of Moses," in "Mistakes of Robert 
Ingersoll," J. B. McClure, ed., Chicago, 1879.

perhaps her great sadness, and video and image


 her great sadness which never ends, always i knew her
when she was abandoned or her heart eaten out, tonight a nightmare:
what were the dreams of my dead mother, surely they have died with her
and all those rich rooms and intense childhood scenes we shall never
have known, how sad, and how sad that sadness is cliche now, with all
of us and our kind and the kind and kindness of others facing extinction

some come with memories of others offered bartered
what could be given then but creatures warm and floating

many eyes shyly close in comfort and close comfort
many sights to see and many seas are sleeping

WRITE HOME: ACCIDENTS HAPPEN! Poor little avatars hide behind poor
little avatars! Avatars ab/use! Avatars don't need air! You can't
weigh them! They don't know the meaning of the word! THESE avatars
don't know anything! They're weighed down by coordinates! They can't
fuck! Their prims bend, smash! Smashed prims are prims. Hello, hello!
Video and performance spewed from a laboratory of virtual
environments. IN MY WORLD, THERE ARE NO ERRORS, ONLY SEDUCTIONS!

The human figure's place in art gets turned inside out here in this
world of unfolded and refolded geometries. What remains of the body
in the domain of the virtual? What survives the transition? Could
this still be called a body? Where are we going in this crossing over
into bits, why are we going there/nowhere and what does it say about
the nature of human desire?  At what point does a beautiful accident
become a tragic mistake? Is there truly such a thing as a mistake?  

A pioneer in virtual worlds and networked environments, Alan Sondheim
brings his latest work to Odyssey http://odysseyart.ning.com/, an
international community of artists working on 2 servers in the
networked 3d virtual world called Second Life.  An autobiography of
Sondheim's career as an artist can be found here 
http://www.alansondheim.org/COMPBIO.TXT

This exhibit is being presented in the networked environment Second
Life on the Odyssey simulator. To view this work you must have a
Second Life account and avatar, which is free of charge and 
is quick to set up and learn the basic functionality. To set
up an account, go here: http://secondlife.com/ Once you are logged
into Second Life, click this link
http://slurl.com/secondlife/Odyssey/48/12/22 in your web browser and
the Second Life client will teleport your avatar to the location of
the exhibit. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate your
avatar through the exhibit and be sure to press play on both the
audio and video buttons located on the lower right of your Second
Life client.

Thank you!

We are having the performance on Wednesday in Second Life

but she have added new video everywhere sputtering in the miasma called
The Accidental Artist

underwater everything shimmers and boundaries are seen as they truly are
they move, there's no editing to them
there's no gainsay to them and once you speak they've ceased listening,
and once you speak they're already gone

the air and atmosphere, airless and breathless, are beautiful in the upper
