It is Land's End. It is the End of the W- boson. It is the weak
interaction and the very weak interaction. It is the work of my 
arms and my wrists, my hands and my fingers. They don't do this
forever. They lose the unconsciousness of the autonomic. They
begin to fray. The piece, like Zboson.mp3 or W+boson.mp3, is a
continuous fraying and a continuity that promises eternity: the
eternity of the digital, and the eternity of the infinitely-long
form. But this is the curtain and the harboring towards an end,
towards an end which is _the_ end, the only conceivable end. 
That Eye/I in the Tractatus closes for the last time. But listen
to this: that before the closure, it produced this residue, this
residue you will hear if you listen. And that was the work of a
being that had already reconstituted the future. And that is 
what these are about:

http://www.alansondheim.org/W-boson.mp3

and what you may have already heard in the murmurs of my passing, 
in that future already reconstituted, already given, already
the strings of sarangi, sindhi sarangi, and oud, already silent.
