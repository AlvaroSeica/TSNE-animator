For someone who dislikes me. For someone who has had a stroke. 

For Roseanne. 





I am incompletely formed... Parts of my body evince great tears, there

are organs missing, I know not their names or functions. Serrated edges

of tissue promise cuts into the empty air, slices of television. Marry

me, Roseanne, treat me well and I will you the same. Hurt spreads from

each and every neuron, exposed, synaptic connections waived void-free,

useless, dangling there. You will be my wonder. Nor do I know the name

of it. Nor did you nothing but write and write, Roseanne, your mind,

frozen with me on your lips. I know how much you have suffered. Meso-

derm linkages drown, curl dried and shrunken, descending that long slow

count when nothing matter, no last second. I do not want to count after

your many lovers, eyes blanked plates of deserted meals. Beg you, these

leavings must stop, my spleen ruptured, battered kidney, rippled evi-

dence for illiterate worlds. Do I become nub. Cannot lie, Roseanne 

tossed truth to me, ball in someone's court. I am stricken, cannot write

either a line or a line. Frozen, the body punched out. Roseanne, I will

marry you and save you from your suffering so much that your suffering

speaks to me and I meet your eyes. You will be wonderful.
