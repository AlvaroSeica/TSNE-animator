To Everyone - Please Read - the Most Important Message! -


Walking down street with a friend, I noticed her quiet. What are you
looking at, I said, the buildings and the street she replied. I thought
this is not very weird!!!! And then it occurred, the TRUTH: Reality is
fascistic! Because you _have_ to just look at what's there! It is there!
there! there! You turn around, what is there? Just more of it! You step
back, closer to the street - just more! You can't get away from it! It's
everywhere, covering EVERYTHING and it do not let you alone! Something
must be done about it! Why don't people revolt when something like this is
SO OBVIOUS?!! 

Yes yes yes yes yes! Reality is bundle up, and sometimes it just about
smother you! I have close my eyes and open them: It is still there! I do
somersault and get my self all dizzy - but reality still has stuff all
over the place! And I AM SURE if one day I die (and probably will!) that
it will just CONTINUE ON AND ON, with stuff everywhere (not MORE stuff,
but just the SAME AMOUNT of stuff to fill everything)!!

Reality is fascist! We must sit in our New Frocks and DISARM!!!!!!
