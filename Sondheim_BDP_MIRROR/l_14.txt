Hole in the Heart

You make a hole in my heart. My heart is flat like paper. You can write on
the hole. You can write but you better not leave the hole because you'll
hit the blood. When you hit the blood you heat the blood. The hole is
frayed cause the blood's afraid. You can write it there in mid-air which
is the place to write the place to be. I'd rather be there than in the
blood where the words disappear. In the hole the words hold fast. They
hold fast to your fingers. Your fingers hold your hand your arm. Held fast
in the hole you reach deep inside of me. But there's nothing there but the
hole and your hand is clean. Your hand stays clean as long as it's in the
hole and it's going to stay there. And I make sure it stays in the hole,
stays clean, and I make sure it's going to stay there and stay in place.
