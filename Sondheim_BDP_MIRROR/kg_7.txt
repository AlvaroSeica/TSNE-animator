Fellow List-Members!


I am writing you, writing you, to request to you, that at, for example,
let us hold to this, 0500 Hours, Universal Time, or Greenwich Mean
Time, which are the same in this and every other instance, on the 4th
of April, 1998, this very year,

That you all fervently raise your hands into the air, saying: Alan! May
your body lift up from the ground at this very instant!

So that that will happen. And furthermore,

That at 0700 Hours, Universal Time, you will cry: Alan! May your
wonder-texts be read a thousand years! 

So that that will happen. And furthermore, and finally,

That at 0900 Hours, Universal Time, you will shout, with a great shout:
Alan! May your million-dollar life dream come true, so that you will
live in great health and fine well-being!


I do request this as your loving co-moderator of these lists! I do ask
you humbly, and with suitable decorum! As a favor to me! For all I have
done for you!


Now, I thank you forever!

Alan!
