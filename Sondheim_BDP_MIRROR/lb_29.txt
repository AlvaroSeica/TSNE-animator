Ro


When in despair with fortune, Azure all alone,
I caught this morning, morning's minion, close to bone,
Where life is short, the art difficult and long,
Though the harbor, barred, is moaning a dark song:
These are the days which try men's souls, and women's,
Going never gentle into that good night, have summoned
The swollen bell - spilled all, told, but none for thee,
Whose hollowed body moans, not banging, whimpering.
How do I love you, I forgot those young and youthful ways
Good neighbors fenced - and all through such bleak days
I had a lean and hungry look - such men are dangerous
For babes in London, worlds in wildflowers; now Celia
Shits, she's lovely as a tree, I swallow, comfort thee,
What comfort is in me? The times are changing, to be
The apologia: Marion among the lilies, weeping,
Spread herself upon the hill, the sky came seeping.
