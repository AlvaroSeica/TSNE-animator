Mayakovsky's Trolley





						

					Churrrrrr ! Churrrrrr !





The trolley roars down the street !

	Clang ! Clang ! It's filled with soldier's tip-

		pling the bell-cord shearing from the bell !



They're firing left and right, explosions of white mist -

	scattered stone hail pouring like lavender down the street !



		scattered movements bags of cloth and bones !



	Knock !

	 out the street-lamp glass funneled acorn delight-

		ing later on that night during "round-up" time !



It's so gay ! It's almost so gay ! I'd watch

	but for the nickels crashing on the rails or the

		dispersed nickels or the rounded-up

			right nickels and dimes for the gay soldiers !



	Such empty UNIFORMS, tiny empty medals, these are

		Working Cannons cocked for one

				and all and everyone !



		Ways down hall-ways, UNIFORMS blank, while

	the gay little trolley

			the gay little trolley



				goes lurching over the hill bye-bye !



		goes lurching down the ravine bye-bye!



			goes Babi Yar bye-bye !



	O lurching in the midst of agave, yucca ! 

		O lurching in the midst of a reservation !



			O somewhere beneath the streets of Lodz !

				O somewhere teeter-totter hideout !

					O somewhere way beyond the Pale !



				

			Churrrrrr ! Churrrrr !



	The trolley roars down the street !
