Leaving, See You


On See You, See Me, I find myself awkward; my self-hatred results in my
covering up my window (Quickcam image) with someone else's. I lurk; who
would want to talk with me? It's too similar to a party; it's much too
real. After a while, I'll bow out of there, click X on the screen, and
CuSeeMe crashes to a halt; the party's over.

What's unnerving is the feeling that the whole world has just collapsed.
It's not like exiting a MOO with @quit, IRC's /quit or /leave or /bye,
talker's .q, ytalk's ^C. It more like a sudden exhaustion of air; the
universe has just deflated. 

Now what's unnerving about this is how _real_ the stuttering images,
sounds, and tentative gropings on the chat-type become. I see Rebecca
getting ready for class and people saying good-bye to her. Or Don receiv-
ing a call from someone in Iowa testing out the audio bar.  They're all
on first-names; I've walked into a late-night bar all-day long.

So what's unnserving here is that these wonderful people all know and love
each other! They challenge each other! They help each other with personal
tech support! They're in love! 

Now I've just downloaded the demo of Enhanced CuSeeMe - have any of you
used this? Which permits 1/1 conferencing, direct dialup if I can ever
figure it out - and that would be unnerving. So call me up sometime at
166.84.250.149; chances are we won't connect (any more than usual). But at
least we won't be strangers, just disconnected.
