Perfect Fucking Machines


AMERICA is bought by the rest of the world because we generate perfect
fucking machines PFMs, Pulse-Flesh-Modulators designed like Baywatch is
designed for perfect desire perfect moments of leaking writhing bodies. 
We're the best at it, particularly blond/blue-eyed appearing historyless
dominating body types everywhere with more writhing silicon implants,
toned machinic Nautilus muscles. They want us. They want our bodies, not
_my_ body but _our_ bodies, our imaginaries, that's what we produce. Don't
think for a moment it's force, power, oppression entirely - it's also the
desire of the other in perfect matching. Oh, we do it so well. Hollywood
is pure genius, don't mistake it, pure transformation into distended and
swollen holes, penises, aureoles, vaginas, asses, complexions, finger-
nails, cuticles, hair, breasts held perfectly in place, nipples always
erect.  America produces erections; sex inverts, there's no history, no
_culture_ of sex. The world crawls for it, imitates it. It's not merely
the Hollywood machine, it's _something else,_ it's the desire everywhere
breathed.  More and more these hidden facts are covered uncovered over. 
(I'd love fuck her. I'd love to be fucked, by her? By him? I'd love to be 
golden. I'd love to be money. I don't want to be rich: I WANT TO BE HONEY 
MONEY. Make me HONEYMONEY. Make me AMERICAN.)
