 

When I Grow Old I Will Be The Subject Of Understanding


because slowly the world will decathect, it will make no difference if 
one is or is not jacked in, beyond imminent arousal the repetitions will 
dominate beneath a bleeding sun, red-streaked deer will run again through 
the urban wilderness

when i grow old, i will have been understood by myself, now, a terminal 
subject, subjected to the beginning of transformations which are always 
in evidence

such understanding ahead of itself, breathing just barely, breath fogged 
in the wind, stillness up here, lots of movement now there

the mattering a result of reading holding the breath beneath the bleeding 
sun until a revelation that death is never of this world

this world slotting itself through me, drab in its repetitious and
religious running through the urban wilderness

and one two three two one
    one two three two one
