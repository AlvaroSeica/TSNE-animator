when languages are lost we can't speak to each other any more in one word
from early anglo-saxon a line from early western flemish just the gospels
and isolated words from gothic what mitannian news what happens when long
ago cuneiform returns to its originary matrix accounting for your goods
your temples accounting for your herds and families your loving long lost
names connectives unnamed disappearances phaistos disk languages that are
rumors whole people moving about the faces of the earths loves and hatreds
nameless gods precipices of uncanny beauty it is all a tablet scribbled
and erased what happens to the connectives what holds you miryam where do
you go to die a single word or pause someone breathless just around the
corner accrued moments what is spoken where by whom this lost day of the
lost week week month of the lost year motions of harder life you will walk
by the shore in the blessing of the god you will walk by the shore in the
blessing of the god wane wane wane wane wane you will find the pebble wane
wane you will mark it wane wane wane wane wane you will mark the pebble
wane wane wane wane it is a fine acheulian day i will come and visit you
my name is julu what's yours
