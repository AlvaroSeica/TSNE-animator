Doctress N's Expose of Jen's Lies


When Doctress N stayed with me a few weeks ago (having come for the launch
party of the Being on Line book), I screened the Jennifer tape for her. 
Later, in the middle of arguing, she said she knew now that I wore pant-
ies. I said, no, I didn't wear panties; I wore them for the tape and noth-
ing else. (Since she had seen me naked, she should have realized that.)

Where is this going? For one thing, I'm screening the tape tomorrow night.
For another, her reply was that she was an artist, and she never lied in
her art. The assumption, of course, is that wearing panties on tape and
not in real life constituted a lie, a dishonest art, an art of subterfuge
perhaps - which itself was constituted by the fact that the material on
the tape, its content, appeared somewhat _as if_ I was Jennifer, to re-
suscitate Jeremy Bentham's or Vaihinger's conceit.

A fetish requires maintenance, labor, economics, of a different order and
temporality than artwork, which passes literally from hand to hand. When I
think: Jennifer pushes me borderline, I _do_: Alan pushes Jennifer border-
line. There's no hardness, no uncanny gaze, in the text.

But the primitive conceit of the _truth_ of art (i.e. "her art is honest,"
"she true to herself," "she's a fake," "her art's fake," and so forth)
hangs like a phallus over its irreality. (For if art is a discourse, it is
centrifugal, rim-objects at the subject's horizon generating internally,
ec-centric. Truth _swarms._)

Forge a head.
