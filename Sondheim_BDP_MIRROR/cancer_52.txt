impossible to write these days   unsettling gloom, clouds overhead   one
awaits the coming of the asteroid   cancers eating away before the
enormous descent   i dream of crags and peaks approaching   if not that
something mute, suffocated discord, collapsed lungs and bridges   if not
that something else   something unutterable   living on the tip of the
blade   beneath, everything sliding upon the earth   plastics and
microchips   walking out in the street it occurs, just a small stone will
end my world   my body's impossible keeping   to reach anything one has
to use the whip   this switch moves something completely out of sight
the more one learns, the smaller the gains, the less the future   like
great teeth, a future being   that also passes   sooner or later, viruses,
claws, cracked gourds, clouds and never any sun   the comet, the comet,
the plague, the plague   easements   one has to be blind to things, to
being   being's muteness   at night, i try to sleep, i think, asteroid, 
the asteroid
