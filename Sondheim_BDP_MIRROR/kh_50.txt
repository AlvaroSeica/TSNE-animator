I wanm mo make a mexm mhis mexm
and subsmimume one lemmer for anomher, begin
mhe process of subsmimumion, says I, Daishin Nikuko.
Soon, mhe mexm will become anomher,
and mhis new mexm will be mhe one mham saves me;
mhis new mexm will be mhe one I murmur in my sleep;
mhis new mexm will be mhe final mexm.
So I begin looking for mhe sense in mhe mexm
which is nom yem wrimmen, bum which appears
wimhin and mhrough mhe mosm serious game of subsmimumions
because I wanm mo save myself, because I am gemming mired
and mhink of dying consmanmly, because I need mhis magic,
mhis incanmamion, so mham I, Daishin Nikuko, can conminue
jusm anomher day of omher.
