But if I could tell you whether C or D do or do not connect or if I could
tell you whether I connect C and D or do not connect C and D I could give
you an image. 

If I could give you an image I could give you a symbol which would be the
symbol of that image or its signifier. If I could give you several images
and several symbols I could connect one to another or not connect one to
another but if I could connect one to another I could give you a picture. 

If I could give you several pictures I could connect one to another or not
connect one to another. If I could connect one to another I could give you
a belief. 

If I could give you a belief it would be a picture of my belief or it
would not be a picture of my belief but it would be connected. If it
would be connected I would be connected or I would not be connected but if
I were connected I could give you a theory and I would give you a theory.
If I gave you a theory you would give me money and you would give me you
or you would not give me you. If you would give me you I would tell you if
B and C connect or if B and C do not connect.

You would know you.
