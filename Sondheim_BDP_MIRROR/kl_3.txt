True Story of Inheritance


Katagawa Jinko died and Nikuko was put in charge of his manuscripts. She
remembers seeing a list of four men, and his name was the first. It was an
odd name and she had problems reading it. The kanji were dusty and almost
embedded in the wood; everything was close to disappearing, like wood sha-
vings hardly holding their own. She smiled and thought, now I am in charge
of the manuscripts.

She made a true or false answer to a question about one of the manuscripts
- is this a manuscript of Katagawa Jinko - there were three answers, none
of them were yes or no. I was quite upset. You're fooling around with this
famous author's manuscripts, I said; they'll be dispersed. Don't you have
any sympathy at all for the dead. She was contrite in fact at this, and
stopped dragging the kanji behind her in furrows marked almost by a sight
of miniature valleys left by looping trails in the dust, close to unread-
able, and close to disappearing. She'd hold onto the revelation, not
thinking further about it. It was enough; there were clouds of dust in the
sky, a sense of grit, wood-shavings, the kanji worn and chipped. It was
enough that she'd keep them, stop with the multiple-choice giveaways of
Katagawa Jinko's work.
