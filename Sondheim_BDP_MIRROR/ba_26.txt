oppression of the text
tendenz-purity of the text


i only know to murder with language, cauterize with language; there's no 
way the _image_ conveys the deep descent. so i keep my texts are pure as 
possible, wager on their intrinsic interest, staying-power. 

the viking did not die by the word, honor it thereby.
effusions of hidden runes speak speak through angry action
runes speak through angry augury; created before this world's creation, 
runes turned terrible in nobody's hands:

_I write of the incision of the flesh, the words suturing the wound 
opened by the pen._
