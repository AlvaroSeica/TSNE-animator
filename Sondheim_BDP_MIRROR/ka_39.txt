N. B.


There's a bomber in our midst, here in Fukuoka. He works for a secret
army of terrorists supporting various anti-imperialist causes. He uses
several names, having been given the nomenclature of the Empire, hav-
ing abandoned it.

Lately he's taken to carrying packages into the teacher's room at one
of the universities here. Left behind, they almost always contain
lunch-food (bento, bread, brie, beer), and, as if in excess or resi-
due, a kanji dictionary, perhaps kanji to romaji or kanji to english -
perhaps english to kanji or romaji to kanji. The outer rim, english to
romaji, romaji to english, seems to be ignored. Seems to be.

I can imagine the kanji-strokes up in flames, violation-samurai-kanji
piercing tetsugaku, philosophy, hard and heated killing as english-
as-foreign-language teachers go up in flames and sharpnel. Already
fear strikes the students; I have heard tales of New York, Boston, Los
Angeles, although the bomber is from _elsewhere,_ I might say, his
phials cloistered in innocent refrigerators on several campuses.

Me, I'm lonely, waiting for something to happen. Out of the charred
flesh, the perfect reader will emerge. I'll have my texts settled once
and for all.

But until then...
