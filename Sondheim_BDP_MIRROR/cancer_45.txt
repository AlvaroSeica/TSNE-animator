the text


this is not the text but the bones of the text
this is the text split, splayed for modification
this is the trembling text, waiting for your touch
this is the vulnerable text, the languid text
this is the text that will do anything for you
this is the text that is open for you alone
this is the text that gives itself to you
this is the text that is your thing

i say "this is not the text but the bones of the text"
i say to you "this is the text split, splayed for modification"
i bare myself to you "this is the trembling text, waiting for your touch"
i say "this is the vulnerable text, the languid text"
i talk to myself "this is the text that will do anything for you"
you tell me "this is the text that is open for you alone"
you say to me "this is the text that gives itself to you"
you offer me "this is the text that is your thing"
