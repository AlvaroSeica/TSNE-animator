they come together


the flesh fell from their bodies - the pulling down of everything pure in
life - every one had their hands and feet hacked off - the tumescence of
life - stuttering within and stuttering without - their mouths and eyes
kicked in - it was impossible not to step through rotting flesh - slow
bullet life - they were still alive when these things happened - within
the scent of slow lozenge life - penises stuffed in their mouths - within
the scent of slow death - protruding and parasitic emanations - we're born
programmed with inconceivable madness - i swear there's never anything
else to say - shuddering and swollen - coagulations of bullets and
lozenges - i swear there's nothing else to say - beyond pleasure the pain
- blood poured from her mouth - his skin burned from his body - the
swellings far too painful - i swear by god this is the truth - or they
distended - sores across labia and scrotum - the children ripped in two -
he'd lost half his jaw - the lungs - it emanated from the breast - they
were hacked in pieces - it emanated from the prostate - they were
repeatedly raped - her breasts hacked off - the tumor spewed - the shapes
engorged - they were set on fire - the flesh fell from their bodies - the
pulling down of everything pure in life - every one had their hands and
feet hacked off - the tumescence of life - stuttering within and
stuttering without - their mouths and eyes kicked in - it was impossible
not to step through rotting flesh - slow bullet life - they were still
alive when these things happened - within the scent of slow lozenge life -
penises stuffed in their mouths - within the scent of slow death -

movements of the lozenges - their tongues cut out, they screamed - someone
had cut off his nose and ears - the waves of murmurs - beyond pleasure the
pain - blood poured from her mouth - his skin burned from his body - the

it emanated from the vaginal area
her breasts hacked off
the tumor spewed
it emanated from the breast
they were hacked in pieces
it emanated from the prostate
they were repeatedly raped
her hair shaved off
it emanated from the vaginal area
her breasts hacked off
the tumor spewed
the shapes engorged
they were set on fire
it shaped and grew
their eyes gouged out
it swelled or it was veering
the dead and only world
bullets moved on it
they'd been hacked to pieces
bullets moved on it
they'd been hacked to pieces
fell through the rotting corpses
or the tumor swelled
fell through the rotting corpses
or the tumor swelled
it swelled or it was veering
the dead and only world
