Well, I have been busy. I have been reading poems, writing to a singular
audience, filtering texts through dimly conscious moments where the hinges
turn against the world, not the door.

As a member of the old guard, Atama ga itai n desu, which I read means I
have a headache. And furthermore, I might add, Karada ga darui n desu, My
whole body feels heavy and tired. 

Is there indeed anything more to say in this heaven and hell that refuses
to average purgatory? 

Ah, psychosis would have taken me away. (As a list-owner.)

An education festers here. Cornucopia, panoply, fecundity, abyss, void.

Although it seams otherwise, I don't like talking. I sit in silence lis-
tening to the murmuring of the world. But then I amplify, regurgitate, it
comes out anyway.

Although it comes out, it's sealed by seams, folded over, the words care-
fully hidden. As a list-owner, I'm good at hiding things. There's a col-
lection down there, but I don't want to show you anything.

I notice my skin's translucent and not very funny at the moment. I'm cov-
ered in blue velvet but the lights are out. Mention some list threads
we're fond of. This isn't one of them, but I'm one of them. I'm an assay
in the making.
