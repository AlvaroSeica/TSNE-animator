Spirits





If I feel the spirit move within me, what is it that is moving, so they

say. What is moving within the moving, what is the moving moving within.

So they say, the spirits, that they move within me. What are they, that

they move, that they move within me? What is it that they say?



They say that mankind and womankind are sick. They say there are species

and the species are sick. The spirits are sick, no one says them. They

say they are unsaid. They are sick with the unsaying and the European 

nations are sick. The European nations are no longer European, nor are

they nations. They are spirits moving, spirits moving across me. My eyes

close upon them, these movements of mankind and womankind sick with

spirits, the sickness of European nations.



They chant the nations repeating the spirit within them moving, so they

say. What is moving within them, the nations are saying, that they move

within them. What are they, these movements within them, me, saying the

sickness that is the saying. 



Language is sick with the saying of it. There is language and language,

there is more language, all of it saying and continuing to say. The

spirits say there is language, but I do not feel language within me.



I feel the language in the fields and in the neighborhoods, I feel the

language in the neighborhood of nations. There is ocean-mountain lang-

uage and desert-prairie language. I feel the language of the dunes and

wadis, there I feel the spirit.



I feel the dune-wadi language and return with the spirit into the sick-

ness of the European nations. Go figure, they say to me. Whatever, they

say as well. Go figure, whatever.





Backwards and forwards through the gateways of simulated worlds, there

can be suffering beings in all dimensions.
