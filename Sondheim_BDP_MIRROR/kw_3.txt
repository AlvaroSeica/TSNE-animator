how i see my work on the level of deepest down


following the paths until they unfold at the extremes
 (brilliant extremes, the diffuse specificity of flowers)
splaying body and consciousness to the point of disappearance
 (opening myself up to the lure of the reader, hir scent)
occupations, circumscriptions
 (taking over territories of language, flesh, dreams and hardened reals)
fulfilling the formations
 (playing the games of imitations, philosophies, sexualities, mining)
fulfilling expectations all too well, wait a minute
 (perhaps something else, something unwholesome, where truth lies)
perfections of positions
 (world everywhere around the hollow of the one and the other)
undercuts, undertows of positions
 (where the truth lies, it is always dirty)
wait a minute
 (wait a minute)
refusing to cheat either of us
 (a textbook of thinking on how to see and hear)
submergences and emergences
 (taking on myself the discomfort of the soiled, logical substructures)
masterworks of preparation
 (brilliant writing resonating with brilliant writing)
the future anterior and the warding off and on of death
 (writing my hold on existence, writing myself out of death)
