How The Doing Is


I have no sense of time at all. I quote a cause for the effect, effect
for the cause. I will have A influence its predecessor B, who has yet
to be born on this earth.

I will connect C and D who have never met, have nothing in common,
speak different languages, and eat different foods.

I will rub a theory in its contradiction until both are polished.

Until both are demolished. I will create contradictions for a theory
which are a theory. I will create a theory of contradictions and
contradict such a theory.

I will reverse time and invert space. I will disassociate space from
itself, emphasize its discontinuities, only to suture its continuities
and dissolve both.

Time will not be gainsaid. I will quote one and then another theory
which contradict each other. I will adopt the tenets of both. I will
take one theory as an authority for the reader and take another theory
as an authority for the writer and then reverse the two and their
consequences.

I will start from the end and finish at the beginning, or I will
finish at the beginning and then start at the end. I will do both or
neither, one or the other in each and every order, as more times and
spaces and theories and readers and writers accumulate.

I will insist I am the author of the writer, and I will insist that I
write the author.

I do not care for contradiction in any way or any case. I do care for
contradiction, in every way or no case whatsoever.

I have every sense of time, every sense of space. I quote one cause
for another, one effect for another. I make chains of effects and
causes, the latter following the former, the former following the
latter. It makes no difference.

I will or will not connect E and F.
