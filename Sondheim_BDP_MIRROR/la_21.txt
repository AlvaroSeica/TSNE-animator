Suicide Note


If I don't write well, I want AZURE to kill me!
I want her first to cut off my fingers so I can't type for help!
I'll ask her to cut off my HEAD so I can't yell either!
Everything I write is the very last thing I'll write!
This is the very last thing I'll write!
I'll have Azure to stand over me, HACKSAW in hand!
Am I desperate enough, YES YES I'm desperate enough!
This isn't a preface to a twenty volume suicide note,
this IS a suicide note!
That is, if I don't write really well now!
She'll tear out my eyes and take away my VERBS!
Look, I can't MOVE or THINK!
VERBS are terrific, I couldn't WRITE without them!
Azure, HELP HELP! I'm beginning to lose it!
[FEAR SETS IN!] I'm frightened Azure, this is the end!
Now see, I'm writing well, intense and DESPERATE as usual!
I'm escaping my fate, my HEAD'S intact (well, almost!)!
This has got to be my BEST, there now, I can sleep!
AZURE, wake me in an hour, I feel a TEXT coming on!
Honey, don't kill me YET, I'm really desperate this morning!
Look, BLOOD!
