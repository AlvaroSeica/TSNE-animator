Brief note


While I'm on no mail, besides contemplating the vagaries of James Ellroy, 
I've been thinking about books like Herz' Surfing on the Net, Sullivan's 
and Bornstein's Nearly Roadkill, Sirius and St. Jude's How to Mutate..., 
etc. 

I am amazed at the logic, passing for radicality, in all of these works.
I am amazed at the presence of the _same_ ideological structures in all of 
them - as well as in Wired magazine itself.

These are harbingers of a new dulled prose, a prose in which working and 
reworking, beating to death, frameworks such as chat or email seems suf- 
ficient to give a glow of literary edginess. (I'd place Saarinen's and 
Taylor's Imagologies - still in print! - in this category as well.)

Hypertext wouldn't save these; what's missing is the _language_ - we're 
at the dawn of the millennium, of new and virtual subjectivities, and 
we're rewarded with all the baggage of modernist rationalism in sentence 
structure, fragmented plot, etc. etc. No wonder Burroughs and Joyce are 
held in such high esteem! And Sterne's almost forgotten!

It's as if Irigaray, Cixous, Jabes, Celan, Blanchot, Wittig, Kristeva, 
the Barthes of Lover's Discourse, were writing in pure absence - it's as 
if we've got to take America: Love it or Leave It! everywhere on the Info 
Highway, also called Infobahn as a slight bow to Europeans who want a 
piece of the action!

There has to be more! Literature isn't composed of a shoving match to see
who can adopt to the new forms (yes, even formalisms!) first! As if inter-
iors no longer counted! - as if the forms themselves had no _effect._ 
It's too easy to skitter across these surfaces <click>
