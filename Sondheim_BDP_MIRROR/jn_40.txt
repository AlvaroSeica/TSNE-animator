Dirty Secrets, Dirty Nature, Dirty Nature of Dirty Secrets


Given the nature/culture division;
given the dirty/clean division:
we have incommensurable inscriptions here, passing as bifurcations:
dirty nature (dirt beneath a plant / saps within a plant)?
clean nature (ocean, sea, longing of pond)?
dirty culture (lumpenproletariat, _other_)?
clean culture (homebase)?

So that the categories appear not to apply, but;
we have incommensurable inscriptions here, passing as bifurcations:
trashed nature (intersection with dirty culture)?
cleansed nature (intersection with clean culture, suburbia)?
stripped nature (second-growth forests)?
stripped culture (bricolage)?

So that the categories appear dissolute, but;
we have further incommensurable inscriptions, passing:
female nature (male <feminine stereotyping>)?
male nature (red in tooth and claw masculine stereotyping)?
female culture (masquerade <feminine stereotyping>)?
male culture (masculine stereotyping)?
or dirty females cleansed males <fascisms, Leviticus>?
or dirty males cleansed females <sports, cheerleaders>?

So that we have prejudices, stereotyping, divisions always already askew. 
And so of course our divisions are faulty; I was led to this through a
consideration of _dirty nature,_ one might consider _dirty fish_ as well. 
Here is a site always deconstructed, yet intersecting with doxa, the they,
everyday life. The assertion is _that on the other hand._ The assertion is
not _that on the other's hand,_ which may be the left hand, the hand left
behind, as well as the hand behind the back - or the left hand, which I
write with, re/produce as instrument, my dirty little secret.

I would say that division depends on inscription, that categories are not
always complementary, that a null set is not always a null set. I would
also say that the problem of division is: Who is holding the mirror of the
other? Who is otherwise holding?

The universe preserves chirality.
