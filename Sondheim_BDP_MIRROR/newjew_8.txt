On (severe) Pain

(dialog between Sandy Baldwin and Alan Sondheim)

In relation to pain:

Inexpressibility occurs because of the difficulty of expressing 
interior states that might not have a clearcut symptomology (as 
thirst does, for example) - and also because severe pain derails 
speech and language and thought, as the internalized horizon of 
the flesh is muted or screams in abeyance. All of this touches 
on the _pain of the signifier_ and its inexpressible relation to 
death - (Alan)
