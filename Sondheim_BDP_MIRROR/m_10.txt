in the mountains, last


i'm in the mountains. it's dark. i can't see anything.
i decide to go north. there's reason to go somewhere, and there is no
reason to go anywhere in particular.
north, i say.
you can't go that way, it says.
it might say there is a mine there or a cave there but i can't feel it.
it's large whatever it is. i can't see the ceiling.
look ceiling.
you see nothing special.
there may be a rustling there but i can't hear it. i decide i'm outside.
west, i say.
you come to the mountains.
west, i say.
you come to the mountains.
west, i say.
you come to the mountains and there is a dead bird, shunted from another
space, and it is black and glistening. the center of its body shimmers.
look center.
you come to the mountains.
enter center.
you come through the mountains. you may be in the mountains. you hear
the sound of children dreaming. the children are dreaming disturbing 
dreams.
enter dreams.
you enter the dreams of the children. there is the sound of wings.
listen.
you hear nothing.
listen.
you hear nothing.
listen west.
you hear the sound of wings.
