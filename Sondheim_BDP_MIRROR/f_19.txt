why o gods

the more i want to learn the more you turn away from me

the more i beseech you with my words, the more your silence wounds



i write again and again about my artificial life

you burn out on language, oh technique



my words dig deep into the essence of things, 

layer after layer unfolds, you remain silent on the surface

yea, silent in the depths as well



"from purusha, viraj was born, and from viraj, purusha was born"

(rig veda, x, 90)



from the rocky, earthen surface of the ocean, the fish floats

in the sky. a little air kills, o gods.



"he carried speech across first. when speech became free from death,

it became agni (fire). agni, having stepped beyond death, shines."

(brihadaranyaka upanishad)



worse is to talk. far worse is to talk to oneself. the waves are

ripples from a center at a distance worse than infinite.



begging for precise language, my mouth hungers after the little rice

remaining. empty, i send your thoughts to me.



the sexuality of the first is illusion. the sexuality of the second 

is the first. the sexuality of the third is speech.



why o gods

the more I want to learn the more you turn away from me
