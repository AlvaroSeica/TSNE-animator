Lieu


The first Lieu runs as .htm, cutting/incising into the textual body; it is
lieu.htm. The second Lieu substitutes language for html, transforms other
sections of the texts, results in a breathing-apparatus. The first places
text between < >, as with a block of granite, sculpted away; intermediate
sections between <text> and </text> are visible. Formally, using <!-- and
--> locates comments, but browsers tend to ignore extraneous uninterpret-
able commands. 

Thus a document can be written to be doubly read, one way with .htm ex-
tensions, and one way without; further, it can be additionally encoded as
well, so that, saving it as .txt then results in another document that can
be moved to .htm. Over and over again, things thicken, take on attributes
of the book of the world, dense, particulate, broken or sheared, _talus_
sloping nowhere.

The breathing-apparatus of the second Lieu/place places Jennifer at the
heart of commands; the text is no longer performative, but mimics the body
constructed by repeated sed 's/foo/bar/g' commands. The first Lieu pro-
duces the second; in creating the second, I am well aware of the _body of
the text_ itself, sed an operator _onto_ totality, the text hidden as I
shuttle back and forth between twin files, churning itself according to
the pronouncement of surgery or suture: sed 's/foo1/bar1/g' < z1 > z2, and
sed 's/foo2/bar2/g' < z2 > z1, etc. What results is a simulacrum of the
hysterical embodiment of attempted speech, Jennifer-Alan-suppuration.

By way of explanation, in place of / Lieu.
