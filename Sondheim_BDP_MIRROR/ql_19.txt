7. 'purity' of structure. I am playing something and the doing and undoing 
of structure is of the purity of structure, undermined and presenced with 
and among the abject. The purity of structure is the purity of the world; 
in this sense the world is always (already) pure, just as wave equations 
and quantum fields are pure. We drift towards greater levels, macro-levels 
in the world, ignoring the fine-structure or seething granularity that 
constitutes the cosmos - ignoring (for it appears deeply unknowable and 
irrelevant) the generation of dynamic objects and information, from which 
or of which, we may be, along with those objects and information, only 
projections at a distance. So a purity of structure, seething structure 
always (already) under deconstruction, is the constitution of the cosmos 
within which we play, unknowingly, that constitution and its harmonic
deconstruction.
