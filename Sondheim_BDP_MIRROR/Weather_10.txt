More outlining on a talk about net-sex coming up -

By "imaginary": pre-Oedipal, inchoate, pre-Symbolic. By "symbolic": 
readable/writable, placed within a well-defined framework/structure.

1 Mandeville and others developed an imaginary in regions negated by 
bodies (i.e. no reports coming in).

2 The imaginary becomes filled/fulfilled with narrative, projections and 
introjections; the symbolic dominates. The he/she/it. (Presence of the 
mathematics of grotesquerie: structure steps in where the imaginary fears 
to tread.)

3 On the Internet, if I don't speak I'm not present.

4 In Net sex, if I don't speak, I'm spoken-for; my existence is in your 
hands. My desire is spoken-by the other. (Resemblance to phone sex.)

[My body is your control. My body is cut and sutured, cumming returning 
it _as if it were_ mine.]

5 In Net sex, the symbolic tends towards the imaginary which dominates: 
one develops a symbolic in regions negated by bodies.

6 The symbolic narrativizes, projects and introjects; the imaginary 
dominates. The I/eye.

7 In Net sex, language turns towards substance with cumming: hhhhh...

8 Net sex is the wryting of the unconscious. On the Net, hysteric embodi- 
ment complements disembodiment and the presence of terminal-bodies.

9 Net sex shares with the therapeutic and the emergence of archaic fanta-
sies as the self is destructured. 

10 Physiology of arousal, of cumming, of typing, of trembling, of wet 
hands and fingers: the real returns as well.

11 It is all sourceless, machinic, but it is _not_ cyborg, only 
prosthetic flesh in emergence.
