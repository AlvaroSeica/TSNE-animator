virtual sign


shit-silver flows thru my veins, shit flecked with filthy lucre, shit
contaminated by paper smears, ball-pointed inks coating tunnels to
foreign countries. signs cost money, trade-marks copy consonants for 
their own pleasure, dance-g / dance-d: ive got vowels for you, some
ones bought apostrophe. virtual cash dances virtual cash worth more
than the paper its printed on. only the shit is real with shit-silver
flecked holes where some time there was a standard. cant read stock
certificates smeared with flesh rubles and your cum so trade them in.
youll dance on my grave eh, but its not worth the paper you wipe your 
self with. oh me, ive already starved to death, shit goes only so far
and theres paper poisoning around. you can smell my body a mile away,
you can smell me cumming. ive got your options ready for you to sign
too. theyre for the sign. in other words, he said, jennifer reported, 
youre paying for your signature. virtual not quite. someone will want
you. someone always does.
