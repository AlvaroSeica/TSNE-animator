powerhouse description sets you right in the action


o drugged jennifer so beautiful in your beige skirt and white blouse
o drugged bedraggled jennifer wonderful in your black stockings
o drawn and desolate jennifer in your sumptuous black boots
o jennifer swallowing the air that was alan
o jennifer finishing the perfect perl program
o jennifer winding the ribboned scroll, entering lines of code
o jennifer going to file then run then run

"o beautiful drugged jennifer, i want to be your vicodin!
i want to be your whiskey, i want to be your cigarette!"

with fury she swung at the quivering face barely visible. 
out of the corner of her eye, the scroll rose in the air, white letters
flamed against black sky.
the scroll swung into an empty space where alan was, crashing towards
the white shag floor.
her teeth fastened on the space where his penis had vacated the warmth
of jennifer's body.
her arms tethered the knife slicing away at alan's wasted breasts.
deep within her, a crash was heard and the white floor suffered an
indentation.
the letters howled from the scroll as the learning perl book flew from
the shelf, crashing red and bloody on the floor.
american woman the long live version played to the short dead thing
embedded in the white shag rug, already past three a.m.
jennifer walked out of jennifer.
jennifer walked out of there, where jennifer walked out.

"o beautiful drugged jennifer, i want to be your vicodin!
i want to be your whiskey, i want to be your cigarette!"
