dreaming of white gauze again, lips tied into place,
severed from the body, appearing to emerge, there's always
the first word, slight tumescence of the cloth,
a definition of smothered language, body arched upwards,
hollow beneath the back (where the back would be),
it's an outline of white gauze, it's always damp, as if
excretions were somehow caught up in all of this,
head bending backwards speaking upside-down, all sounds
are coming-out sounds
sdnuos tuo-gnimoc era
i will be a dash caught in a mesh, i will be a period
coming to an end
