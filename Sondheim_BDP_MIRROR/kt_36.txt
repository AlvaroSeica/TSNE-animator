my name is Jennifer. I'm the most beautiful woman You will ever meat. I
have luscious breasts for the boys, and my ass just asks for it and it
really does. I have long blond perfect-hair and the biggest widest smile
in the whole USA. I want to cripple You. I want to call You crip. I want
to see You suffer the way You'd make me suffer. my legs are long and won't
quit. You know I smell that smell. You know I walk that walk. You are
ugly. You are ugly. You are not my friend. my skin is smooth, my cunt is
hairless, just the way You like it. my knife cuts Your balls, but I'll
leave them hang by a thread. my teethy are white and even and glint on a
very sunny day. Your rotten flesh offends me. I'll make Your eyes hang
from Your eyes. I'll strip You, You'd like to strip me, wouldn't You. You
You You, that's all You ever think of. My face lights up Your day.

There is consciousness in every little thing. Everything is elsewhere,
everything is desecrated. Bless every little thing, every scrap of paper,
every used condom, every pebble on the beach, every wildflower on the way
to winter. Bless this world, for it is all the world we have. Bless it,
bless it, bless it.
