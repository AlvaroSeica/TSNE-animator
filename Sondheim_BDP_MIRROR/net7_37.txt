SPRAY





The relationship between chaotic distributions and a totalized phys-

ical source of emission is prominent in a class of words character-

ized by the format [<s><C1><V><C2C2><er>] as in the following 

list: _stutter, stammer, scatter, shudder, shatter, spatter, sputter, 

skitter, splatter,_ etc. (_Scanner_ inverts the series, _spackle_ and

_simmer_ transform it.)



A second similar form produces: _spew, skid, scud, spot, spit, 

split,_ etc. These forms are constructed around a _lateral topo- 

graphy,_ a laminar spray distributing over a more or less wide and 

irregular domain. The spray possesses a phenomology of dissolution 

and disruption; it also exists on the fuzzy interface between 

interior and exterior, and hence involves abjection. 



In every instance, the body is compromised laterally, a veering from

side to side, or the stammer from the region of the throat. Some-

thing is _withdrawn_ violently from the organism, which convulses. 

Convulsions shatter, fragment.[1]



The lock-up of the terminal screen in Net communications is the 

result of packet flow; email appears from everywhere; interrupts are

common; the Net harbors impeded laterality. Better to consider it a

convulsive body as well, the neural interconnectivity of nodes

serving as obstructed gateways choked with binary debris. The body

migrates to the edge of consciousness, received and processed by

one or another correspondent who circumscribes the messaging, 

returns it to the relative fulfillment of sense.



The return occurs within an insriptive domain, part and parcel of

a potential well where meaning is construed. Within the well, 

meaning develops the ontological being of language; without it,

meaning sputters, its attributive scattered among the remnants of

indirect addressing. 



Only the shuddering of the human shatters the human; the human

stammers or stutters its way through debris scattered across the

splattered or spotted landscape. Deep within the throat the 

promise of a primitive root is murmured or mumbled. Culture con-

structs itself upon the elimination of debris; the abject, now

gathered within the shamanistic fetish for the expulsion of male-

volent spirits, echos in the hiss of the cat or snake. These

animals are regarded with awe; they hold the mirror to culture

itself, the thin veneer of language and civilization binding us

to the symbolic. The hiss is imaginary; having no meaning whatso-

ever, it holds the meaning of the world. There are no boundaries

or borders, beyond what we make of them. There is no language 

beyond our speech of it.



[1] See *Art Papers* 1/2 1994, "Throat: Leslie Thornton's _The

Great Invisible_": "_In the film,_ speaking is caught in the maw,

glottal stop, Edison and the _mechanical_ insignia of existence.

Early [20th-century] representations [of movement] operated with 

mechanism throughout [as in the mechanics of the melodrama]; they

stuttered. Repetitive pistons and cams moved locomotives and film;

intermittent motion is translated into rotary motion and back 

again. Throughout the century, mechanism gives way to electricity,

which gives way to the electronic, cyberspace and beyond. Thought

leaves the material domain" ...



If _beings_ are mechanism, _Being_ occupies an uneasy territory.

Aristotle stumbled through the part-objects of a generalized symp-

tomology of the world and Pliny followed suit. But organism never

spoke clearly and _always_ stammered; the hiss of steam, the

volcanic fissure, and the cat are _identical_.
