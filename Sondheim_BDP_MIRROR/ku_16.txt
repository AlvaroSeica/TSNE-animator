Explosion of Misery


It's clear, says N., that the world will come to an end, if not
this billennium, then the next, or the next after that, or the next
so, It's clear, says N., that the total of human experience and hope
and all our welcomes and best wishes - there will be the suffocation
of a curtain closing, falling to pieces in the ruined theater -
the world heading towards ground zero, ground zero everywhere in the
world -

It's clear, says N., everything else is a momentary pause or plateau,
in what's called non-equilibrium thermodynamics, the world held up just
a second longer by breath - we won't be around to look for the great
death - it will be us - so there's no point in struggle - it's going
to fall apart in the end - in the very long run, It's clear, says N.,
the mathematics is clear, absorption at ground zero, absorption -

That's the story, says N., that should be told, so a few of us can hear 
it -
