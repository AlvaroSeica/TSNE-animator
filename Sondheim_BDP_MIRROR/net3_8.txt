z is a particular construct, the thrust or interpenetration of the

screen, the simulacrum of the breast or ultimate coordination which

cannot be surpassed. Just as the horizon of Greenland up to the

Central Ridge is always tilted, white against white, a blindness

sliding the uncanny, so the screen is almost always angled against

the real, even if perpendicular default. The real WEDGES ITSELF.

The real TURNS AWAY FROM YOUR EYE.



There are no conclusions except to note that ASCII is neither visible

nor invisible and that the diagrammation of the screen subverts

thought into exhaustion. In its presence I cannot sleep at night; the

real, projected within/against its backdrop, shimmers and devours the

existential. The real spews; its lines are occluded, always fluid,

imaginary. Thought is this problematic thinking-of-itself through

inscription; inscription NATURALLY enough inscribes only itself. The

above diagram is NOT a representation of the dream-screen; IT IS THE

DREAM-SCREEN ITSELF. This is what is meant by ontology, and this is

also the meaning of the ontological or imaginary/uncanny absence of

the net. (Thus what I WRITE HERE IS INSCRIBED THERE BY A TRICK OF THE

NET; what is here is REWRITE ONLY, a rewrite which is necessarily

sourceless IN SPITE OF the diagram.)



*You sleep, dream. Your thoughts are troubling; bodies intermingle

*with bodies, pleasure is always deferred, always problematic. Flesh

*gleams with unfettered desire. There is no sun and there is no

*horizon; there is only a maroon backdrop in a state of continuous

*dissolution. What is a womb. The rectilinearity GUARANTEES VOLUME on

*the order of **xyz** but your eyes are starved for Greenland, your

*eyes are dense with the dust of the desert, your eyes are always

*before and always beyond; they code and decode; they code **xy**;

*they code an arena of interpenetration. Throughout the thinking of

*this and the presence and pleasure of this, I reiterate the screen

*(see diagram above, see SCREEN above) which is a REWRITE always a

*placement: this is your thinking through which is your REWRITE, a

*screen or address-location, a label to be filled with name,

*address, telephone, measurements of your body, detailed description

*of genital organs and other instrumental secrecies transformed into

*something or someone always elsewhere.*



Blonsky on Baudrillard (*American Mythologies*): `He thinks real life

is something you can choose to see or not see. You zap the homeless,

but you also zap all human relations. And when you don't zap, what is

seen isn't the real, it's a flatter version of it.' And what is a

flatter version of it exists, as I have shown, as conclusively as

logic will admit, upon or within the diagram above, a diagram which

is a curlicue, something explained over and over again in INTERNET

TEXT. If the curlicue is the surplus of the signifier, it is also

that which is an extrusion from or within the real. The diagram

replaces the symbolic it encapsulates. Desire circulates freely

within the rectilinear; `desire' is perception itself.



Could you possibly believe this, and what is the screen it is read

upon? NOTHING PREPARES YOU FOR THE IMAGINARY, a form of preparation.



And I am satisfied to have pointed out nothing less than the 

POLITICAL ECONOMY of REWRITE itself, the fact that



    xyz = xy = k        where k is a constant, to all intents



and purposes normalized to `1'. A certain degree of containment or

ratio sets in; z disappears (as ready-made), and x and y are of

course inversely proportional which only implies the preservation of

`relative' area. Everything is open to question. REWRITE is a space,

a screen-space variable dependent on terminal emulation, address,

recognition, and protocol. The screen leaves its positionality

without a trace. If I do not make myself clear, it is for this

reason: BEYOND the diagram, everything collapses. And I must send

this whole thing to myself, once again, before it comes crashing down.
