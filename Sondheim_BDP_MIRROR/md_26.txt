sad poem of propriety and sentiment


the last lonely man breathes the last free air.
he meets the last lonely woman and she is singing.
she is singing about clean and pure air.
she says

the air is always clean,
the air is always pure.
we are creatures in this lonely world.
we never obeyed, we always breathed.
in and out, in and out,
and we're still here, and we're still here

the last lonely man breathes the first free air.
he has awakened from his slumber and he knows
that the last lonely woman is singing the truth,
oh why did no one listen?
oh why did no one listen?

there's a voiceover with a beautiful voice.
the voiceover says
everyone was scared to get sick and die.
everyone was scared to breathe.
so everyone held their official breath
in their official space,
and everyone died of fear and suffocation,
and everyone died of fear and suffocation

the last lonely woman said nothing's true,
you're making it up again, just like before.
in truth, billions of us are living,
we're not lonely at all, we have good times,
i come back from shopping and this is what
happens.
get me out of this poem, you don't
even capitalize, what's wrong with you?
aghast, I

Wen-chi song is already old news, nomads pass by, decathect texts, that
was yesterday, was this morning, that was this afternoon, that was last
week

this death of mine slows to a crawl, almost stops, did I write that, did I
read this, did I remember to send that, did I remember to receive this

to remember to receive, not to be there, not ready, but to receive upon or 
within the memory, always the future anterior, always as if about to be 
corroded

untraceable

it's decathected, disinvested, the knots are loosened, strings unravelled, 
silkworms gather up cocoons, roll back to chrysalis, ready to receive

to receive the old news brought by the nomads

antennas receiving the news of my not so recent death
