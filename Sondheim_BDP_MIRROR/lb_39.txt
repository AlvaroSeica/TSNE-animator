the adventure


i walk the narrow defile with the valley to the right
the valley to the east, the valley to the south
enter the forest and there is the valley
it's the writing which comes and begs to be understood
the writing comes begging, asks you to keep it
oh keep it fondly this writing, kick it where it belongs
hurt this writing until it cries, give it a read now and then
it doesn't matter much what happens to it
as long as i believe it will be there and tended lovingly
and for now, and just what you might think forever would be
promise me anything, i won't hold you to it
i'll be gone, nothing more to be said, you can pretend, can't you
there's a stream gone down the valley, down into a slit
beyond, there's always beyond, dry bones of the valley floor
you can find a grating there, open it with your key
crawl along, look for the manuscripts stacking the walls
if you play adventure, you'll know what i mean
read them, they're mine, each and every one
they're precious as the daylight in this dim world
you can pretend you're reading at the very least
you'll find someone throwing a knife at you, DON'T THINK ABOUT ME
turn around quickly, back out of that place, your wits intact
there are others
