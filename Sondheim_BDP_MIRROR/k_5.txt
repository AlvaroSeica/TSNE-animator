The footnote offers the possibility of detachment, tethering; it also con-
structs the illusion of mirroring the text from a distance. It is necess-
ary for the subject, which is already divided, coagulated, resisting fur-
ther pulls upon the body. It gathers at the bottom of the text, appears to
trail off, whispering a continuous conversation limited by the wavering
interest of the author. Or, categorically, she believes that everything 
is pinned down, placed within the relic of taxonomy at this juncture 
which is the border of the text, border of the body, liminal space among 
the purity of the reader and her flow, and whole worlds of legitimation, 
articulations of the real through the activity of speech alone.

The subject always already appears above the line, but the footnote is 
neither scaffold nor matrix, but vector. It reduces the body, turns away, 
effaces, recuperates. It is the site of the body as well (paradoxically), 
harboring otherwise censored material. But don't look for the unconscious 
here: everything is revealed, and the footnote is the sign of that revel- 
ation.
