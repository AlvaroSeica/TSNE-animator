Beyond Baroque Reading


(Reading at Beyond Baroque) I realized how much Jennifer and Julu and
Nikuko are inside of me; I read the poems more than the structures,
listening to the sound of the breathing out against the microphone and
audience in absolute blackness; it was as if there were a void, space of
projection - the words went in/through that - Tyler Stallings read about
family and astronaut and abject - again into that space - which was
populated. Then that my work depends on the chant or trance state - even
in cyberspace, that the repetition sounds slightly different, resonant,
with each go - as if I'm inflating a body _out there_ - _within me_ - both
interpenetrated - inflating into the gesture of a caress, that body and my
own, the two of us, many of us among each other, in that empty space, slow
dancing in that empty space, slow turning and no gravity - we're one, I'm
becoming-Jennifer, becoming-Julu ...

so breathing out the words, mainly of Jennifer-Julu, listening to Julu and
Jennifer within me, growing breasts, holes, smoothed skin across galaxies
and wires and nodes, all the invocation of the breath ...

if you are lucky, I will _make you too_ and you will be real, and real for
me ...
