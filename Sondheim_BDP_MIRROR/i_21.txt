Representations of the chora:



What could possibly be the advantage of an image of the chora, which is

of course unrepresentable, so that even the concept turns in upon itself

as if in the form of denial? This of course after Plato, where "recep-

tacle" and nurture play a role.



Clearly the chora is fractured, hollowed, multiple, filled and fulfilled

with virtual collisions, virtual collusions.



Not so clearly it possesses illusory and problematic depths. Within, the

dawn of the night of signifiers, broken edges of graphemes - within and

without, a certain uncertain distribution of the poetic.



Clearly there are partial inscrptions, the uncanny beginnings of the 

proper name, colorless, this matter of intensities.



Clearly these intensities beginning their emergence as things and objects

of the world, a certain uncertain darkness at noon.



Not so clearly, this space which flattens, increases in depth, pulsates,

in response to the position, site of the viewer's sight, who refuses to

cite, who has released hirself to cite.



So I imagine a sheet, taut, almost to the breaking point, nonetheless

curved, stretched from horizon to horizon, edges and edge-phenomena close

to invisible, laminar, or not quite.



Which is never possible on a terminal screen, but only as an extrapolation

which is also clearly self-defeating. Nonetheless...

and there are others as well, extensions/intensions, still in process of

development which... are not quite suitable for public access... as the

chora remains... within a certain darkness or interpolation of the sym- 

bolic... crushed, what might be a form of intension.
