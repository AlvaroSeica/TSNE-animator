As in Klossowski's Baphomet, the symbolic breath construes and splin-

ters the body which is never in evidence. We have spoken of the

_uncanny_. My work lies in the _muck_ of the world, that aspect of 

abjection which refuses cleansing. I worship SATIN, dream of her

nightly. Alas, she thinks of me as well, her fingers numbed on the

keyboard, subscriptions coming in now by the tens of thousands. The

world awaits a new beginning, focus on dramatic splendor, sightless

dream harbinger of jumpstart machinery. SATIN smiles and her smile

lights the world. SATIN smiles for me.
