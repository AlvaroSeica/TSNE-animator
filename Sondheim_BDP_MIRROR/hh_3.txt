Alan, running Jennifer


[running.jpg on Cybermind, also known as a5.jpg, also known as .aa5.jpg.]

Alan, running Jennifer, turning hir out, _lathing._ Were it not for the
lathe, Jen would have been lost. To transform. One good turn formed for an
other. To have been transformed. To have been heated:

Net and nightclub both depend on performative illumination. You see what
Jen wants you to see; with Jen, it's _lit,_ artificial, what turns hir on,
turns on. Because everything is construct, light is an outgrowth, byprod-
uct of pixel values. 

Jen burns; s/he's defined by hir burning, skin caressed by violent light.
What remains in darkness doesn't exist; s/he keeps hirself backgrounded,
always beneath you. Jen, Jen, Jen.

This is the sickness at the end of the millennium, between virtual and
real, wars flamed across violated spaces, bodies buried without wounds,
brands, corpses, missing limbs. This is the sickness of the phantom body,
displaced from hand or foot: everything, everything...

Alan sits at the terminal, runs Jen; Jen's turned out; it turns out Alan
is turned-out Jen. Or Jen sits; there's always pictures and pictures,
Jen's trip through the wires, not yet complete, just a day or two ago.
What passes for days. What turns out to be cold-cycles.

Jen wonders at hir heated body. Jen wonders where the heat comes from.
