Finally, to speak of _making good citizens of us all_ - it's becoming
clearer than ever that we're moving towards a totally transparent society
in the United States, one of perfect voyeurism/exhibitionism, in which
every event and transaction of every citizen will become available to
every other - at least those with the savvy to hack or access the data-
bases. On the Net, cookies work wonders; when you're logged in on the Web,
you're increasingly part of everyone else, data-accessible. When and if
teledildonics become the order of the day, your body, too, will be avail-
able, at least in the latest cyborg version. Beware or embrace; in the
meantime, my loft is increasingly invaded by computer phonecalls, tele-
marketing, junk mail; my email account is increasingly spammed - the holes
in my body are Inboxes/Outboxes - and we better move beyond the cyborg
paradigm fast to take into account this invasion by unruly capital...
