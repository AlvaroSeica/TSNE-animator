	PRELIMINARY USER'S GUIDE TO THE ARPA NETWORK


1   	_Overview_

The socket connection is viewed as a device and setting up a connection is
analogous to mounting a disk pack or, in the 10/50 system, to assigning a
logical name to a device. The user establishes a connection (via the UUO
given below) and performs normal I/O, including file manipulations (initi-
ally not implemented). The connection is permanent for the life of the
user's job (unless it is explicitely closed). The user interface to the
network is a pseudo-device labelled an "IMP". Each IMP is capable of a
transmit and/or a receive socket connection. The IMP has been constructed
to resemble as much as possible the device types on the PDP-10 timesharing
system. Thus existing programs can be expected to work over the network.

2A 	NCP Interface

2A1	The user interfaces with the NCP via a single UUO. The calling se-
	quence is:

	MOVE AC,[ (<FLAGS>B8) + <CODE> ,, E]
	CALLI AC,-5   OR CALL AC,[SIXBIT -IMPUUO-]
	  ERROR RETURN...	ERROR CODE PLACED IN E+1
 	OK RETURN...		FUNCTION COMPLETED

		...

	E:	SIXBIT /NAME/	;DEVICE LOGICAL NAME
		O		;RETURN ARGUMENTS
		<SOCKET>	;LOCAL (8 BIT) SOCKET NUMBER
		<STATE>,,<HOST> ;INITIAL STATE(BYTE SIZE,
				;   ETC.), REMOTE HOST
		<REMOTE SOCKET> ;REMOTE(32 BIT) SOCKET

2A2	Operation

Upon execution of the IMPUUO, the exec first identifies the requested
function and verifies that the user is privileged to use the facility. The
device identified in location E is then found and assigned by console to
the user. If the device cannot be found and the function is of the
connection type, then a free IMP is given to the user. If the specified
name is null or "IMP", then the physical name of the device (IMP1,  IMP2,
IMP3,  etc.) is written over it. Otherwise, the supplied name is given to
the IMP as a logical name.

The NCP(Network Control Program) is called to generate the proper control
messages and the current socket state (see section 2A5) is updated, as ap-
propriate. If the function is one of those that wait for a reply from the
remote host, the user's job is placed in I/O wait until that reply arrives
or a timeout occurs (timeout occurs) timeout not yet implemented). When
the operation has been completed, the skip return is taken. Whenever an
error is detected, the proper code is deposited in E+1 and the non-skip
return is taken.

2A3 Function Codes

The function codes are not yet fixed and are subject to immediate altera-
tion. The current set is:
0	Return the status of transmit socket in left half of E+1 and the
	receive socket in the right half of E+1. See 2A5 for an explana-
	tion of the state codes.
1	Start making the connection specified.
2	Start closing the connection specified.
3	Same as (1), but wait for completion.
4	Same as (2), but wait for completion.
5 	Listen for external requests for connection.
6 	Flush all requests.
7	Get the next external request.
8	Accept the latest request.
9	Reject the latest request.
10	Connect the user's teletype to the specified socket pair. Both	
	must be open.
11	Specify a translation code. (unimplemented)
12	Send an interrupt on link.
13	Trap to specified address on receipt of an interrupt on link. 
	Address is in E+!.
14	Return the version numbers of the IMP service and the NCP in the
	left and right halves of E+1, respectively.

64	Send a "RST"
65	Send an "ALL". Arguments in E+1 and E+5.
66	Send a "GVB".
67	Send a "RET".
68	Send an "ECO".
69	Send an "ERP".

2A4	Error Codes

	When the non-skip return is taken, an error code is deposited in
	E+1 as follows:

0	The function is not available (illegal or not implemented).
1	There is no such device (IMPn with n too big).
2	The device is not available.
3	The device is not an IMP.
4	The socket must be closed for this operation.
5	System error -- socket wouldn't open.
6	Socket must be open for this operation.
7	System error -- socket wouldn't close.
8	Socket must be listening for this operation.

2A5 Socket States
0	S.CLOS	Closed
1	S.LSTN	Socket is listening for incoming requests.
2	S.RFCN	An RFC has arrived on a listening socket
3	S.ABRT  A CLS was received for a socket in S.RFCN state.
			(aborted request)
4	S.RFCW 	A RFC was sent. An answer is expected.
5	S.OPEN	Open for data transfer.
6	S.CLSW	A CLS was sent. A reply is expected.
7	S.RFMW	Waiting for a RFNM before issuing a CLS.
8	S.CLRC	Awaiting a CLS for the logger
9	S.RMLW	Awaiting a RFNM for the logger.
