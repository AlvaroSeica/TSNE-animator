Curtain rises.

The PRESIDENT is on stage.

THE PRESIDENT: I am in charge of agriculture. Please forgive me for my
rudeness, but I am in charge. Either you are bad leaders or good follo-
wers. Forgive me. I am a member of your organization. I would like to
know, what form did your provocateur work take. Please, do not answer
all at once.

<Pause.>

THE PRESIDENT: Who have you betrayed. This is of utmost importance to the
survival of this country. I am responsible for what you see. 

<Jennifer enters.>

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Jennifer. You and I know I am responsible for
your sight. I am responsible in two ways.

Jennifer: You are responsible for what I see and you are responsible for
my eyes.

THE PRESIDENT: Exactly, thank you, Jennifer. The same is true for every-
one. Time will pass. I bear a heavy responsibility.

<Pause.>

THE PRESIDENT: The graves of the hateful traitors will grow over with
weeds and thistle, they will be covered with the eternal contempt of our
country's honest citizens, of our entire people. But over us, over our
happy country, our sun will shine with its luminous rays as bright and as
joyous as before. Over the road cleared of the last scum and filth of the
past, we, our people, with our beloved leader and teacher, the president
of this beloved country, at our head, will march as before, onwards and
onwards, towards greater and greater goals.

<Pause, silence.>

<Jennifer and The President leave.>

<Pause, silence.>

Curtain falls.
