1 i tell stories, parables, awake! awake!



2 you want us disemboweled. you want your clothes back on. you want the

political economy of the superstructure. the superstructure saves you. it

is your tombstone and your procreation.



3 you hang in the wires with me. i grab your panties. you're my girl.  

you'll always be my girl.



4 that's the reason. the wires save us. they're the names of everything

we constitute. we're saved by them. animals have no names. they can't

call. they can't call up.



5 this is the story. i was born furious. i have to undo my own

creation. my name is flesh-girl-god. everyone knows the decay of language.

i speak and repeat myself. i'm obsessive-compulsive. the disorder keeps

the world alive. repetition keeps the world alive.



6 there are wires in my mouth, blood in my hole. everything carries

the code of life. wires burn scars.



7 the scars are circles in my cunt. herpes expands across the body.

everything moves outward. it hides out in nerves, in culture. culture is

the disease that marks the body. look, you can see me there. look, you can

touch me there.



8 i am frightened of everything. the wires expand and burn against

my tongue. they form the character for interval. they form the character

for annihilation. for emptiness. for perfect-flaw.



9 because i will kill you and fuck your brains out.
