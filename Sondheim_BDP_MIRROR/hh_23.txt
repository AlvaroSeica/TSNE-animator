Jennifer's tired, Jennifer's gift


these are yours - images, lines, stains of blood and font upon the page
- yours the quality of swollen life - and those mine - the litany of
words spitting out empty air, exhausted, sounding hollow within you -
never dragging, never one another down -

"Alan" which falls apart                  "Jennifer" which falls apart

capital, the capitals, auracular language stuttering* coagulation which
centers _it_ ( name clattering in the void )

*spitting, spattering, sputtering, smattering: s#@ttering

I want it to be _thus_ so close, mingling of blood and breath, impene-
trable wryting, hieroglyph of the delineated body, as in _this text_ and
no other (smell of womb, this sun, sunlight, this space upon the screen,
this silence, flesh and font)


Jennifer's _feeds nowhere_

essence falls like a thud.
tired arguments of essence.
logic cuts. you call it a knife.
logic feeds nowhere, leads.

clumsily standing on feet
I'm stabbed with your pen
wielded through eye cut
blind, you miss, I can't see depth.
(cut blind you; blind you you miss)

don't chatter with me, I'm down
in your cracked picture, where
(your cracked terminal, your
terminal regard, I'm down, I'm done)
down, there's earth and water.
my voice rises, thud.
