the snow

all two crystals are alike. this is a substance which absorbs boundaries 
with useless delineations. its purpose lies in disappearance. 

jennifer makes snow angels just as angels make jennifer.

it occupies and beseeches without asking. response is required but it
requires no response.

the inuit have one word for snow. there is one snow.

this is the snow.
