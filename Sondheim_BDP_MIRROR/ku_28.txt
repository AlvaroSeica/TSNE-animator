Nikuko, Swollen Worlds, Revolving


trAce

This room has wooden floors and a high vaulted ceiling; there is low
furniture scattered about. Computers sit in comfortable alcoves; they're
networked, with the capability of interweaving screens. One windows looks
out over an amazing desert with Saguaro and Cardon cacti; a second looks
over a landscape of sky-scrapers; a third, over forests and meadows
receding into the distance; and the fourth, over a stormy ocean. The waves
from the ocean lap at the forests and meadows; leaves and pollen fall into
the concrete canyons; the sounds of traffic are heard in the desert; and
the desert descends to the sea.

Dark times are here again. Landscapes slip past vistas and windows
You say: Dark times are here again. Landscapes slip past vistas and
windows open nowhere, as if there were panoramas circulating among
inscriptions.

space and exhibitionists, peerages and petticoats, these are serious
You say: space and exhibitionists, peerages and petticoats, these are

It says nothing. The sea leads to the cities in the forests above the
desert.

Nikuko says: Fragile lines mark the splitting of eggs as births are given
their due. Use them for the future: read an omen which collapses into the
fold of an energy-page. The panoramas continue to move past the windows.

.look

The panoramas continue to move past the windows. Are they diorama, that
cylinder surrounding your daily life? Mobile without end, connected as
multiple topologies? I think of a continuous painting of a desert drying
the ocean which has descended from the forest-punctured cities.

Everywhere I look, I see Jennifer. I am in love with Jennifer. Jennifer
has painted me in.

Nikuko is my mother. Flesh-Girl, Meat-Girl, I am reading my egg.
