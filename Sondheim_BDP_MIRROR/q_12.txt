Silence as Stabilization


Ludwig Wittgenstein, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, the infamous #7:

Wovon man nicht sprechen kann, darueber muss man schweigen.

Translations Ogden, Pears/McGuinness 1/2

Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.
What we cannot speak about we must consign to silence.
What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence.

The _first version_ assigns a spaital domain (wo/hier) to the silence, but
a domain which seemingly is also effaced; there's a hint of privacy at
work. The _second_ is a slightly more corporate model with a hint of cont-
radiction at work, since consignment is also an inscription or speech act
itself. The _third_ lends itself to the angelic, (ueber), a flight above; 
there is a hint of Rilke at work. All this work!

All this noise!
