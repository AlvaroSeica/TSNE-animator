		      there's rain on the ground
			 and rain in my heart
		      and i know that i've read
			these lines about rain
		       that you wrote in a book
		       that i read in my heart
			when i went a-walking
		       in the cold winter rain
			when i went a-singing
			 when i made the rain
			when i made the ground
			when i made your heart
			 when i made the book
			when i went a-walking
		       in the rain that i made
			when i went a-singing
		      in the rain on the ground
