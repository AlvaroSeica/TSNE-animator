8. deconstruction of 'purity' of structure. This goes literally without 
saying, a deconstruction through the presencing of noise: look at the 
dialogic/dialectic: between noise and structure, abjection and purity, 
flesh and sounding, metaphor and explanation - all occurring within time, 
within the real-time of improvisation. So improvisation unravels what it 
ravels; in another century, this might have been called the pursuit of 
life itself. (And deconstruction of edge-phenomena: what occurs as 
diacritical or 'curlicue,' peripheral, as well.)
