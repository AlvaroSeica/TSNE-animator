Serious Little Story by Jennifer


All of human history can be summed up: seize the symbol - inscribe!
Language did us in with its future tense. 

It was language, not us. It was language that led the arm to pick up the
axe - or rather the axe was already a symbol, that is a type or token.

If the axe is in ten minutes, death isn't far away. Between death and the
body there is the axe.

Between death and the axe, there is the axe.

Superstructure arises; cut off, sociobiology takes a holiday.

Exchange sets in; not everyone is so lucky. 

The axe brings death closer, wards death farther. (This is what elsewhere
I have called the 'economic trajectory.') It is stone, still earthbound.

Middens ravage the land; later, tels.

Language describes all of this; like capital (nothing more than exchange
of exchange), it seeps.

Like a balloon, bite into byte. Tense is forgotten; words perform, clean,
live forever. 

No longer, noise, decay. What is replaced, grows upon it. Earth groans;
language is elsewhere.

The history of being human is afterthought.
