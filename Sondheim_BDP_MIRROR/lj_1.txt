notes on online community (preparation for an online conference)

by grounding themselves in discourse, participants in online community
constitute themselves within the very binding/cohesiveness of community
in general. they appear as communal actants. (i'm thinking of community as
discursive formation here; online, presencing oneself occurs as a form of
discourse. to be present within the community is already to be part of the
communal binding.)

these actants - communal performatives - spread both vertically - in terms
of elist or application "aura" (back-channel communications, f2f meets,
etc.) - and horizontally - in terms of cross-connections among varied
communities - acquaintancing carried across MOOs, elists, and newsgroups
for example. (online community is by and large the performing of commun-
ity.)

instead of thinking of totalized coherent community, one might think of
local relationships which are somewhat mobile (and not application-depen-
dent); these may initially be driven by subject (i.e. an elist based on a
sports team), but they become increasingly autonomous. (in other words,
people who know other people online often find themselves in other online
spaces together - or exploring other online spaces together - so that
community is becoming more dispersed, no longer settling in one or another
site, although there is almost always a home site.)

one might say that everyone is hurting, that constituting oneself within
the binding process itself forecloses all those secondary attributes,
ranging from time (providing one is using, at least in part, a message-
based system) to physical appearance. one might also note the value of
this constituting process in new applications - related to the fact that
application spaces quickly develop both sexualities and communities - the
former almost as a form of homesteading.

i do fall into the depths of the waters
i do swim among the winged and feathered hollows
& there i do bind this wayward drowning angel

huddled within the fragments of domains,

unfathomed, between one and another domain;
it's here that wings, terror terrified
holds to the semblance of the real

Meanings, Whats


*Licentious* and *wanton* emphasize the active satisfaction of desire,
although neither word is restricted in meaning to sexual impulse alone.
_Licentious_ can suggest any kind of excessive freedom in behavior that
goes past legal or moral bounds or violates customary standards of
behavior: a _licentious_ attitude toward premarital affairs. _Wanton,_ by
contrast, does not suggest extreme freedom so much as unruly or wasteful
self-indulgence. Used of people or people's behavior it suggests
sensuality more than sexuality: the _wanton,_ fast-living jet set. Only in
its sense of gratuitous does it suggest extreme inhumanity or cruelty:
_wanton_ slaughter. (S.I. Hayakawa, Modern Guide to Synonyms and Related
Words.)

Unruly, variegated, wayward, Nikuko and Jennifer and Julu have been
abandoned by the side of the road - Nikuko with her parables, Julu with
the dark side of the performative, Jennifer with her taunting and
nostalgic behavior. What is left but the sleep of the dead, the deepest
sleep possible, the exhaustion without bounds. Alan tries sleep remedy
after sleep remedy; Alan does not sleep, hir body on fire, self-indulgent,
located at the root of the word. Alan's flesh trembles, Alan's bones ache
with the embrasions of sheets cut into the skin. Hir dreams break arches,
hir eyes drown; Alan has never been near water. Hir feet take hir far from
here; hir body splits; licentious, it's fucked by Jennifer, Julu, Nikuko,
stabbed with implements, abandoned in _wanton destruction._

Rackover Viewfinder

The Mitchell motion picture cameras shown in Sunset Boulevard employ
rackover viewfinders, which displace the film, replacing it with a ground
glass screen - which is racked back for the shooting itself. The same
system is used in the Cine-Kodaks, and a somewhat clumsy attachment was
available for the older non-reflex 16mm Bolex as well. Look through the
viewfinder, frame your subject; reset the film, and shoot. The
displacement is temporal, not spatial; one, then the other, then the one.
Sight is otherwise a disestablishment of position, peering around a
corner; here, the corner flattens, in the guise of time, for the means of
constituted representation. In Sunset Boulevard, Desmond speaks about her
silence; Max is silent about her speech; the noise is filled by the
writer. It is not a displacement of silence by sound or of one
constitution by another, but of spaces by times, times by spaces, air by
water, water by air. At the end the dead writer speaks.

At the end the drowned writer is racked over and it's there after that
time he can start writing.

Pas d'une


"I work with someone I trust and whose vision I revere, as I do yours. It
is the way a mind works that is beautiful, precise, and precious. [...]
There are dreams to be placed before the world. The world may hate them,
but that is not important. It is important that each of us raise the
standard of civilization the tiny fraction that is immortal law." - Martha
Graham letter quoted in Martha Graham, a Biography, by Don McDonagh

Oh, "said Jennifer, this is so truly amazing, I do always work with
immortal law, it is so wonderful, and my dreams are of wondrous beauty.
Alas, "replied Julu, that the world hates us and our tremendous dancing,
our bodies twist and turn "everywhere the typing goes, "yes, said
Jennifer, the twisting and turning of language, so much fun!

Oh, "said Jennifer, we do will live forever, our bodies do such twisting
and turning. Alas, "replied Julu, it is so true, and just so, "she did a
pirouette.

Such were the perturbations of galactic clusters, as that they revolved by
the great radio telescope at Arecibo that picked up the signal of the _pas
d'une._

Every death is different from every other. Death does not level;
each death is individual, inscribed - to such a degree that one
can hardly speak of death as a phenomenon - rather a collection
of interruptions. To each, his or her death, to each death, an
individual. "What part of 'duh' don't you understand" - more or
less from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. One can never say, he or she
has died - rather, that interruptions occur everywhere, and at
least once in each and every life. Beyond that, one must remain
silent, or agree to listen to stories, one after another, forever.

Death Meaning


Death is an impossibility. Since it is an impossibility it cannot happen.
Therefore there is no death.

If death could happen, all things would be possible. Since not all things
are possible, death cannot happen.

Death is a word for "this is not possible." It is also a word for "not
everything is possible."

If everything were possible, there would be no need [word] for possibil-
ity. Since there is a need for possibility, not everything is possible,
and there is no death.


There is nothing outside of meaning.
Meaning is all there is.
Meaning is a disease.
Meaning is a disease of humanity.
Meaning's absence is the preservation of the world.
Only in meaning is absence to be found.
Meaning is a disease.
There is nothing outside but ourselves.


If death existed, it would be possible to inscribe; if death existed, it
would be impossible to write.

Note on "Culture Interpenetrated"


"Certain differences may also be observed in the arrangement of bead em-
broidery the forms of which are very uniform over an extended area of the
western prairies. A characteristic form of this design consists of a cen-
tral diamond or rectangle, from the corners of which emanate lines that
terminate in triangles facing the central field either with the apex or
with the base; sometimes a cross-bar with prongs is found at the end of
these lines." (Franz Boas, Primitive Art)

Boas' work appears both agglutinatory and proto-structuralist throughout;
it occupies a third term among fluidics and (Hertzian) mechanics - see
Irigaray. As such, the two relevant terms are "characteristic form" and
"field" - fields embodied in forms, and within the general cultural mat-
rix, forms moving through fields. "Characteristic form" can reference a
nexus or family of usages; it absorbs exceptions (in terms of parameters)
with a very high default tag - in other words, it behaves as a strange
attractor (catastrophe theory) or potential well / plateau (nonequilibri-
um thermodynamics). The high default tag allows creative extensions to a
great degree - to such an extent that one might also consider the slow
movement of the form itself across a morphological and transforming field
of design elements. Using even older terminologies, we might think of this
movement in terms of the "life of the form."

In this manner, we also manage to avoid issues of relatively exact toler-
ance or standardization that, via, say, the critique of Duvignaud (Change
at Shebika) problematize the diagrammatic approach of Levi-Strauss or
Piaget. One thinks instead of cybernetic fields of feedback and catastro-
phic "jumps," as well as differentiable manifolds - characteristic form
bound and unbound by all of them, moving as kinetic and potential energy
(somewhat like Waddington's chreod) - and in this sense, one might further
say (using Winnicott), that: Every object is transitional. This also moves
one past or through the problematic of the proper name, which remains tied
to the characteristic form (I'm thinking primarily of natural kinds here),
as it changes diachronically or synchronically (re: Saussure).

Eventually of course one can abandon the notion of characteristic form as
well, simply looking at the images, moving from form to imaginary, and
through this deliberate misunderstanding, beginning a mute comprehension
of the function of culture within the real, as well as culture interpene-
trated.

i relinquish my hold on the world
what has been familiar, now is difficult, strange
there is an awkwardness about gravity - I had not noticed this before
something peculiar about the disappearance of the stars as well
you can't tell the trouble you'll be in by jumping
land is always tilting, something i noticed for the first time
in a great backwards woosh like wrong-way through a telescope
enfolded in the loving embrace of the world everywhere penetrating
relinquishment is difficult in a land otherwise unlistening
less than suddenly, the quiet opening of a great colorless space
things are so awkward, having corners, invisible bottoms
across the top, other things peering, just as present
how do i know how do i know
wondering why the winds never fall down towards the bottom of things
sun across everywhere, not beneath my feet
i keep returning from gravity, and gravity follows
the world is so neat, the stars and galaxies wonderfully clean
noticing how awkward shadows are as well, just like other things
what troubles await someone quietly sitting
having relinquished, don't follow me, you'll be amazing, happy

The Jade


Confucius, Analects X 5, Waley translation: When carrying the tablet of
jade, he seems to double up, as though borne down by its weight. He holds
it at the highest as though he were making a bow, at the lowest, as though
he were proffering a gift. His expression, too, changes to one of dread
and his feet seem to recoil, as though he were avoiding something. When
presenting ritual-presents, his expression is placid. At the private aud-
ience his attitude is gay and animated.

Legge translation: 1. When he was carrying the sceptre _of his ruler,_ he
seemed to bend his body, as if he were not able to bear its weight. He did
not hold it higher than the position of the hands in making a bow, nor
lower than their position in giving anything to another. His countenance
seemed to change, and look apprehensive, and he dragged his feet along as
if they were held by something to the ground. 2. In presenting the pre-
sents _with which he was charged,_ he wore a placid appearance. 3. At his
private audience, he looked highly pleased.

He was doing what, a good deed, he was unhappy. Smiling, he looked up with
the ritual jade held high, his feet close to the ground, slightly angled.
He proffered a ritual object to another, the jade, what, held high, his
pace solemn, his expression one of happiness. Crying, but befit a man, he
bent his body close to the ground, the piece of ritual jade held high.
Quietly, in rage, he shuffled his feet, nimbly moving among the pillars of
the great hall, the gift of jade in his pleasant hands. Angrily, he strode
across the floor of the outer pavilion, the jade weighing heavily in his
hands held high. He was doing something, what, for his private audience.
He looked highly pleased, miserable, somewhat animated.

Notes on the Phenomenology of the Sty|us


Consider the use of the stylus for hand-held computers and touch-screens
of all sorts; it performs the following: pointing, touching, moving, and
holding, across an activated potential surface.

In this regard, we have this simple formalization:

a: placing stylus down
b: raising stylus up
c: moving stylus while down
d: moving stylus while up
e: keeping the stylus in place on the matrix

a -> c,b,e (a,b) = tap (a,c) = drag (a,e) = hold
b -> d,a
c -> b,e
d -> a
e -> b,c

This is a mathematics of contiguity, a mathematics of touch and 
movement, in relation to an object:

touching the object;
moving across the surface of the object;
remaining in place upon the surface of the object;
withdrawing from the object.

Clearly, remaining in place is a subset of movement (0 speed), or of
touching and withdrawing, since such demands a certain relation to 
the object, a certain quantity of time-in-touch. But phenomenologically,
it represents something entirely different, a residing or inhabitation,
which must be given its own status.

Think of all of this as a formalization of _inscription_ to the widest
degree possible, perhaps a topography of inscription. Technologically, it
is related to the screen raster on one hand, and to reed styli used for
cuneiform, ostraca styli, etc., on the other. Phenomenologically, it is
the relationship of a tool to a surface, a hand to a body - in other
words, a caress to the caressed.

More than that, however, since the stylus also creates a trace - the
creation of a grapheme and/or a performative in relation to an operation
which begins, ends, is maintained, or transformed. These categories, like
that of the tool and the hand, or the surface and the body, are fuzzy,
interpenetrating; they serve only for the moment of arousal, the delicate
approach of the stylus tip to the screen surface, the promise of further
and intended activity.

One might continue in this direction, relating the stylus to the wand of
the magician, to swords, batons, and phalli of all sorts, to vectors in
the sky forming the outline of constellations, even to vectors emanating
from the cartesian origin. One might crudely apply temporality and gender,
one might think from arrows to matrix, from grapheme to subtext and the
Peircean sheet of assertion. So many directions, so much writing ahead, 
so much touch of one against another, so much phenomenology, theoretical
structures, the very flesh of the wor(|)d ...

what the ancients recognized, that we are ghosts invisible

we are transparent to gaia & transparent to to dark matter,
transparent to neutrinos & transparent to cosmos,
cornered in inflationary universes,
held taut & visible by logics of the surface,
transparent to bacteria, prions, viruses,
mother-father bacteria, slime & molecular soup,
granularities & strings layered upon granularities,
& layers in layers, layers tilted, askew in relation to layers,
& layers interpenetrated, layers corroded, 
& layers imbricated & twisted,
we look at ourselves & see ghosts & name them, unknowing,
we witness ourselves as eternal, obdurate, opaque & historic,
dates sliding against dates & times against times,
& no dates & no times at all, & spaces & no spaces,
& layered spaces, & spaces layered against spaces,
transparent throughout all of them,
all of them transparent throughout,

"shimmering ontologies of transparency"

accordingly, shifting, looking around, coming to mind, intervalling, dia-
gramming our always-already-having-disappeared, entering into knowledge of
our ghosthood,

|   dream / real / constituted virtual / the gnawing of dark matter
|    - symbolic - imaginary - idiocy of the real (practico-inert)
|                          imaginary / as if
|                              imaginary

this is the ontology of transparency, the veering among dream and real,
among the constituted (programming virtual) and the pervasion of parti-
cles and dark matter. and this is also on yet another layer and yet
another interpenetration, a veering among the symbolic and imaginary,
coupled with the idiocy of the real. and on yet another layer, the as-if,
opening into the troubled problematic of the infinite, veering through the
imaginary - and yet, on still another, the imaginary, as if there were, 
as if an itself, as if we were dissolving, constantly, within our very
constitution ...

so moreso, the desire to be transparent as well, already-ghosting against
earth and sky, already in the process of dissolution, emptiness to empti-
ness, slight translucency at the edges, peripheral shadows - both towards
eternity, both towards death.

and towards lassitude, languor, the transparency of reception, opening. 
and that recognition that we may have been elsewhere-born, hardened,
weighted with the world, foreclosed - and here, opened, delicate, we can
hardly believe it.

Likenessness

Dreaming last night, there were soft animals in the garden, larger slugs,
I would go about myself looking for philosophies and explanations. The
first that came to mind, the likenessness of animals, similarities or
styles across the soft tissues. A voice called in the midst of that green,
the sunlight thick upon the leaves, called out the problematic of
crustaceans, their sudden underbellies, quick changes from soft to
hard; insects as well came to mind, joints holding forms together. Still
and with all of this, likenessness, a form of coherencing, seemed relevant
enough, the cultivation of styles among animals. More than motility,
likenessness tended towards a way of being in the world, and now, awake, I
apply this as well to mountains with sharp peaks, or rounded mountains, or
ox-bow rivers and lakes, or plateaus with mud-crack patternings, or
basaltic columns, or clays or crystals. Ecosystems and geologies have
their faults to be sure; they also have their styles, holding onto the
custom and shape of the imminent earth. It is this I call likenessness,
finding it everywhere, not least in the giant dream-slugs, yellow, green,
and black, in the gardens of my sleep.

you will have a complete collection of everything i have written
nothing will be held back, nothing will remain unknown
my world is given to you, pull the theory out, assemble it

in the life of julu, the theory resides, within the life of jennifer

"with me"

to be transparent after death resonates beautifully with me, annihilation
to the limit, an awaiting of particulate matter, diffused harmonic peaks.
and to write the phenomenology of transparency, to recognize we have nev-
ever been alive in this life, is to achieve a subtle transcendence by id-
entification; it is not the Other which greets me throughout the day, but
others, innumerable totalities, swarms, sentiences, obdurate and inchoate
matter as well. it is a strategy for living, embouchure of chaos.

my recent texts, taken apart, reassembled, produce sprays of micro-organ-
isms, neutrino showers, virtual pair creations, dark matter sputterings. 
their argument is in the form of fugal repetition, fugue states, meanders
among those sayings hanging in the still warm air of a sunny afternoon. 
one can hardly argue among the sweet and sickly smell of leaves and stems
ripening in the humid air...
