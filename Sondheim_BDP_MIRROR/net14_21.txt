        For Julia



        "Many men sayn that in sweueninges

        Ther nys but fables and lesynges;

        But men may have some sweuen sene

        Whiche hardely that false ne bene"



        the time of others grows so short,

        Kristeva ages far beyond the heart

        or its appearance, once in a great while

        I am enveloped by her smile, and its ranges

        rung in by small changes - 

        nor does the homage-image surmount lineage



        "Her necke was of good fassyon

        In length and gretnesse, by reson,

        Without bleyne, scabbe, or royne;

        For Hierusalem vnto Burgoyne

        There nys a fayrer necke, iwys,

        To fele howe smoothe and softe it is.

        Her throte, also white of hewe

        As snowe on braunche snowed newe."

        (The Romaunt of the Rose)
