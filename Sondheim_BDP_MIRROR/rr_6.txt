My response is at the end of this post

Dear [ ], Alan Sondheim suggested I write to you regarding a piece I am 
preparing for an upcoming exhibition. We have been exchanging emails about 
this idea and he has graciously provided me with his take on the subject. 
I am taking all of the responses and recording them as an ongoing loop 
that will be played in the gallery. I am using a special audiospot light, 
a directional speaker that allows me to focus the playback of the 
recording within a very narrow field so that the visitors to the gallery 
hear the loop as they enter the gallery but if they move out of the field, 
they no longer hear the loop.  An interesting aspect of this type of 
narrow field sound is that the playback is heard in your head in the same 
manner as how headphones work. If you are interested please respond to the
