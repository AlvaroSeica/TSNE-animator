Short prolegomenon to philosophy ii


Others have demonstrated the absurdity of mathematical or physical model- 
ing in philosophical or psychoanalytical discourse. If issues of capital 
are on one side, and fundamental cosmological structure on the other, I 
side with the latter. Hence the issue of parallel transport of a vector, 
"borrowed" from general relativity theory, is problematic; what I need to 
do here is translate this into a series of autonomous semiotic operations 
that cover the same ground; these operations may be considered operators 
in the sense that a discourse or sememe might be subject to them. 

I began with the idea of constructing a closed curve on a surface; I now 
transform this into an _inscription_ in the classical sense, which, as a 
phrase or sentence for example, inheres within a fuzzy domain of discourse 
- in other words, the inscription _translates_ one way or another - it is 
a discursive moment among many - it has no particular bounds, but it has a 
subject, or rather it "subjects" for different subjects, it behaves as a 
fuzzy operator. Thus every inscription is _dynamic._ Now consider a 
circumscription of a particular inscription; this does not mean that an 
inscription is a member of its circumscription in the sense of a set, but 
that, for some grouping within some socius, the circumscription carries an 
inscription with it. Inscription: "This sentence is a tree." Circumscrip- 
tion: "I consider the inscription 'This sentence is a tree.'" Again, 
circumscription: "We consider, for the purposes of analysis, whether 'This 
sentence is a tree.' can adequately represent the potential of a sentence 
referencing, not a mathematical tree (where it might apply to grammar for 
example), but a physical tree, an oak for example." 

So a circumscription in this sense is a reinscription of, pointer towards, 
or objectification of, an inscription: it is a mentioning which is also an 
operator. Oh there are so many loopholes here! Close them up!

Now consider the space of the semantic domain, discursive domain, sememe, 
within which this is an occurrence. What does it mean to create a closed 
curve in relation to circumscription?

Well, one way, you might think about an analysis which seems complete - an 
analysis as a space-time event, from which one proceeds. In this sense, 
the analysis is constructed as a temporary totality in memory, that is, 
within the discursive enunciation and phenomenology of the subject, who 
proceeds from this. 

All of this is construed to some extent as a rough guide to cause and 
effect, classical domains, limitations, vectors, enumerations of relation- 
ships, organizational structures (Knuth for example after example). By 
classical domain, I mean the closure that occur in the distributive laws 
of Aristotelian logics; I imagine even Bohm's implicate order follows 
through here. 

So that I can think of inscriptions, circumscriptions, and analyses, all 
as dynamic objects with porous and fuzzy boundaries, with a "sense" of 
closure, which lends itself to phenomenological psychoanalytical analyses 
"beyond" in the sense that the Lacanian objet petit a is "beyond." Let us 
assume that there are namings, meanings, intentionalities, and semiologies 
within consciousness that open even for Husserl, reams of text and the 
appearance of _something being done._

The closures are twisted, which means, here, that moving through an analy- 
sis or circumscription always arrives _somewhere else_ that is inherently 
at odds with what was perceived to be an origin or originary inscription. 
The sememes or discursive formations themselves are non- Euclidean; they 
are simultaneously vectorized (in the same of trees) and n-dimensioned 
with n > 1, which means there are closed 2-spaces, 3-spaces, and the like, 
of interpretation. These spaces are striated, multiply interconnected, not 
smooth, possessing singularities - a kind of topological foam. So on one 
hand, there is the _appearance_ of closure - on the other - the continuous 
and inherent opening, spewing within and without (in the sense of fractal 
current transports) any region, an conceivable circumscription as well as 
the circumscription of circumscription, and so forth.

So from the beginning to the end of analysis, I return to somewhere else 
with a twist which, in this case, does not permit the recuperation of the 
original inscription. What does this "somewhere else" tell us? For one 
thing, it is here that the play of deconstruction occurs - within the 
foam-like curvature of inscriptive domains, however defined. For another, 
the modeling itself parallels that of the World Wide Web's holarchy, in 
the sense that tangled skeins can never be recuperated, but continue a 
journey which is _impossible to bring to closure, impossible to bring to 
an end,_ no matter how exacting the analysis appears to be. In yet other 
words:

One is always beside oneself, one is never a totality nor a shifter, nor 
that of the other, but always elsewhere, elsewhen; "I is not an Other" but 
always a twisted opening. Look at the periphery - the twist becomes 
visible, and analysis collapses - even continuous Freudian analysis - 
there is never a mark to be found, there is no demarcation. While the 
space of relativity is classical in the sense that it's topologically 
coherent, the space of discursive formations, of enunciation, of the self, 
of analysis and self-analysis, is inconceivably complex: Every analysis, 
every critique is _a priori lost,_ - at the same time tending towards the 
uncanny/fictivity of _an_ originary inscription, _an origin,_ as if the 
word were Word, said anything, made anything at all. 



Short prolegomenon to philosophy iii


In the Zen koan there is a severing and no return; in the Oxherding images 
there is a representation of this. The emerging geodesic is an opening 
elsewhere and elsewhen under erasure and the twist is that evidence 
which continues the duration of the novice until it is recognized that 
what appears to be a setup is no such thing. The analysis is a perception 
of the failure of analysis. In Tantra there is a similar occurrence with 
generation and completion, a severance which is not a severance. Nagar- 
juna's contradictions emphasize this on the plane of a logic which 
nonetheless remains bound to its analysis. Without such, there is Tao one 
does not contend with; Tao follows a geodesic. What is missing in all this 
is the twist per se; the twist carries information, that of the semiotic 
foam, information inherently tangled, but information that is not annihil- 
ated. The physical gravity of space-time is presence as well; it is within 
the fine-tuning of analysis that withdrawal and severance appear obdurate. 
Neither withdrawal nor severance is complete; the twist, diacritical 
curlicue presences itself in analysis or not in analysis. In relativity, 
the twist is measurable, a measure of local curvature; in philosophical 
analysis, it is the objet petit a, the horizon and so forth, which resists 
annihilation, continues the project of being-human. What about the curva- 
ture of space in the Flower Ornament Sutra? There must be some such thing 
for perception to occur; even so the Sutra's insistent and continuous 
exfoliation fills every void, as if one could talk of an energy-momentum 
tensor at work. The geodesic clots, is slowed; perhaps this is the case as 
well in any severance or jump; the ground, what one falls into or through, 
is never as clear as it seems to be. Shades of Hegel's porosity come to 
mind. And what comes to mind and disappears is mind, but always with a 
twist. 

One should be careful about rolling everything up into zero or one; the 
fit is not a fit, harmony not a harmony. In a stringed instrument, tension 
constantly varies, and decisions are reached, when something is in or out 
of tune. The beat frequencies slow, but never reach the zero point; there 
is always a literal twist left over, and on a quantum level the string 
frequency must vary to some noticeable degree. What degree is character- 
ized by both human perception and tuning, and by fundamental constants of 
the universe. One always plays against noise, tuning (a) is never the same 
as tuning (b), but neither is it zero nor one.



Short prolegomenon to philosophy iv and last


Analysis in this context says nothing whatsoever about physical theory, 
its direction or relation to the humanities. It occurs as metaphor, 
indicative of parallel operations within a critical phenomenology, but 
also as an approach, keeping in mind the obdurate, the broken, the 
wayward, and the lack of return; in curved space, a parallel transported 
vector in general does not return to itself, a measure of curvature based 
on dissimilarity. In theory, the object, like the author, continually 
shifts against a foam-like holarchy of inscription and information. The 
twist as kernel continually changes as well; thus interpretation occurs 
within a hermeneutics of stochastic/chaotic flux. Philosophy never ends, 
and one might well be suspicious of fundamental philosophies that reify an 
obdurate positionality from which everything is generated; the holarchic 
entanglement of information on the horizon of a black hole is indecipher- 
able. I think of philosophy always plural, always broken, part-object 
philosophies without end, that advance only to the extent that scientific 
theory tends towards a form of increased knowledge. Philosophies continue 
and constitute an endless dialog in retreat and circumscription, a dialog 
of phenomenologies of being-in-the-worlds, ranging across inscriptive 
fields and domains; every moment of stasis is deconstructed, and every 
moment is superseded. Philosophy does not talk to itself; it talks to and 
of the world, and ought listen: just as narratives are constructs useful 
to make sense out of chaos with a surplus of contrariness and noise, just 
so philosophical groundwork is useful, but undercut by surplus. One small 
advantage of postmodernity was the recognition of the inherency and import 
of undercutting; the "myth of eternal return" is found lacking, as every- 
thing, everywhere, everywhen, twists and is always shattered, always 
other, even if only to an infinitesimal degree. It is only within the 
realm of quantum physics and below that absolutes reign, in the sense that 
quantum numbers and fundamental particles are described by finite sets of 
numbers, wave equations, probabilities, and the like. The combinations 
among anything constructed from these - atoms, molecules, fields, and the 
like - tend towards the foam; by the time one reaches the temporal or 
spatial scales of being-human, it becomes impossible to return to, or
postulate origin. And _this_ is semiotically related to other spaces 
embodying sememes, semiotic domains, and fields of inscription, however 
defined; in short, they don't compute, except dynamically, lost like any 
weather system, losing any philosophy.


(End of short prolegomenon to philosophy.)


"The twist is not a knot, but at least among the humanities, indecipher-
able! Otherwise there would be nothing left for us to do!"


Addendum 


It became clear to me, why wasn't it earlier, that the twist shares a 
relationship with the abject, and with suture it is an almost-closure, 
almost-alignment, that fails by the very nature of the world. The abject - 
indecipherable, entangled - lies at the juncture of organism and analysis. 
A lure, it's impossible to eradicate; it's of the nature of space-time 
itself, for the twist is produced by _any_ circulation. This is, for 
example, the meat underlying the virtual, which on one hand is a canopy, 
and, on the other, is the very constitution of inscription. For we deal 
with an entanglement of inscription, beginning with ourselves, which are 
simultaneously everywhere, and nowhere, and in terms of phenomenology, 
part and parcel of curvature. The "dirty little secret" of the world is 
the world, which analysis flies in the face of, to the extent that 
analysis insists it has any relation to the foundational.

In geometry, parallel transport of a vector is a way of transporting it 
along smooth paths in a manifold. If the path is a closed curve and the 
manifold is also curved, the vector doesn't return to itself. If the 
manifold is curved, it can't be flattened.

At this point the narrative breaks off.

filmmanque

original dance by azure carter modified with video editing software and 
software modification by garrett lynch. it is a film manque, a failed and 
absent film, an exhausted film, a trick film with no trick, a tired and 
stereotyped film, a typical film - but a film which hides a seduction, 
which looks elsewhere just when you think it's looking, just when you 
think you're looking, a film which cajoles the emptiness of the image, 
emptiness of any image, a film which promises, destroys promises, tends 
towards the memory of the destruction of speech, of enunciation, a film 
which is just there, as a project-projection. and thus a film which speaks 
with a tongue, your tongue, uttering those platitudes that constitute the 
film.

these are three pieces we've completed, which contain nudity; they're up 
for two-three days only for obvious reasons, but they're part of the work 
we've done, so we felt you should have a chance to see them. nudity fig- 
ures at times in our work, and it's not unusual, in fact, in experimental 
dance today. the instrument in the first is ukulele. the second is from

nudity in dance -

a\ reveals the totality of bodily movement
b\ reveals the totality of involuntary bodily movement (weight and sway 
of breasts, testicles, penis) = humanimal
c\ catalyst for arousal (dancers' erect nipples, penis - but dancing is 
often too intense for this)
d\ frees the body from clothes/costuming
e\ historically relates the body to everything from dionysian rituals to
weimar performance (anita berber, others)
f\ reveals the boundaries of the body's intrinsic extensions
g\ reveals the history of the body through inscriptions (tattoos, shaved 
pubic hair, scars, cuts, bruises)
h\ reveals the body's totality/vulnerability (aging, illness, spasms)
i\ reveals the vulnerability of the sexual organs
j\ simultaneously exposes and hides the sexual organs as a form of
choreographic inscription
k\ potential audience identification (sharing similar bodies)
l\ uncanny relation to magical operations (parallel structures with 
audience)
m\ to the extent that the audience is affected (aroused, gazing, turning 
aside, and so forth), the audience may move towards self-reflexivity
n\ audience members might internally 'mimic' the dancers' movements (i.e.
their own muscles remembering, tautening, etc.), another form of self- 
reflexivity
o\ creates a problematic 'natural'
p\ implies clothing as 'unnatural' or the use of clothing/costuming to
indicate particular inscriptions - i.e. starting from the body as 
'body-degree-zero'
q\ 'might' seem more 'natural' and less erotic
r\ 'might' tend more towards 'natural' representations of sexuality 
and less towards eroticisms bypassing and deflecting
s\ 'might' reflect on the dancer's sexuality intrinsically and extrin-

on a rainy afternoon, as usual thinking about death and decay,
i talk to azure who's reading lady chatterly's lover for the first
and last time. i ask her about the book; there are no sex scenes
in it or naughty words. it's a pre-trial expurgated copy, it 
turns out, but how is one supposed to know. i'm teaching wednesday

a vaguely structural impulse coupled with ignorance and disbelief.
on wednesday we discuss worker's conditions in early 19th-century

producing this very computer i'm typing on, and what is to be 
done, what ever is to be done. the rain pours down, winds howl,

emptied, emptied surface.

New Music, New Dance

Finally I've come to grips with the cobza, tuning it 3/4 of a half note 
lower, and returning to the tuning in fourths. This makes it easier on the 
fingers - especially for right-hand. I've worked out ways to play the 
strings individually - they're now tuned more or less eee' aa dd ggg so 
the e' is a minor third below the g, which is interestng. It's also 
possible to pluck the ggg strings somewhat individually - this makes for 
very fast arpeggios, slides, etc. Traditionally the instrument's played 
with a pick, often with sweeping motions that make it sound something like 
a washboard; it's used for accompanying violin this way. I've heard a few 
plucked solo pieces; there are maybe 3-4 on the net that don't sound oddly 
clumsy and therefore endearing. At least for myself, a bit of the frustra- 
tion is going away; I'm ecstatic (for me) about the following. The first 
is perhaps the oddest; the second is a tour de forest (for me), and the 
other two build on different techniques. By all (net) accounts, the cobza 
is going out of existence, except for revival groups; it's the crumhorn or 
serpent of stringed instruments. But it's fun to play - the entire top of 
the instrument becomes an odd dancing space for finger-boarding.

The confdance piece is a record of an odd dance my avatar did in Second 
Life while I dutifully prepared for an online component of a conference 
coming up in Australia. I liked the dance so much I kept the recording, 
offering it for your (viewing/listing) pleasure.

Outline, thinking through film, a brief formal/informat analysis


Spatially, there are x and y coordinates for each frame. (Take for example 
the lower-left corner for the origin. Temporally, there is most often a 
constant frame-rate f. Consider frame [z] at time t and frame [z+1] at 
time t+1. Then (t+1) - (t) = T = the time between [z+1] and [z], and 1/T = 
f. For example, [z] = 1 second and [z+1] = 1.01 second. then the differ- 
ence is 1/100 of a second, and the frame-rate is 100 fps.

There are several 'temporal orders' in film:

1. Frames per second of the projected film.

2. The speed the film was recorded at. Generally this the same as the 
frames per second of the projected film, but need not be; there are all 
sorts of instances of overcranking/undercranking in silent film, not to 
mention slomo or fastmo shooting.

3. The speed of the original action. This generally assumes the obdurate 
nature of the real somehow determines a 'natural' speed - for example, the 
time it takes a train to pass, tree branch to fall, and so forth. This 
also assumes there _is_ an original action, and that the original action 
is related to real-world timing and events.

4. The speeds set in editing: a sequence may be rendered at any speeds (by 
'speeds' plural, one take varying rates of speed into account).

In summary, all of these are supple; the speed of film in the projector 
can be creatively altered during projection; the speed of original 
recording can be altered during recording; the original action-subject can 
occur at variable speeds (i.e. a performer might speed up or slow down, 
hirself); and the speed set in editing can vary as well.

Note that we're referencing the relatively simple situation of apparently 
recording real objects and events, one way or another: for example all of 
this applies to animation, rotoscoping, 3d, and so forth.

In terms of individual frames - the internal rectangular _field_: each 
frame possesses (x,y) coordinates; each point may be assigned a color and 
brightness value. One might consider each frame as (f(t), {x,y, {c,b}}); 
define the film as: F = {(f(t), {x,y, {c,b}})] - in other words, the set 
of frames and their 'internals.' (Here c and b, today, are digital/hex.)

In terms of the phenomenology of cinema, and in parallel with Reichenbach, 
consider a notion of 'visidentity,' paralleling genidentity; the latter 
references the identity of a physical particle or assemblage through time 
- in other words, the identity of a world-line. Visidentity then 
references the identity of an assemblage from one frame to another. It is 
within the aegis of visidentity that the supple temporal layering of film 
is presenced; the viewer sees continuity or discontinuity from one frame 
to another. Visidentity is fundamental in viewing a film; one must follow 
the apparent appearance of identical objects from one frame to another.

Visidentical objects, for literally all practical purposes, possess their 
own trajectories, their own apparent physics. The appearance of a bat 
appears to hit the appearance of a ball, and the appearance of the ball 
appears to recoil from the appearance of the bat, appearing to fly in what 
appears to be a trajectory cohering to the appearance of common, ordinary, 
physics, in the real world. (Given the digital nature of cinema today, 
'appearance' here is tripled in terms of verisimilitude - for none of this 
need occur at all. So the primary appearing is that of the projection of 
light and darkness, the secondary appearing is that of visidentity, and 
the tertiary appearing is that of an original, and (potentially) digital 
construct.)

In terms of the phenomenology of viewing, it is clear that the simulacrum 
of motion in film is not the result of a 'persistence of vision,' but in 
fact stems from the ordinary viewing of motion in the real world, which 
has everything to do with the continuous 'jump-cut' saccadic movement of 
the eyes, and the like. Thus visidentity in the real world is 'usually' 
identified with genidentity, and in ordinary narrative film, visidentity 
implies the projection of genidentity, which is an introjection: the 
actor, actress, object, appears within the preconscious as if real, and 
for the duration of the film, is assumed to be real. This parallels the 
function of symbolic actions in Bharata's Natyasastra, in which image- 
actions on stage project/introject emotions and 'relative truths' within 
the members of an audience literate in the conventions.

Now of course experimental film may cut through any and all of these 
layerings, which are not written in celluloid granite; they reference the 
complexity of cinematic phenomenology, from the obdurate-physical (frames 
per second), to the perceptual-psychological (visidentity). Thus cinema is 
a slice through and among intersecting sememes. One might briefly note 
several orders at work here:

The _digital_ in the gap between frames and the independence of every 
frame from every other (in other words, absence of genidentity). The 
digital also appears in the very fabric of the frame, to the extent that 
the frame possesses a raster and specific digital encodings of color 
values. The digital also appears in the encoding of sound.

The apparent _analogic_ within each frame (to the extent that raster is 
invisible or absent), and the analogic of sound, as digital sound, 
transmitted through speakers, takes on the characteristics of the theater 
or viewing room.

One might thus consider an _analogic smear_ with digital bases, on a 
formal level. On an informal level, there is the analogic of the psycho- 
logy/phenomenology of the cinematic experience, as well as the analogic of 
visidentity, which is, of course, a formal suturing of objects, in terms 
of projection and introjection, within the viewing of the film.

Two other orders, intertwined with the above, are the _immersive_ and the 
_definable._ The definable references formally definable, within given 
tolerances, and temporal absence. This applies even to the temporal 
sequencing of frames, since one might embed [z], [z+1], etc. into a 
three-dimensional space-time manifold; one can examine each frame indep- 
pendently. In this sense, the definable also applies to each frame as an 
independent _object,_ whether projected or not; much formal film analysis 
deconstructs particular scenes, for example, on a frame-by-frame basis.

The _immersive,_ on the other hand, references the embedding of the viewer 
/subject within the experience of watching the film projection; thus the 
immersive is within the aegis of time and the phenomenology of internal 
time-consciousness. Immersion is often a form of abandonment, not to a 
willing suspension of belief, but an (un)willing acquiescence of belief in 
a naturalized motion of visidentified objects within the film. (un)willing 
acquiescence equally references the subject in what might be considered 
hir natural attitude of being-in-the-world; thus the film is within the 
world, part and parcel of the world, a 'natural artifacture' or artifical 
nature. I am not hearkening back to Bazin here, but to the very obdurate 
nature of film, projection, visidentity, and so forth; this nature holds 
even in the most experimental work.

Finally, these categories are rough at best; all they do is point to 
various semantic and physical regimes, and their intertwining, and to the 
extent that they do this, they're applicable to scientific film, video, 
and other recording modes and media to one or another extent.

i'm making bad jokes, can't do anything else being so tired and sick and 
all, i'm recording these five short pieces. so i'm doing that and say well 
there's a video in this, wait and see. so then i edit it all and our silly 
voices kept going and going, it was too much. so what to do. so i took the 
voices out, added a slowed-down or sped-up cobza soundtrack, forget which, 
and there you are, it all fit together. but then i saw it all looked like 
masturbation, foomph foomph foomph, it was no such thing, it was just this 
exercise stuff. well now what. it made for a good video, that's the truth 
of it, so then i thought i didn't want people to get the wrong idea. so i 
thought, maybe i'd add this description, and they'll get it right, that it 
wasn't masturbation at all but just warming up for a practice dancerun 
which to be sure is a warming up for a real dancerun shortly down the 
line. so here it is, have fun with it, it might be a sunny day yet on the 
upswing although it's the middle of the night,

some things on the music borne


i or so


avoidance of noise ,then how to schedule fury
or furious ,how to subtend silence

i don't want this thinking: that this is exploring instrument,
instrumentality ,nor a field ,subtended by fingers or mouth ,no more
than body

but the joist of particle physics ,muons on a sense of virtual
particles on another

(a b) (a, b) (a / b) (a : b) (a | b) (a f(a, b) b)

it is all resonance ,surprising ,metallic overtones ,ringing: i
remember just several sounds slowed into what seemed right even
then

foreign names touched by cultural illiteracy ,materials ,soundings,
emptied virtuosities

stringed, it is stringing ,perfect tautness ,resistance of parallel
field ,tension of endpoint separation ,tension of separation

i do not want to duplicate this ,i do not want to duplicate an other

something informing ,hypnagogic as if you might dream this ,an other
or dream an other this

but not tiring ,tirade ,more of a space of a sounding or what might be
'some of a sound'

of mewling ,howling ,whimpering ,murmuring ,seething ,then this amazing
release

neither to be where you have been nor will have gone there ,here is 
one alone ,playing music ,playing music together

tending the wood ,nylon ,skin ,metal ,plastic ,catgut ,horsehair ,wax,
bamboo ,bone ,or tending the wires

the absence of metaphor ,wires ,no paralleling ,the difficulty
of absence ,no equivalence ,no identity ,just as everything else is,
or remains ,inert

sound of the obdurate ,sound of the inert


ii or so


learning to play these ,evenings or nights' mornings ,but with all 
respect ,coaxing ,no world music ,no world but what ,are we brought,
to

here's an idea ,so i'll do it ,hear what happens ,when new ,then so
it is brought 

always writing in silence ,always playing in silence ,playing silence,
listening silence ,enormous roiling ,slow extinction of the planet,
these last sounds ,instrument making ,them

she got up from the music ,he got down to the music,
he got up from the music ,she got down to the music

you'll be telling me specifically what you want to know,
i'll be telling you specifically what you want to know

allowing myself the courtesy of being-deaf, 
allowing yourself my fingering you ,of being-sound & of mind & body

listing ,yayli tanbur ,ukulele ,cobza ,hasapi ,cura cumbus ,hegelung,
rababa ,electric saz ,valveless chromatic harmonica ,parlor guitar,
classical guitar ,alpine prime zither ,alpine elegy zither ,like the
emptying of names

unknown on my fault ,something else of shameful ,refusing abjection
in the moment when nail and steel ,flesh and wood ,collide

unknown ,everywhere i look ,unknown


iii or so


i'm not giving you what you want ,that is ,an entry into this sound,
some of an anecdote ,or at the very least, an explanation ,as in,
'you owe me an explanation'

i wouldn't know how to begin ,perhaps in eternal sorrow ,mourning,
every minute of the life

or the slightest peaks of joy

or stories about failure quantum-tunneled into music of unutterable
beauty ,or musics

or something about how these instruments came about ,what do i know
of their arrival ,or this i know ,their attraction for me ,sounding
of the world through them

fretless ,they are teaching me how to listen ,place each finger in its
rough exactitude

or fretted in narrowed intervals ,what might be ,for others ,or those
places of others ,a difference in this world

or numbers of worlds ,worlds without number ,over and over again,
desperately listening ,listening ,as if something might come about,
occur ,just by the sheer force of it

or the slow sweep of the bow as left hand fumbles for tone or tune,
begins its slower repetition ,rasa ,the savoring


iv or so


it is more you want ,more you ever want ,this savagery ,this lack
of mine ,of yours ,one more word ,phrase ,sound or tune ,book or text,
of book and of sound ,of tune and of text ,that will do it ,completion,
or suturing ,the fullness of the world ,fecundity, repleteness,
lathering ,or foam of planck mass ,length ,time ,of vacuum and an 
energy ,of particle and fray

this savagery a savagery ,silence a quiescence, calmness ,the piercing

of things ,of some things ,on the music ,on the music borne

"Dance of the Soul's Journey"

by Zourna


The soulless body (1)

Asks for the light of life (2)

Vision dawns (3)

Inexpert in life, she walks gropingly (4)

She draws aside the veil of the future (5)

Life is seen full and plenteous (6)

But old age will come (7)

Grief will visit (8)

She shall walk with her nose close to the camel's foot (9)

Yet now, from the crown of her head (10)

To the souls of her feet she is perfect (11)

Rejoices in the perfect body (12)

And in all good things (13)

Runs from the scene (14)



Arabian "Dance of Mourning"

by Zourna


The body approaches (1)

The body passes (2)

"I hold my sorrow to myself" (3)

"He has gone out of the house and up to Heaven" (4)

"Farewell" (5)

"He slept in my arms" (6)

"The house is empty" (7)

"Woe is in my heart" (8)


(from The Dance, Troy and Margaret West Kinney, 1914)




Spliceroots


Re/mapping of a review-in-progress of Martha Fleming's Split + Splice, 
Del + Hel, show at the medical museum in Copenhagen. Working on this 
and at the same time, looking for the bone of the apparatus, which is
the applicable language, what I write/wryte here. So then for here now 
to modify the root, or to produce the root text, for other emergence,
hence this piece which belongs _here,_ the review coming later.

anguish


anguish exists in the moment or the past of the moment
anguish tears bodies limbs from limbs
anguish haunts the forbidden

anguish opens the forbidden to mockery
anguish transforms mockery into the bone of tragedy

everywhere the bone, the bone, the bone
everywhere hardening and then softening and falling through
everywhere failing

anguish burns the self into the self
it's hardly possible to open ones eyes
it's hardly possible to close them

anguish is the fuel of art
anguish is the collapse of attitude 
and anguish is the collapse of a natural attitude
an attitude in which everything remained alive

if it weren't for anguish our camera would silence itself
our camera would lie in a hidden place and a lost place
our camera would dissolve the economy of the world

anguish opens the body to anguish
anguish closes the body to an opening in the world
an opening in the world is always small
our camera misses it and misses our body

our camera cries so hard because it misses our body

triggers -


thoughts of death and annihilation
-- when i can't get dying out of my mind
-- when i find annihilation intolerable
-- when i'm living through my death and annihilation

thoughts of events immediately after my death
-- when i think of azure seeing, something, anything, immediately
after my death
-- when i think of my loved belongings, dispersed, on unknown journeys
-- when i think of the matrix of my life dissolving
-- when i can't express this to others

remembering my father's behavior towards me
-- when i think of growing up in a horizon of tempers and screaming
-- when my mother remained aloof or blind to this
-- when i remember crumbling under psychic violence
-- when i can't express this to others
-- when i can't deal with authority, including my own
-- when i deconstruct authority to the point of abjection and
annihilation

my sister's behavior, violence, and power of attorney
-- when i she doesn't give me even a modicum of respect
-- when i see her collusion with my father and his blind spot with her
-- when i see my father rejecting his sons
-- when i think about any of this

my sexuality uneasily escaping fantasy, ghosting everywhere
-- when the fantasy mixes art and the real world
-- when i my work makes others uncomfortable
-- when i can't deal with my own sexuality
-- when i feel i'm distorted, ugly, ogre, meagre
-- when i express myself poorly to others

fear of becoming homeless
-- when i find our financial situation one of constant loss and
struggle
-- when i try to come to grips with stress and find this inconceivable
-- when i find peacefulness inconceivable
-- when i worry that everything i've accomplished will disappear
-- when i fear i have accomplished nothing

fear of losing azure
-- when i realize she has to be saint and martyr to survive with me
-- when i inadvertently hurt or or withdraw because of triggering
-- when she gets exhausted over the same old thing of mine
-- when i feel i never pay her enough attention
-- when i realize how much i love her and it's frightening, thinking
she has saved me
-- when i worry about salvation from anywhere
-- when i feel hopeless

fear of triggering
-- when i feel the thoughts coming, and find no way to stop them
-- when my life seems almost catatonic and surviving under onslaught
-- when everything feels neutralized and joyless
-- when i recognize the history of the planet as one of continuous
slaughter
-- when i know that triggering only leads to the abyss
-- when i sense the chemicals taking over, the intrinsic processes
of my body out of control
-- when i sense that being out of control is a permanent condition
-- when i feel my mind turns against me in every direction
-- when i feel the presence of authority, for this always diminishes me
-- when i live a life of absolute and permanent regret
-- when my joy carries the seeds of its own destruction on the surface

for i know that triggering
-- is an irreversible descent, carrying my world with it
-- transforms my world into the world, so there is no escape
-- turns suicide neither into a question nor an answer, but defuge and
useless
-- when alternatives decay
-- when i can't speak but bluster, when i lose my breath, when i sweat
profusely, when i cry uncontrollably, when i become dizzy and stumble
about, when fear cries from every pore, when 'anything' sets me off,
sets me shaking, when the very thought of triggers bring legions of
them,
-- and when i, in despair, remain on the surface of spews, seethings,
abjections, untoward and extreme sexualities, pushing art and life to
the limit, returning with nothing but fear, shame, exhaustion -
returning with nothing usable, nothing at all

beautiful post-desecration images announce desecration to come

performances coming up, went into my Second Life site for which I do pay 
rent, and found it desecrated; there were 11, out of perhaps 30 objects, 
left. on an Anglo-Saxon list, I am reading about the hoard.

perhaps my objects spewed too many objects. perhaps they left an uncanny 
and featureless shadow. perhaps the desecration was deliberate. perhaps 
there was an odd server roll-back. I do have performances. so I scurry 
around and put in big messy things. it does look good and I practice a 
movement after my movements at first also did not work and the result was 
unspeakable. I could not speak. so now I have a new big messy environment 
on my small land in the sky and it does spew and I fear for desecration.
but the videos and the images from the bent debris of groundwater swells 
and other night secrets in unilluminated Second Life with some badness I 
do not know is around.

Kaddish


"The precision of the eschatological mind is a measure of its misery. The 
more you suffer, the more vividly you imagine the end of your suffering. 
But there is another reason for all these ultimate details. It is that 
there is no more evidence for a general promise than for a particular 
promise. The notion that the kaddish freezes hell for an hour and a half 
is not more ridiculous than the notion that the kaddish freezes hell for 
an hour, or the notion that there is a hell and the kaddish will affect 
it. These are all undisciplined ideas. So why not picture happiness in its 
particulars?"

"Go ahead, deny the reality of the world. You will still lie awake at 
night."

(from Leon Wieseltier, Kaddish)

Mines Today


I think of the isolated mining towns and rural countryside here as 
_alive_ in a perfect sense - it was the pallet of coal, of mining, of 
poverty and our tears are thin and pallid and mining brings out sorrow


So this text, they said? It's a world you're mining here, for better or 
buried within the mining of metals and coals, industries, whether mining 
or agricultural, chemical, or atmospheric, mining of metals and coals


This urgently converting execution mining could purchase - country court 
business of mining the planet. It's here that postmodernism is useful, 
recover from the mining catastrophe. I was surprised that, seemingly, she 
and if I can, I want to work on the mining, work on what's being brought 
buried within the mining of metals and coals, (playing the games of 
imitations, philosophies, sexualities, mining) tears are thin and pallid. 
mining brings out sorrow, end ending mining and among the mining of metals 
and coals, end ending the mining of metals and coals


This spelled the end of anthracite mining in the northern field, end of 
anthracite mining. The greatest was the Avondale shaft disaster in 
September, urgently converting, executiing mining could purchase country 
court countedted from the people, from the factories, even from some of 
others, there wasn't a mining family, retail in a mining community, you'd 
hear the mine applications of data mining and visualization


I will creatively - industries, whether mining or agricultural, chemical, 
or atmospheric. This and this was done thinking about mining in Pennsylva- 
nia, we were just abandoned against this peculiar meadow, the result of 
surface mining, depredation, of the mining company, resulting in exhausted 
land, industries, whether mining or agricultural, chemical, or atmospher- 
ic. This Mine: The male or female dances while mining the holes of the 
partner -

This and this was done thinkingabout mining in pennsylvnia, wwe were 
just mine: The male or female dances while mining the holes of the 
partner from trapping and hunting to mining, agriculture, and ranching 
the land, mining of metals and coals

The mines are killing them

there's a platform below for discussion and choreography demonstration.
but if you sit on the platform, you generate particle spew energy.
only one person can sit on the platform at a time.
there's no room for two people to sit on the platform together.
above the platform there are several running spews.
these spews continue no matter what else is happening.
but they're out of sight when you're on the platform.
when you're paying attention to the platform.
when you're paying attention to the activities on the platform.
you can sit just about anywhere on spheres or other objects.
almost all of them spew and interfere with vision, movement, sound.
for you can only move from sitting to standing.
and when you are sitting you are dancing and prancing.
your avatar is no longer yours.
your avatar is guided into frenzy by an object.
frenzy and spews might interfere with serious demonstration below.
