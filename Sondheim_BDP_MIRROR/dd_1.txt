We Look at Zero


Writing degree zero, rhetoric degree zero, pure one-on-one denotation, 
stripped zeros, presence and acknowledgement - we must pursue this to the 
extent that information pervades ontology and origin - pursue it, in 
other words, until that theoretical bursitis reveals itself, inverts: at 
this point, something of the West will emerge.

"_Absolute degree zero,_ then, would be a discourse reduced to its _essen-
tial semes_ (by a metalinguistic process, since these semes are not dis-
tinct lexical entities), that is, to the semes that we could not suppress 
without at the same time depriving our discourse of all signification."
(A General Rhetoric, Group Mu, Dubois/Edeline/Klinkenberg/Minguet/Pire/
Trinon.)

If the "there you are" functions as a _practical degree zero_ for Group
Mu, then the Levinasian "there is" might further reduce to _absolute._
However, there are other, more practical, matters themselves, such as
logical tautologies to examine in this regard.
