Very old sarangi instrument

http://www.alansondheim.org/oldsarangi1.mp3 bowed
http://www.alansondheim.org/oldsarangi2.mp3 plucked
http://www.alansondheim.org/oldsarangidroned.mp3 droned

traded for this today, I think probably mid-late 19th-century.
the skin is thick, the sympathetic strings difficult to tune.
in the process of restoration and setting up.
the first piece is learning a different bowing/fingering technique.
the second piece is plucking the strings.
the third piece is droning the instrument.
the first piece is rough to say the least.
the second piece is rag-tag sprightly.
the third piece is successful and almost song.
the first piece is playing harmonics and SA MA sa.
the second piece is roaming around the strings and body.
the third piece is full reverberation.
the first piece is partial reverberation.
the second piece is partial reverberation.
the third piece is full double early reflections.
the first piece is successful ten percent.
the second piece is successful forty percent.
the third piece is successful one hundred percent.
the first piece is waking up.
the second piece is afternoon.
the third piece is nighttime and now good night.

8       my guitar is my friend, i've had it for half a
        century, and it is my friend, and sounds happy
        so much when i play my friend my guitar

        http://www.alansondheim.org/practiced.mp3 (sarangi)        

        a practice session is a great place to try things out.
        i'd give this a rating of seventy-percent.
9       it's on the newer sarangi, just a few years old.
        i'm somewhere around the key of a minor.
10      it's good meditation music when the depths appear.
        or when the buzzing fades in and out, very controlled,
        controlled so you won't be offended or disturbed,
11      and there are only a few errors, which means only a few
12      unintended moments, for the most part everything is as
13      i heard it internally just at the moment of sounding.

images come to me in my sleep 
they leave me there exhausted 
breath is a luxuray
avatars form their inhuman

murmurs and texts in ontology
what falls apart comes apart
what comes apart falls apart
ontology and texts of murmurs

she or or he tries to push it away
he or or she pushing against nothing
she or or he sees there's nothing there
he or or she sees there's no air there
she or or he pushes furiously 
he or or she pushes amazingly and intensely
she or or he flails and pushes unfailingly
he or or she flies in the face of failing atmosphere
she or or he imagines he or or she on the lunar brightside
he or or she thinks she or or he on the lunar darkside
she or or he believes he or or she has a wonderful story
he or or she hysterically pushes and flails
she or or he cries out in the airless air oh woe is me
he or or she screams i can't believe this is happening
she or or he dances all the way down and up and down
he or or she prances all the way up and down and up
she or or he laughing cryingly goodbye we're having fun
he or or she cries laughingly hello we're working hard
she or or he says hello hello hello
he or or she says goodbye goodbye goodbye
