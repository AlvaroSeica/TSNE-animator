Omaha talk, (with examples shown) - this is an accounting for
undergraduates with little or no experience with virtual 
worlds. This might be of interest to you as well, even though 
it covers familiar ground.


Why this focus on the body?

We're increasingly living in virtual social worlds, without
face-to-face encounters.

I'm playing with the body in those spaces.

I'm interested in the sexual or the wounded or the pained body
in those spaces - how are these things represented?

Along with this - how can we extend dance and performance and 
the still image through manipulation of virtual bodies?

And how can virtual bodies be returned to the real world?

Bear in mind that the body is always inscribed, always partly
virtual - we carry the signs of our own histories and 
affiliations with us.

So I began to work with virtual characters in text-based virtual
worlds.

And then I switched over to images of virtual characters in
visual virtual worlds, which are in the process of becoming all
encompassing, 3-d - in two ways at least - augmented reality,
embedding the virtual in the real, and Second Life, embedding 
the real in the virtual.

I started to work with mocap - motion capture - in West Virginia
when I had access to the equipment. Everything depends on access.
I had further and more sophisticated access in Chicago, at 
Columbia College. Between these two places, I was able to work 
with modified motion capture files that would allow me to represent
sexuality, wounding, and pain in ways that involved distorting the
avatar body itself.

What I'm showing here, today, are these distortions, as well as 
some of the products that come from these distortions.

The products include dance and choreography, as well as 3-d print- 
ing of avatars, resulting in small sculptures.

The dance and choreography result in on-line performances in 
virtual worlds, which may be projected in rooms like this one, or
may be visited directly by other avatars in the virtual worlds.

All of this is also turned around: virtual world performance can 
be transformed and used by dancers and performers in the real 
world as well. We have some examples to show you.

Finally, there are mixed-reality performances, which occur between
real and virtual worlds, involving all sorts of embeddings.

What is the result of all of this?

Perhaps a better understanding of what it means to be human, to
'be' our bodies as well as to 'occupy' our bodies. 

And this might lead to a more humane future, where we're more
aware of what it means to be alive - really and virtually - in a
world of diminished resources.

It might also lead to an understanding of the politics of living
in such a world, and our duty to nourish it.

what the word speaks about is absence.
the 'about' divides the word, gnaws away from within.
why this distrust of words.
so much sound in 'that exists.'
it breaks or doesn't break with itself.
true humans know this is a weakness.
that sound and words are weakness.
men and women of action speak with their muscles elsewhere.
there's no need to continue on the path 'about.' 
one might say language devours language, no matter.
ceasing to speak means nothing to true men and women.
action is the only truth.
pressure is the only correspondence among things.

Wittgenstein:

Negation is an operation.
An operation denotes an operation.
Words are probes; some reach very deep; some only to a
little depth.
An operation, of course, does not say anything, only 
its result does; and this depends on its object.

words probe only words and negation annihilates emptiness.
negation is a potential for existence in language.
men and women of action know how false this is!
men and women of action, pay no attention!
words are the markings of the world.
they are the scat of the world.
no matter is found there, no gold, not even dross.

Wittgenstein:

The logical pseudo-functions _are_ operations.
Only operations can vanish!
The negative proposition excludes reality.
How can the all-embracing world-mirroring logic make use of
such special twiddles and manipulations? Only by linking 
all these together to form one _infinitely_ fine network, 
to form the great mirror.

men and women of action know that people can vanish too!
true man and women know it doesn't take a proposition 
to exclude!
the great mirror of language reflects only what issues
forth from mouth and lung.
if logic were all-embracing, one would look for the muscles.
muscles come in pairs, that is how pressure is formed.
pairs are always one woman and one man, Wittgenstein!

language in the background speaks to itself, says nothing!
language does not exist.
the hardness of existence is the chapel.
the hardness of existence is the truth of men and women.
the muscles of men and women, their suffering for a higher
cause.
their higher cause, their higher purpose.
their higher cause and purpose is about nothing.
their muscles transform nothing into action and purpose.
_we_ are the action and purpose of men and women of action
and purpose.
their hands press down upon us.
this is the language of the muscle, has no grammar, has
purpose.
to study the purpose of the muscle, apply the muscle.
to study the language of the mouth, apply the muscle.
i cease existence, i cease to exist.
i am overcome, i cease to overcome, i overcome.
i am overcome, i cease to overcome, i overcome.

[Wittgenstein, from Notebooks 1914-1916 trans. Anscombe.]

on the virtual, on intrusions, on signaling and communality

http://www.alansondheim.org/pizzeria.mp4 Azure shimmies oddly
http://www.alansondheim.org/singing.mp4 odder flute and voice
 in high wind while something exploded in the background, big
 emergency
http://www.alansondheim.org/woodpecker.mp4 downy woodpecker
 perfectly poised preening, performing
http://www.alansondheim.org/descentpain.mp4 i suppose descent
 of a tower from which singing and explosion were heard
http://www.alansondheim.org/ethno.mp4 zoo ethnography of
 humans with syringes and field notebooks among animals and
 virtual backdrops, virtual freedom, virtual communality
http://www.alansondheim.org/flagpain.mp4 fifty mile per hour
 wind and flag against sputtering sound from flag, sarangi,
 voice
http://www.alansondheim.org/jellyfish.mp4 because of the 
 untoward beauty, in spite of the aquarium, without sound,
 no mimickry

There are small shifts in the everyday behavior of men and
women, in the light, in reflections in the sky, in the 
slightest changes of pitch or echoes that appear to come 
from nowhere. magnified, the world suffers, organisms come
to life, things totter, topple, what is - was, what was - is
fast disappearing, what will be - has already corroded. zoo
animals live - are kept alive; the jellyfish remains mobile,
immobile; the flag might as well be a frond from sigillaria,
leaf from neuropteris; flute and voice are already lost in
the mythical darkness of wind and explosions; for a moment,
Azure moves to the rhythm of the corporate and time unwinds;
for a moment, this bird, this woodpecker, here, signals in a
search for food; and for a moment, descent takes the body 
from the wind, and the hollowed rasp of metal stairs takes
over. It is all already gone. It is all built on and from 
the everyday - look, you'll never guess what happened to me
this morning, who could of thought something like that would
occur in the middle of the night. We live among these 
tremblings, not long enough for the grand cycles to mean 
anything more than the flattened pages of history: we have
to read the world in such a small amount of time, everything
is lost, everything disappearing, where we were born is 
never bearing down, where we are headed is all too familiar,
everything trembles, shudders, everything is otherwise...

Bowing

Bowing or bowing, bowing down, playing music, doubled tautness: Already
I want to add something (to the essay, to the sound, to etiquette), of
the object, the bow (tying the hair, playing music, positioning the
body), which is an alteric object, other in any case (culture, viola
case), what one might call 'that' object (in the sense that science is
'that' procedure, phenomenology, ideology), which produces, by a 
certain and constant swaying (ponytail, body, viola bow), a sound that
seems unnatural, manufactured, elsewhere (swish, the engagement of
strings, perfume), in relation to the bending body (proper position of
the arm, chest, ponytail left and right!), setting up a particular 
rhythm (etiquette, fiddling, swaying), in engagement with etiquette
(string tautness and rosin, hierarchy and context, boys and girls),
these actions already so close to the dance (pocket fiddle, twist, 
noh), the whole a motif for the swinging of language (notes, respect,
glances), mobile lexicon and phonemes (singing, giggling, foxtrot,
whispers, murmurs), oh! I've lost the essay (song, return, crying,
ribbons) in the beautiful movement of the bow (ship, viola music,
curtseying, smiles, sashays, readings, writings, essays, assays)
back and forth and playing (bowing, ponytail, viola bow, swingings,
lefts and rights!, ribbons, giggles, smiles, swayings, backs and
forths! ups and downs!), playings!
