[for all]X{not X --> 0}
Therefore not X is taken to 0 (null set)
Therefore not X is always already processed to 0
Therefore not X is equivalent to 0
Therefore not x is identical to 0
Therefore X --> V (universal set)
Therefore X is always already processed to V
Therefore X is equivalent to V
Therefore X is identical to V

Alan Sondheim this came on the heels of a first post I wrote 
thinking about ISIS and the idea of exclusion - from for all x 
not x tends towards zero - to x is identical with the universal 
set, not x is identical with the null set. I'm playing off ideas 
of purity and exclusion - things like the Pale etc. or the 
theory in Kristeva's Powers of Horror or the earlier Mary 
Douglas' (sp?) Purity and Danger. that which is not for me, in 
other words, is against me, and must be annihilated, and 
annihilation must be carried out to the limit. so for me the 
movement is from 'sending' or projecting not-x into the null 
set, to making it equivalent, to making it identical - a 
movement maybe from epistemology to ontology - the not-x become 
- _are_ inherently non-being, eliminated. -

Alan Sondheim X doesn't equal not-X. The world divides and 
hardens between X and not-X; it's a classical division so that 
the intersection of X and not-X is the null set. What I'm trying 
to present is the idea of an expulsion and an annihilation of 
what's expelled. ISIS wants a purified caliphate with only 
believers; non-believers are expelled or murdered. Could you 
elaborate on the rest of your post? I'm trying to say then that 
the annihilation is that of the Other - the Other isn't 
permitted to survive, and with the death of the Other, the Other 
becomes identified with 0.

Alan Sondheim because it's about ISIS and this is the second in 
the series -

Alan Sondheim trying to come to grips with annihilation when for 
example beheading occurs, not only to foment terror, but as an 
act of piety, as part of the natural order of things -

Alan Sondheim in the above, a signal is sent, becomes furious, 
begins to dissolve, the dance is violent and sexual like a 
machine gun

Alan Sondheim amounting to firing a gun but now up close, the 
taste of the gristle, trophy of the severed head, or there were 
hands chopped, eyes gouged

Alan Sondheim at times anything that can be removed

Alan Sondheim what does this, where is a response, what is this?

ISISMACHINE i can't do this
it doesn't come out right comes out wrong
ISIS = perfect humanism
demarcation and classification of the world
if you're not part of the answer you're part of the problem
anyone can use the slogan ISIS = mathesis
i am an arm of the equation i can't do this
why are you not seeing new ISIS philosophy
there's none other = ISIS exists
too many endgames at play 
too many games the war machine ISISMACHINE is machine
is machine broken is perfect machine
art-philosophy machine sex machine i can't do this
i can't do this i just can't do this

_the they._ _the they_ mask. _the they_ masquerade.
already forced into a vanishing of alterity. already _they_ won.
already he won. already leaders. already led.
the violence of _the they._ the violence of a leader.
_they_ buy us into _their_ myth. _they_ caress us.
_our_ myth.

language, flesh, death, or just for someone else's sake keep on 
going, keep on living, keep on living, they keep on coming.  
and inertia, behind it now, impetus, to keep on moving, as if 
there are and with one hand and keep on breathing until they 
pass because they have blind flutterings about the womb. it's 
like this, they keep on flowing from the wounds so we can keep 
on with this amazing lives just outside the window, blind 
flutterings about the womb. you decide hope manage find some 
peace doing it, keep on, keep on living. we've got that and they 
keep on coming, keep on going, i'm afraid i have to keep on 
living in this hated world - you'd have to keep on living, deal 
with them - so they don't fall down, they keep on moving - so 
you don't fall down, you keep on moving - blind flutterings 
about the womb

he's going to keep on going, they keep on flowing from the 
wounds so i hold on - all that remains imminent, perhaps less, 
unresonant, so i keep on them, and those walls keep on crackling 
and the light keeps coming through, than that which you've 
already found, you have to keep on, keep on flowing from the 
wounds you decide hope manage find some peace doing it, keep on 
already across cliffs unafraid 2 fall & get up again and keep 
on, they keep on coming, they keep on coming, _they_ keep on





ISIS EXPANSION BY FORCE AND TERROR

FORCE = TERROR
WORD = NOTHING

http://www.alansondheim.org/260.jpg

or think of it like this:
for all X, not-X tends towards zero, not the null set
a move from set theory to simple arithmetic
whatever isn't x must be eliminated 
numbers brought down until the slate is cleansed kill-delete
then not-X = 0, the epistemology is complete
and in the future not-X is identical with zero,
 history erased, ontology cleansed - fundamentals
