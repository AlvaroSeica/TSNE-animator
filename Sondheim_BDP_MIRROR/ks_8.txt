Jennifer-Effusions

Jennifer smells, perfume emanating from her body, and that's how I know
it's Jennifer. I can't place the scent, the quality or name, can't place
the region of application, folds or furrows, plains or plateaus of flesh.
An effusion, general and fuzzy topography - there is Jennifer, I can smell
her a mile away. The scent of a woman holds me, in abeyance ,,,,

Now you may know the smell is not from any orifice, any hole in any skin;
the body is disarticulated, no beginning and no ending, suffused in soft
and warm air. Lovely pillowy body, comma and comma and ,,,, And this is
the nature of a coupling, not linkage, concatenation-Jennifer or aggregate
Jennifer, absorption Jennifer, menstrual or milky Jennifer, Jennifer-in-
transition, Jennifer-transitive, Jennifer-Alan-transsexing, at a loss but
never lost ,,,,
