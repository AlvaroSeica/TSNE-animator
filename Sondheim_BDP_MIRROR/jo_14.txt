Red Mercury

To have mix't plutonium well within the sphere
That draws the thing towards its conclusion, near
Mercury, Red Mercury, dissolved, amalgamated
Between the doubled spheres, coagulated
As source of particles, reaction, raw reaction
That lends performance to another action's action:
Detonation blurs the bomb; the sun is churned
Within, while buildings, carbon, oxygen are burned
Fierce among the doubled pounds of nitro gained
Heat, more particles, cheap nuclear's attained.
Don't run, hide _the thing_ within your fist;
Nothing is left, and nothing's hardly missed.
