Do Men Cry, By Jennifer


No, men do not cry, and I am not sure they could be Taught to. I have seen
many men and they do not cry, even when there are things that would make
Them cry if they could. I am sure of this from my obversation Study. Now I
have seen many a distrawt woman who will be sitting in a Chair looking
very sad with tears runing down her Face. She is doing Crying. And then a
man will come Over to that woman and he will put his Hand on her showlder.
He will Stand there just with his Hand on her showlder. And she will put
Her hand on his Hand. Then she may not be So distrawt, I do not know from
obversation study. But he will not Cry too.
