Typology of Telecommunications in Non-Metropolitan Areas (North America):

Electromagnetic Spectrum, atmospheric transmission:
 1 Radio, AM - usually local origination, often agricultural information,
religious
 2 Radio, FM - often centralized feeds interspersed with limited local
content
 3 Television, VHF - network and independents
 4 Television, UHF - religious, often local origination
 5 Radio, Shortwave - limited use in terms of international transmissions
 6 Radio, Amateur - community building, emergency uses
 7 Radio, Packet - experimental, community building, Internet
 8 Television, Amateur - experimental
 9 Telephone, Cellular - limited usage in non-metropolitan areas
 10 Telephone, Cellular/International - very limited usage
 11 Walkie-Talkie - agricultural or construction site 
 12 CB Radio - highway information, limited community building
 13 Beeper Technology - limited usage
 14 Global Positioning Satellite Technology - surveying, site-work
 15 Fire, Police, Utilities Frequencies - extremely common
 16 Television, Satellite - becoming extremely common
 17 Microwave, Satellite Linkages - connection into local networks
 18 Satellite Weather Imaging Systems - standardized

Fiber-Optic Cable Systems:
 19 Cable Television - extremely common in some areas
 20 Computers/Cablemodems - will become common within a decade (Internet)
 21 Decodable Information-on-Demand - will become common

Twisted Wire Systems:
 22 Telephone - ubiquitous in many rural areas
 23 Computers/Telephonemodems - becoming common (Internet)
 24 Fax Systems - common for commercial enterprises, agribusiness

Optic:
 25 Laser Surveying - standardized
 26 Weather Radar Systems - standardized

Acoustic:
 27 Voice
 28 Sirens and Whistles - fire, noon, etc.

Almost all of these appear as synchronic (satellite imagery, for example,
is an exception); body language, mail, and transportation are not consid-
ered.
