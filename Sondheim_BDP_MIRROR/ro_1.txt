Cavern Song

http://www.alansondheim.org/guanzi1.mp3
http://www.alansondheim.org/guanzi2.mp3

The guanzi is a Chinese double-read instrument, ancestor
of the Japanese hichikiri. Mine is in F; I put a hichikiri
read on it and made these two pieces, mixing jazz phrasing
with taksim phenomenology. In post-production I added
studio reverb; this helps connect the phrases, which are
far too dependent on my lungs. So the result is a kind of
cavern song; I think of this as the origins of the epic
before words transformed ikon into index and gesture into
symbol. Maybe the uncanniness of reverberation is a memory
of language's origin.


Here's where I make my mistake

Here's where I make my mistake -
in thinking that music is virtual,
in thinking that music is thought,
is philosophical thought

Here's where it unravels -
that it remains untranslated,
that it remains untranslatable,
that this is an accomplishment

If I could say what needs expression -
I wouldn't need guqin,
I wouldn't need oud or sarangi,
I'd speak with uncanny depth

If you could hear what I'd say -
you'd know the basic things,
structures and their absence,
and your speech would be mellifluous

But music carries nothing -
it wanders among the body,
it saturates the flesh,
its illusion is illusion

This is my mistake -
I play as a form of thinking,
and nothing is ever thought,
while philosophy is sleeping

It's better not to listen -
you'll learn more in that direction,
with your fingers and your mind,
forgetting my illusion

Mostly I keep to myself -
hoping my songs sing wisdom,
my songs are full of bones,
my bones are white mistakes

I slide one note to another -
together they mean nothing,
separate they mean less,
your mind breaks in the spaces

Music cannot think -
its dumbness rattles the body,
it's been my own illusion
to think it thinks the world

You'll learn nothing from me -
only that I'm a fraud,
that I have nothing to offer,
beyond strange sounds and songs

My songs are wordless songs -
with the help of a friend they're talking,
but they're drowning in noise and music,
they're lost in the roar of the world

The world crashes down on my music -
collapsing my world and my language,
you know I have nothing to say,
if I did I'd say it clearly

I'm a fake and cheating at depth -
music's one note to another,
nothing else goes on at all,
this is my biggest mistake

How clever I am even here -
as if philosophy were that easy,
I'm getting away with nothing,
foolishly repeating myself

Turn aside and return to the books -
where truth appears in array,
where debate engenders thinking,
where becoming tends towards thought

Where philosophy is born -
and things are understood,
not like the noise I make,
the commotion of my sound

"Here's where I made my mistake -
in thinking music virtual,
in thinking music thought,
noise as philosophy"

As if they were conjoined -
I continue to repeat,
conjunctions fall apart,
I practice nothing now.




Bow/Bow

Start with a bow producing a continuous note on a string, in 
general a single string, a single note that's mobile, that may be 
transformed, may or may not come to an end within what might be 
considered human time, the time of a piece of music, the time of 
attention economy, the temporality of memory itself.

One hand holds the bow. Let's say the right hand. The finger, 
wrist, and the rest of it, position and move the bow across the 
strings. Some bows require more than this, variable tensioning of 
the strings as the bow is moved; the finger do this. But the right 
hand is somewhat mute, the fingers hold the bow, the bow is moved, 
the hand moves the bow, the fingers are static in relation to the 
bow - relative, rather than absolute, addresses. 

The promise of the bowed string is ontology, the condition of a 
somewhat permanent event drawing on the spectrum of sound and the 
body. The promise is that of a continuous event as well, one 
driven into tracks and tracking, spoors and divisions related to 
drones and natural temperament. The waveforms are inconceivable, 
impossible to grasp. The tracking murmurs in the blood; the spoor 
bleeds. 

Drones invert the sound and its rhapsodic; the cavern extends 
outward from the sarangi which reflects pretty much what the body 
churns. The cavern is the world reliant on atmosphere, on air, on 
transmission carriers, Higgs bosons holding the skein in place. We 
wave at one another. 

The left hand, sinister, labors; it's at work making culture. It 
touches the strings that the right hand, the bow hand, only hints 
at. The right hand's tacit knowledge is misplaced; the left hand 
is in the material itself, the depths of the cavern. The left hand 
inscribes; the right hand engages inscription. The right hand 
transcribes the materiality of the left. The promise is ontology.

(The bow must coax the string, the resonance. The string replies in 
fits and spurts; the way of the string is resistance; the way of 
the bow is supplication. Hence the double-meaning of bowing - the 
production of sound, and the humbling graciousness of one and 
another human in relation.)

Philoctetes is a mythological character from the Greek tragedy by 
Sophocles, a warrior who was on his way to the Trojan War when a serpent 
bit him. The smell of his wound was so noxious that he was left on the 
island of Lemnos and ostracized by his countrymen. When the war started, 
Cassandra, the seer, said that without the bow of Heracles, which is only 
possessed by Philoctetes and which he inherited from his father, the war 
could not be won. Many believe that it's the Trojan Horse that is the key 
to winning the war, but actually it's the bow of Heracles.
----->
So the Argives have to humbly go back to Philoctetes and ask him to rejoin 
them. At first he says no. From all the pain that you have given me, even 
if I could regain my glory, I reject you, even if it's at the cost of my 
own redemption. Even at the cost of reconstituting my own existence. 
Eventually, there is a deus ex machina that comes in to relieve him of the 
burden of this decision, and so the Argives regain the bow and eventually 
go on to win the war. http://philoctetes.org/about/story_of_philoctetes/

Gabrielle's Gallop

http://lounge.espdisk.com/archives/902 (cobza, easiest access)
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/GabriellesGallop.mp3 (cobza)

Here, the cobza is played with the fingers, with a pick worn on
the index finger as well. The instrument has 10 strings, in
courses 3-2-2-3 or EEe-AA-dd-ggg; the strings 'splay out' from 
the neck nut, until, near the picking area, they're independent
and harp-like. This gives the player the opportunity for all 
sorts of new and specialized techniques impossible on tightly-
coursed instruments like the mandolin or 12-string guitar. The
fretless fingerboard/neck is only 5 inchees in length. The
piece here is Gabrielle's Gallop - Gabrielle from Xena Warrior
Princess, riding and battling on her own; the sound of the
gallop resonates throughout.

Brooklyn Heats Up


http://www.alansondheim.org/bigotry.jpg

Lots of ways to read this, but combined with the assault 
against me, general anger on the streets, a crime-wave 
in our neighborhood, homelessness and despair on the rise,
the local cops refusal to do their duty - the message is
clear. I just don't know whose side anyone is on. There
was a boosterism article in USA Today about the area - 
and again some of the comments hinted at violence to come.
NY State has the greatest disparity of any, between rich
and poor, and this is one of the results. Meanwhile the
arena, which is creating all this tension, seems to be 
somewhat on schedule - lots of money to be made from the
"Brooklyn Nets" to Jay-Z and Dylan and Streisand, Come
and trash us; the police don't give a damn.

Traffic

http://www.alansondheim.org/traffic.mp4 Part 1.

So Julu Twine goes to Open Sim and tries to set up house.
But she can't put anything down on the ground.
She's just stopped. She doesn't know what to do.
She decides to wear everything she owns.
Everything she owns is moving.
She wears everything she owns and she just stands there.
Then she does a little dance.
She gives birth to herself and the whole wide world.
She can do this cause she's got everything with her.
She didn't leave anything out. She didn't drop anything. 
She couldn't drop anything. She couldn't make anything stick.
She was stuck without the sticking but she danced.
She was stuck about the sticking. She got everything.
She got clothes and everything and other stuff. Part 2.
So Julu dances in Open Sim and she thinks Open Sin.
And she thinks Open Sin and I'm all alone.
And she thinks What a loss I'm all alone alas.
She's all alone a lass but she has everything.
So she does this little dance. Part 3.

Julu Twine finds herself with many things to do and drop.
Julu Twine drops everything and buils herself a home.
The home moves! She can't stop it! Round and round!
Sometimes Julu Twine goes for a ride but not now!
She just wants to rest in Home-Whirling-Ville!
Julu sits and makes new and many things and drops them.
Things are dropping everywhere!
Julu jumps on them!
Julu! Julu!
Julu has a home!




Sung Lisu


an instrument of the Lisu in Northern Thailand. There are other 
names as well (subu for one); it's related to the sanxien and
shamisen. It's from northern Thailand, but there are relations
with Tibet, and so forth. JSTOR has an article on Lisu music 
and there's one beautiful video at 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCVaEwxE134&feature=related
I'm in Colorado and made an exceptionally poor recording with
the instrument, also called dsyboo with umlauts over the o's; 
I have only a small voice recorder here. So I transferred with
the recorder speaker into a mic into Audacity and then took
the .wav file into Audition. By that time the sound was totally
transformed, so I went with it and made the following piece -
which sounds nothing like the instrument, but is, I think, of
interest. When I return to New York, I'll do a proper recording.
I've included a picture of the instrument as well.

these distended in-formed my thinking among the series
of house-buildings, solitary wanderings, Cicero and
Caesar, clutter and remnants, and how could they be
otherwise; recently my dreams have become nightmares,
perhaps I fear for my sanity, or even the capitalizing
of i, inserting myself where i don't belong:

Two sung lisu solos

http://lounge.espdisk.com/archives/904 (easier)
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/sunglisua.mp3 
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/sunglisub.mp3

The tuning is EEA and the instrument is difficult;

strings are close together and unwound metal.
My music on it is similar to my cura cumbus music,
but harder to play, because it's fretless.
