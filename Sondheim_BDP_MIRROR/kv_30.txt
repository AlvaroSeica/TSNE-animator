Prayer Heals


And prayer can move worlds. It is always a question of grouping, for the
inertia of non-praying overcomes prayer, and the inertia of taking-sides
collapses wave-forms into miasma. 

There is a certain violence and greed in prayer, which makes it overly
delicate. In fact, prayer is an afterthought or defect in the cosmos; it
was never intended. The violence is implicit; achieving one's goals is
almost always at the expense of another. Even altruism requires the at-
tention of one's superiors. (Such may or may not exist; it is the lang-
uage of performativity, the breath of prayer, that creates the desirable
end. Gods need not apply.)

And all must pray for prayer to succeed, the waves of doubters or non-
believers need be kept at bay. Be aware that the prayer of a single man or
woman against the prayer of another is enough to destroy them both, and
even more. For prayer is a delicate thing, having nothing to do with gods
or spirits, and everything to do with balance clearly toppling among both
friends and enemies.

If prayer were not imbalance, the universe would be brute. It is the in-
ert that creates the effect of the inefficacy of prayer; open the portals
for everyone to another better world, and everyone will follow.
