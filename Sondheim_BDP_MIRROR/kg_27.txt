DIVINE MOUNTAINS EMBRACE YOU GENTLY AND WARMLY
PLEASE ENJOY THE EARTHLY PARADISE OF KIRISHIMA TO YOUR HEART'S CONTENT,
TAKING A HOT BATH WHICH SPRINGS OUT FROM FLANKS OF THE MOUNTAINS, AND
SAVORING THE TASTE OF VARIOUS MOUNTAIN AND RIVER PRODUCS.
PLEASURE SPREADS OUT ON THE MAP AND THE KNAPSACK IS FULL OF JOY.
IF YOU GO OUT JUST FOR A STROLL, YOU MAY COME ACROSS AN UNEXPECTED DRAMA.
BESIDE, THERE ARE MANY WATERFALLS FLOWING DOWN LIKE WHITE WATER-CURTAINS
IN THE VICINITY OF KIRISHIMA.
THE MAGNIFICENT BEAUTY OF NATURE COULD BE SENSED FULLY WITH THE WHOLE BODY
BY TRAVERSING ALMOST ALL THE MOUNTAINS IN THE HIRISHIMA RANGE.
THE HOT SPRINGS IN KIRISHIMA ARE EMBRACED BY MOUNTAINS, JUST LIKE BEING
HUGGED BY MOTHER.
