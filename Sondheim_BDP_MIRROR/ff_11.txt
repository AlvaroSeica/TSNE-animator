Voyeur-Machine


Hordes 
Groups of waiting males, nothing is happening here. Someone sleepily
caresses his penis; no one says anything. Eyes half-closed, talk about
ref surfing (reflector surfing, moving across CuSeeMe), languor. It's
clear that connections are sometimes one-to-one, that private refs sur-
round me like a halo.

Woman
Coming into the plain, and everyone goes polite. Someone smokes, someone
else warns him to put it out, could start a fire. Please won't you let us
see your breasts. Please what is your URL. Please I will take my _close_
off. Please you are so beautiful. You can see fire in the distance.

Women 
Roam across the territory and it's new to them and the men. Everyone
gauges the distance to their sex; everyone's wary, sitting in a circle.
Almost-conversations are stillborn, aborted, literally aborted. The sky
is a sullen grey. 

Scopophilia
Structures virtual subjectivity, explodes: The very sight of them! The
slightest appearance of an areola lends itself towards further paste;
the territory is tried and found wanton. The drive silences and cancels;
tumescent computer becomes breast, nipple, vagina, penis, frozen, melted
at the oral stage. It's the mouth which faces, defaces, the screen.

Deer 
And other animals cross the savannah, leaving spoors, traces, demarca-
tion. Who will live by the smouldering plains, rain held off in the dis-
tance, our machines curtaining flesh with flesh, ground to sky. Not so
much a question as a period in our lives scuttled by charred bones. The
fires have passed, past.
