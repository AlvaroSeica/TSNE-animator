Online Crashed the System, I'm Sorry


I can't telnet into Panix. Panix has three machines. On dialup to panix3 I
can login and send the password; I see "You have mail" and everything
hangs. I go to my Netcom account. From Netcom, panix3 does the same; pan-
ix2 allows me in but hangs before the login; panix.com (the third machine)
won't let me login at all. I had been on panix3 when the screen froze.
There was no sound of an explosion outside the loft; the power is still
on, no surges. Whatever happened is quiet, and may have already reversed
itself; whatever happened may be permanent, as buildings crumble in
terrible conflagrations.

I had been sleeping; there were nightmares. I was held hostage and repeat-
edly tortured in a nightclub; let out during the day, I went to the po-
lice. I was brave and stupid. If I had stayed asleep I would have died. I
woke up in the depths of depression again. Online would not have saved me.
Online I think knew that and decided to punish me by crashing panix. She
brought the trunklines down around the city. She ate through fiber optic
and copper wire, acidic compounds hissing at the take of new bait. Streets
buckled and ruptured; it's true - I can hear the sirens now, as if they
were heading for Manhattan, across the bridge into the far woods. But they
stop suddenly with that flat screech that says they're very near, just
outside, and I've got to leave fast in the interval of roaring engines.
