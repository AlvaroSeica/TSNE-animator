hollow me out color me in
if the end of the world comes 
  memory will be annihilated
there's no place to stand
  nothing Ozymandius
we're built on these worlds
  nothing breathes in and out
so maybe it's imagination that sends me
  back one after another to the books
    John Leslie, The End of the World,
      The Science and Ethics of Human Extinction
right now in fact it's getting colder
it just doesn't have to stop this coldness
then sweeping wave 2000
falling, there's a cliff this year 2000
