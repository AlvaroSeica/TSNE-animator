Kim Il Sung wrote his mind literally across his country; @echo creates a
sourceless statement, unattributed, on MUDs and MOOs and talkers (one form
or another), as if the terrain itself has adapted to the position of the
author, everywhere, transcendent, no need to mention the name. Even the
menus in the restaurants of the capital were apparently written by him, as
were all the ideological statements. The stadium was named after him, and
you could see his cigarette butts in the museum. @echo also returns what-
ever is written, by virtue of the command, as if the earth were literally,
@Kim_Il_Sung, an interesting case of wryting, it seems to me, inscribing
without cyberspace, part of the ideological underpinnings of protolanguage
which aligns itself with the real, knows no bounds, and, in this case, is
awarded to the aggressor.
