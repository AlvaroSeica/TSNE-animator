So where is this work? Scattered among chapbooks, print-on-demand books 
(which are never available for review or perusal), within the Internet 
Text and at the website I use to temporarily store files (temporarily - 
given the limited storage I have). There are archived materials at the 
Ohio State University in Columbus; there are materials that will be 
archived at New York University in Manhattan. There are over twenty-five 
hours of films still at Filmmakers Coop, where they sit and decay. There 
are several cds, and three non-publish-on-demand books, none of which 
discuss any of the above. There have been a number of manuscripts which 
continue to gather dust. At one point I self-published several dvds and 
texts, but that proved impractical.

What happened? My work is difficult to grasp; it moves too quickly among 
disciplines and (artistic) communities; almost all of it is non-academic 
in style; it's unsellable; it's parasitic on email lists, and appears (as 
this text appears) only as noise; it's sent to /dev/null one way or ano- 
ther; at times it appears too neurotic, sexual, intense, moribund, diffi- 
cult, or depressive; it takes far too much time to read and/or process; it 
seems to short-circuit itself; I'm socially awkward, etc. etc.

What will happen? Surely nothing until after my death, and then, if the 
works survive on someone's machine, something might come of them; however 
by then, they'll most likely be outdated.

This can only end on an "ah, well...".
