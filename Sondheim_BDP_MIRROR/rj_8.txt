Circle of Crosses - Fire Museum (39.955117?N 75.161240?W) and Tequila 
Sunrise Records (39.969203?N 75.14505?W) present this gathering of 
guitar-driven emanations, the first side leafy, lyrical and acoustic, the 
second side an astringent application of electric gnarl. ?Circle of 
Crosses? brings together folk pythia Dora Bleu (guitar and vocal) with 
psych-improv wizards Sam Shalabi and Tom Carter (guitars and other 
instruments). It links Tripoli (32?548N 13?119E) to Washington D.C 
(38?5342.4N 77?0212.0W) and Houston (29?4546N 95?2259W), not to mention 
Mile End (45?3130N 73?3500W) to Louvain-la-Neuve (50? 40 4 N, 4? 36 42 E). 
Consider these songs map coordinates for safe-houses from das 
?berw?ltigensein, a set of precise locales for ecstasy, atheist shrines, 
or open spaces for reverie in the forgotten recesses of the planetary 
connectome.
