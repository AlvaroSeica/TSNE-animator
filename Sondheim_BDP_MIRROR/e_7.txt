Kentucky and the Blood


bewilderment in real life
the stamp or swamp of life
the bamboo thicket, grazing life i'd say
teeming pools of microscopic life
eyes opened wide living blood of the lord
the blood which drips from the cross drips for thee
the blood which swells the wood swells for thee
the blood which rusts the nails rusts well for thee
blood spurts in a chaotic trajectory
you can't have one and the other i'd say
you've got noise and a lot of it
in Kentucky my old home is old and i'd say i'd say
i can see the land swell swell around you like a wound
say see the land swell around you like a wound

wherever i go i say, i don't know what these people do here
nor do i know where to go to ask the questions
but there are questions i'd ask of the blood
or of the wood swollen hard by the banks of the blood
by "its" banks
downpoured from me, downpoured to you, 
the lord short-circuited, lord tethered to its moorings,

"There's won-der-ful pow'r in the blood. There is pow'r, pow'r, 
won-der-work-ing pow'r In the blood of the Lamb; There is pow'r, pow'r, 
won-der-work-ing pow'r In the precious blood of the Lamb."

( L.E.Jones, There is Power in the Blood )
