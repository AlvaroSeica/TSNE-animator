the last of it

distance along finger tips. 
beginning over again, emerging. the translucency of skin. 
we speak to one another with our skin. the opacity of skin. 
  your love is grabbed by azure and you - 
  keep together, swallow dirt, eat each other.
this is my last time here. 
these languages begin to fade. the transparency of skin. 
your shadows, pens and pencils, are outside my inherent languages.
your love destroys my languages.
they churn dark in the valley where you huddle.
  your love is grabbed by azure and you - 
  keep together, swallow dirt, eat each other.
your dead words are your pens and pencils, skin and languages? 
we speak to one another with our skin. the opacity of languages.
pens and pencils, machines.
the transparency of words, your shadows.
  your love is grabbed by azure and you - 
  keep together, swallow dirt, eat each other.
