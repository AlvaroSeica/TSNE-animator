from the autonomic to control of anomaly in production - for example, 
taking into consideration finger-board warping, pad leaking, or small 
cracks that might develop in chromatic harmonicas. (Of course this also 
reinscribes the music, which is now of these anomalies as well, part and 
parcel of production.)
