	BE KILLED BY PILLS TV AND RAP AND ROLL YOU WOULD
	BE THRILLED TO DIE BY PLANES OR CARS YOU COULD
	NOT BE WEARING SEAT BELTS DRINKING HEAVY DRINK YOU WOULD
	BE SWUNG ON SWINGS WITHOUT RESTRAINING STRAPS YOU COULD
	NOT BE V-CHIPPED UNDER LOCK AND KEY PROTECTION YOU WOULD
	NOT HAVE PROZAC XANAX VALIUM AND IN NO WAY YOU COULD
	SURVIVE A PAST ALIVE WITHOUT LAW ANGEL GUARDING YOU WOULD
	HAVE DIED FROM FROM CLASSICS UGLY STORIES YOU COULD
	HAVE DIED FROM UGLY SEXY PICTURES VIOLENT UGLY YOU WOULD
	BE RAPED BY TEACHER PRIEST AND COLORED INTERNET YOU COULD
	BE HOME ALONE MY LITTLE FUTURE NATION! YOU WOULD 
	BE FUTURE NATION FUTURE MY BRAVE AND FUTURE NATION!
