(Beware is the cry or condition of prophecy. Robbed of its indexicality,

it remains the performance of the pure, an "a" opening into a void

cluttered with apparitions, behaviors of shames or guilts, the shifted,

sleazy personages, twilight zones of all sorts. Beware is what one prof-

fers for the future, for one's survival. It is what I can leave this 

earth, my legacy. It is what will bring splendor and misrecognition to

my memory. It is what will create an other apparition, just as this

language sings to you, long after I am gone.)
