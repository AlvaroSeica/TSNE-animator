Useless Expenditure of Energy


Set x = 1
Procedure A
Multiply x by 1.
If x is greater than 1 then stop; else
Goto Procedure A.

Set x = 1
Procedure B
Add x by 0.
If x is greater than 1 then stop; else
Goto Procedure B.

I will set these programs to run and I will run these programs.
I will run them in fast compiled languages on and on and on.
Sooner or later they will stop and I will have made something.
What I will have made will not be too large or too small.
What I will have made will just stop the programs.
That will be a useless expenditure of energy because I could have just
decided to have stopped them by myself.
