Seduction


"Formerly Duke Ling of Ch'u State liked his knights to have small waists. 
Thus it was that his court officers all limited themselves to one meal a
day. Having exhaled their breath they tightened their belts. It was only
by leaning against a wall that they could stand up. Within a year the
whole court was black in the face. There is the fact: the sovereign called
for it, and the ministers were able to do it." [...] "None the less, the
knights and gentlemen everywhere say that it [i.e. all-embracing love]
cannot be put into practice." "I, to-day, can practice all-embracingness." 
"I regard all-embracingness as exactly right. In this way quick ears and
clear eyes co-operate in hearing and seeing, arms and legs are immeasur-
ably strengthened to co-operate in movement and action, whilst those who
possess the Way co-operate untiringly in teaching it." [...] "It is incom-
prehensible what it is that makes the knights on hearing about all-inclu-
siveness oppose it." (Mo Ti, from Mo Tzu trans. E. R. Hughes.)
