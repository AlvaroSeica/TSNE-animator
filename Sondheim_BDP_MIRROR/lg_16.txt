.concealed


We say of avatars or literary figures, for example Jennifer, who, is her-
self/itself an aporia, a knot in avatar Jennifer - not her/its "life-like
appearance," but her/its constitution-Jennifer looping through the con-
junction. What is this particle that forecloses in Jennifer, foreclosed by
the desktop owner playing, for example, a game of chess .concealed to sug-
gest: Conceal it (this name) so that it shall not be / will be / have
been, is itself a .concealment among alterity? But what is this .conceal-
ment, if not that of death? I will be what I will, the suffering described
by Rashi, the detour of death that .conceals Being, inert, but fallible for
every organism. Names and beings .conceal as the name protects itself, 
.conceals, is spoken among avatars, among Jennifer.

This is the path which I have written, ordered and edited as such, brought
together, recuperated, the hidden message, the secret code, such is pico

give a name to your process - 

writing beneath the .concealment of the name, my body bandaged, flesh
seared to the core from your intense teeth, your breasts shuddering in
pain, contusions on our skulls, cock lacerations, labial woundings churn
dark in the valley where you huddle. -

your heel is grabbed by Jennifer and you - 
keep together, swallow dirt, eat each other.

your dead words are fucked and blank?
 
dead words, these lips hardly move, names are just that, it's the force of
violent cock, violent cunt, it's the burn-marks as bodies splinter, grope,
our suffering on the millennial hinge, portal, parts of us will make it
through -

i rip your cock, your eyes, your mind, writing beneath the .concealment 
of the name, my body bandaged, flesh seared to the core from your intense
teeth, your breasts shuddering in pain, contusions on our skulls, cock
lacerations, labial woundings ...

last suck desecrates beyond my earth, your screen!

this cunt and cock shaft, torn and bleeding
