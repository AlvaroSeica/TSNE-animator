Michael Current, Difficulty


As you know, Michael Current and I co-founded Cybermind, and he died
shortly after. Now, more than two years later, there is a minor industry
created around his death. I reprinted his story in Being On Line, and Mia
Lipner created an audio piece based somewhat on his posts to Future Cul-
ture. She is interviewed about it (in part) in Women and Performance. Greg
Ritter has written about him, and Katie Argyle has described events around
his death in a recently published essay. I've talked about the same in va-
rious lectures. Being On Line is dedicated to him, as was the Cybermind96
conference to a certain extent. I'm certain there is more. 

I don't know exactly how to think about this, the expansion occasioned by
sudden death. And by "minor industry," I mean in the sense of culture, not
production, but even here it is as if the tragic requires discourse or
creates it. Cybermind is not haunted or framed by his death, nor is it one
of those seminal / founding moments disseminated all over cyberspace - or
is it? And is there in fact a haunting? In any case, something makes one
uneasy about any reiteration of memory, and these thoughts arise again and
again as new texts or works surface, my own included, culpable and dis-
eased in their inability to absorb, efface, exhaust.

Tell us about memory, death, suture, discourse, and the tragic here.
