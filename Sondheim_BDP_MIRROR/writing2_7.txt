All this program does is take a file called ".bio" (the period keeps it 
hidden most of the time), and asks me if I want to add something to it. If 
I type "y" for "yes" it asks me to begin with a date and right a single 
line. So I could say "2001 I am getting married." and enter that. I would 
then hit the control key and "d" at the same time, and it would take the 
lines I entered and place them, in order, in the .bio file. So over time I 
can write an autobiography just by adding lines and dates.

Of course you can do this by hand, just by typing lines into an editor and 
then sorting them, but I like this odd interface.

A longer program, called Julu, is more complicated, but again took only a 
short while to write. It asks a lot of questions and returns complex texts 
I can use for writing. It has "arrays" in it, lists of words that it will 
substitute in various sentences at various times. Just to show you what it 
looks like, here is Julu (please read on; we're not learning Perl here):
