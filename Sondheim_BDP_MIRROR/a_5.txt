Core-Dump





Ruminations...two degrees of anality...retentivity, of course, all that

toilet training: _what have we here_ but the clean and proper body, pro-

tocols freely functioning, packet delivery on-time, assemblage of frag-

ments proceeding on schedule...this anal eroticism based on _closure_...

the cutting-off of the body, abjection from the body, the presence of

mucilage within the fecal matter, coherence, cohesion, language, mouth...



...listening with the anus, the other degree, the _sheave_ of the writ-

ten, emission or spew...the cloaca of cyberspace...stuttering of in-

choate letterings, the core-dump of one or another word\these memories

appear, desublimate, cathect around a complex of syllables...I must tell

you everything...



But where is this...to what purpose...if not on the level of the message

stream...leave well enough alone down there...proceed without failing...

there's still time...the datagrams properly formatted carrying this...

this _matter_ crumbling, fissuring, gleaming and lubricated from within

the interior of the id...the _it_ which is the other side of the Kris-

tevan _thing_...Heidegger's _one_ or _Man_ riding both surfaces...Unix

always _man cat_ for example...the maw of the IP address...are these

complexes, these anal openings, these core-dumps of secrets lost, expo-

sure of secret gristle, the marrow of the TCP/IP or the marrow of pass-

ing for the soul, what is this passing, the nature of the passing...

                              ???

What could write would be the _instrument of passion_... would be the

assemblage, machinic or otherwise, cam-operable, constituting the foun-

tain or ball-point pen, each with its phenomenology, the latter clogged

by the testicular (I kid you not), the former a stain upon the shaft of

the penis, quadruple roils of labia, fissured flesh and the surface of

disembodied writing, rolled up into one, core-dump or lubrication of

errors gliding past, elisions, doublings, misspellings, faulted punctua-

tions serving only to bring things to a halt, that closure again, final

as Unix _rm,_ a loss _without a doubt_...
