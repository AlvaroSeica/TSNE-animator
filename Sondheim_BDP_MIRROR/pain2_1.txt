on good days

i dream of hitler youth and grey soviet masses
i dream of nameless american troops and everywhere people marching
i dream of jagged assyrian warriors and batak sacrifices
everyone i know is deeply anonymous and wrecking
i dream of salvage and wrecking and dams holding back debris
i dream of walking in collapsed buildings and furious suicides
on good days i dream of drownings and medicated deaths
i dream police-tape barriers holding back the artifices of destruction
i dream of those artifices
on good days i dream of names in ash and broken mouths and screams
everyone i know is broken and everything is going under
on good days i dream this crime will be solved


Why I can't sleep

I begin by thinking about my being a very old man; I continue by thinking
each day might be the day where a lump or pain becomes something else,
where the body turns its course against me, and that day will be a day of
division. Or perhaps there will be a night from which there is no
awakening, and this remains deeply unimaginable. I continue by thinking
about my family relationships, how I have to permanently sever ties with
people who were dear to me, simply in order to psychically survive. This
leads to a recent article on post-traumatic stress syndrome, the obdurate
circulation of memories which become a permanent part of the psychic
landscape: something to trip over. After death they're meaningless, just

what will save us, Jennifer asks, how shall we survive, where can we turn,
what is to become of us, what is our future, what will you see when I die,
what will become of you, what will become of the species, where has our
history gone, what happens to our dust, our molecules, our atoms, what
happens to our forms, our records, our data, our speech, the recordings of
our speech, the preservation of the recordings of our speech, what happens
to the prions and viruses, the phages and the bacteria, the parasites,
what happens to our sun and our planets and our lives, to whom shall we be
speaking, how shall my mind continue without the service of a god, what
happens to our demons when our minds dissolve, corrode, decay, corrupt,
Jennifer asks, what happens when we can no longer hear your answers, can
no longer hear our answers, can no longer hear ourselves, what happens
when the memory of my mother with her book and my father with his fire,
when these are gone and the sound of the mercury light switch is gone, and
the luminous glow of the afternoon and the mighty trees are gone, and the
moon is no longer there, and the sun murmurs its planetary nebula, and the
plasma disappears and the glow disappears, and there are no eyes to see
it, no ears to hear it, and where are you among us who shall save us, oh
save me, who among us will keep their promises always based on
forfeitures, who among us will be among us, asks Jennifer, where shall I
be, what can turn me around, what can provide the loving canopy of soft
nestlings and the presence of my friends of all times and all places, what
will become of us, what will hold us back within the world of the living,
will nurture and nourish us, will feed us and clothe us, ah, I am done
for, says Jennifer, I am already half gone, I am already two-thirds gone
and three-quarters gone, ah, cries Jennifer, save me, save me, save m
