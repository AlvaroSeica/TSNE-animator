The Poem of Weeping Ghosts

I wept because I had no shoes until I dreamed a man who had a tree.
A rolling tree groped its way past stubbed branches yearning in the night.
A stitch in branches sutured the soul to its repeated self.
Give them their tired wounds yearning for repetition saving nine.
I can be led to runes; I can scoop them up.
Runes heal all wounds of selves repeated branches scraping sky.
Skies repeat skies as definitions of neurosis you can't tell to stop.
The world's neurotic with you; the world's psychotic alone.
Beneath the sun, the silent world is all there is.
Within the silent world a tree falls silently weeping.
Time makes the hearts of trees fall groping.
The weeds are always groping on the other side of the fence.
There, silently weeping, I sit shoeless on the wrong side of the tracks.
There, by Albion, silently being born.
