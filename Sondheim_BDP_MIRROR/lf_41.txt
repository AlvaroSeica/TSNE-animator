forgotten space among the objects and the margins of the screen


framework or the central division which is forgotten
places, not spaces, open elements, line segments somewhat obliterated
the spaces seething granular and seething
in the distance, a line, smooth, clear, boundary
perceptual object = let us say, what the mind tells us
the speaking of the mind through the fog of forgotten space
across the bay, along the floor of the sea, on the side of the valley
nothing wandering inscribes and the trembling of kanji into mist
forgotten space surrounding gotten space
gotten space triumphant, bounded, areas of languages and protocols
what is laying there holding somewhere what is laying there
sheets of assertion, unassigned pixels, useless waves of background color
pooling of background color, spreading around negative shapings, places
just a moment ago, about to me, something, somewhere over there
not forgotten space among the margins of the screen, a space, a screen
not thinking one into places but looking at people
others but not others, people some people
they told me about some places, the they saying, anyone saying
background inscriptions, spreading around negative propositions
places, the perhaps, main() or void, dev/null or some other placings
