             trying to come to grips with annihilation when for 
example beheading occurs, not only to foment terror, but as an 
act of piety, as part of the natural order of things -

             in the above, a signal is sent, becomes furious, 
begins to dissolve, the dance is violent and sexual like a 
machine gun

             amounting to firing a gun but now up close, the 
taste of the gristle, trophy of the severed head, or there were 
hands chopped, eyes gouged

             at times anything that can be removed

             what does this, where is a response, what is this?



ISISMACHINE

ISISMACHINE i can't do this
it doesn't come out right comes out wrong
ISIS = perfect humanism
demarcation and classification of the world
if you're not part of the answer you're part of the problem
anyone can use the slogan ISIS = mathesis
i am an arm of the equation i can't do this
why are you not seeing new ISIS philosophy
there's none other = ISIS exists
too many endgames at play 
too many games the war machine ISISMACHINE is machine
is machine broken is perfect machine
art-philosophy machine sex machine i can't do this
i can't do this i just can't do this



ISISTHEY keep on coming

_the they._ _the they_ mask. _the they_ masquerade.
already forced into a vanishing of alterity. already _they_ won.
already he won. already leaders. already led.
the violence of _the they._ the violence of a leader.
_they_ buy us into _their_ myth. _they_ caress us.
_our_ myth.

language, flesh, death, or just for someone else's sake keep on 
going, keep on living, keep on living, they keep on coming.  
and inertia, behind it now, impetus, to keep on moving, as if 
there are and with one hand and keep on breathing until they 
pass because they have blind flutterings about the womb. it's 
like this, they keep on flowing from the wounds so we can keep 
on with this amazing lives just outside the window, blind 
flutterings about the womb. you decide hope manage find some 
peace doing it, keep on, keep on living. we've got that and they 
keep on coming, keep on going, i'm afraid i have to keep on 
living in this hated world - you'd have to keep on living, deal 
with them - so they don't fall down, they keep on moving - so 
you don't fall down, you keep on moving - blind flutterings 
about the womb

he's going to keep on going, they keep on flowing from the 
wounds so i hold on - all that remains imminent, perhaps less, 
unresonant, so i keep on them, and those walls keep on crackling 
and the light keeps coming through, than that which you've 
already found, you have to keep on, keep on flowing from the 
wounds you decide hope manage find some peace doing it, keep on 
already across cliffs unafraid 2 fall & get up again and keep 
on, they keep on coming, they keep on coming, _they_ keep on

"The end approaches, now it's too late to tell the truth about 
the apocalypse. But what are you doing, all of you will still 
insist, to what ends do you want to come when you come to tell 
us, here now, let's go, come, the apocalypse, it's finished, I 
tell you this, that's what's happening."
