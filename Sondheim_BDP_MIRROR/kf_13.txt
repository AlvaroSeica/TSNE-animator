when the screen goes blank
there's a dead eye in the middle of the world
i'd almost said word
i'd almost written world
but there's a dead eye
i'm so used to the i's
the hand trembles and doesn't cease
the hand keeps going
in the middle of the word
i almost said word
in the middle of the written world
there's the black "fire of dead ice"
i can't imagine you when i can't read you
i almost said you
blanking the trembling hand
