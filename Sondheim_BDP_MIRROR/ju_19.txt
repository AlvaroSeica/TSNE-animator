Jennifer and Julu


Jennifer and Julu, their consecration to be announced to one another,
quietly passing flowers to one another, the thin ghosts thought now of the
time of melding and rumors, talked only in whispers, at night. 

Like an arrow or pivot in the wayward moonlit sky, the sheer spear-hawk
fell in a thin swoop upon the shadows nearby. Small luminous elk and deer
chased animals scurrying through the black and tangled underbrush; owl
shrieked nearby. It was as if rain melted like black snow, dark Julu fell
soon asleep, or so she thought. Still, it was night and hallucination, and
Jennifer, carrying a singular candle with a long, tapering flame wore a
long brocaded gown; Julu, never looking so beautiful in her life, uneasily
lay down to rest. Jennifer's diagnosis was that it could have been the
brilliant jewels of the tourmaline imaginary. 

Somewhere absolute negation reigned without attribution; I sought this in
the depths of the operating system itself, knowing that Julu didn't
recover from the mining catastrophe. I was surprised that, seemingly, she
would have known the transformation she had occasioned near the end of
this record.
