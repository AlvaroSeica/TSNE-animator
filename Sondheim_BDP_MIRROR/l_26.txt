i worked on the editing a long time, sent it to Kim. i took out most of 
the explicit references; the churning of language, which was real-time 
from the screen, was the result of simultaneous typing. so there's 
another buried text, that of the explicit references, narrative, and 
would that ground the Other? and is that always the case...

(saying something about the signifier/signified, tethering at this 
juncture: as if proper names, signatures, were the horizon of each and 
every discourse.)

and it's this Other/text that reveals, inverts the body, presents no 
substitutions...
