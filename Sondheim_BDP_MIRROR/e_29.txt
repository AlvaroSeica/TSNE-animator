all the words I could ever say on the blue screen on the green screen
all the words to whisper among us in the red letters in the blue letters
the green screen the dream screen blue as the sky is blue
the blue screen the dark screen red letters screamed in lightning
or the red letters screamed in thunder or the letters wrapped around us

all the words I'd write if I could write on screen in the screen 
if I could write upon the screen against the screen,

the comma dividing _this_ from every other breath,

surrounding intertwining implicate implicated interpenetrated, words 
stumbling across bodies creased by crossed language, crescent moon
holds us Violette spiked within the curtailment of the fold fata morgana
that fatal morning interpenetrating lassitude of that day 
of the moon-stalked sun, the world had teeth
