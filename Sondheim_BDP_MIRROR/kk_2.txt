Prometheus


I want to reach a conclusion to these texts.  
Then I wouldn't have to write again, think again, or rather
that everything thought would be on the order of commentary.
As it is, I start from scratch, scratch myself, and a text emerges
which comments one way or another on a disarray so deep
that it becomes impossible to theorize, that is, a disarray
so shallow, that it rides foam-like on the surface of theory,
hustling the oxygen below.
I want to reach a conclusion to the texts, but as soon
as I begin, this-way or that-way, Nikuko perhaps will take over,
or Alan, or Julu, and I remain at a loss, thinking
it's all a form of chic seduction, it's always a lure and relaxation,
there are no two ways about it, there are many more, irreducible
to one way or another. 
There is a work _iki_ which describes this well, you can find out
more about _iki_ in Kuki Shuzo's Reflections on Japanese Taste,
The Structure of _iki,_ which leaves one trailing off again and again
across the nature of this or that kimono pattern or musical scale.
Certainly, Nikuko comes out of courtesan-iki-from-the-Edo-period,
but the analysis in fact is quite chic itself, and up-to-date,
since there is never a giving in, how could there be in text
or cyberspace? There's only a movement or a fluttering
of a fan or shimmering of the leaves of manga-with-girls-and-boys
read on the shinkansen, but I don't want to escape my native /
land, so I will give an example of a soccer ball poised precisely
in one frame of one game of the World Cup, sent anonymously
to a fashion magazine in New York's SOHO district -
and you can see that this is no answer at all, not even a question
of previous or next
only what might be considered a _meteorology,_
meteorological moment,
when anything might happen, rain or not forecast in the vicinity.
So to want to reach a conclusion is similar
to reaching for a book
or the space between the second and third line of a haiku
or between the twelfth and thirteenth line of a sonnet
or between the hard drive and the head
where the drive's gone, couplet's gone, line's gone
walking invisible and stemming the tide in the middle of SOHO
where you might find people turning around to look at you
if you continue to behave in this fashion,
I know I would.
