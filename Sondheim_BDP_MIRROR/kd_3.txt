CYBERSHINTO !!!


Think! Think! Think!

Cyber-Shinto, marriage of the Electronic Chip and the National Treas-
ure Ginko Tree! Cyber-Shinto in All things! Cyber-Shinto, Live and Let
Live!

Cyber-Shinto: It was bound to happen! Forget the Seven Happy Gods,
        think of _yao-yoruzu no kami,_ "ever-increasing myriad
        deities, each a Node on the Network, the Virtual Spiritual-
        Real of all things. Make up your prays, sublimations, dis-
        course as you go along - it's not a return to Tribality so
        much as an entrance to post-animism spirituality.
Cyber-Shinto: Kami, kami, kami!
Cyber-Shinto: That this World Isn't All there is, that one goes
        beyond, Beyond!
Cyber-Shinto: Celebration of Life, not Death! Leave the funerals to
        the Buddhists!
Cyber-Shinto: Instead of Heavenly or Earthly Gods, think of Presences
        on the Net: _so far,_ one has a sense of turning away from
        the computer Screen - HERE, it's virtual - THERE, it's real!
        _So far,_ there is still a distinction to be made.
Cyber-Shinto: In which the kamidana, household altar, becomes the
        computer, and the computer becomes the kamidana! Still, it's
        a Thing in the room, something approached or withdrawn-from -
        but for _how long?_
Cyber-Shinto: Where the ceremony to summon kami, kamimukae, becomes
        the Entrance to Cyberspace (Forget Nationism!), burgeoning
        of Communities of Avatars, excellence in all things! Think
        of this as the TCP/IP _protocols of the faith,_ regulating
        Entrance and Exit! (Forget Emperors, Leaders, Men, Women,
        Gurus, Avatars!)
Cyber-Shinto: For neo-animisms and spiritualities work excellently
        in Technological Society - breakdowns of Grand Narratives
        (forget the Kojiki or Nihongi!), spread of micro-electronics,
        nanotechnologies and miniaturized interpenetrating Virtual
        Worlds (the garage-door microchip! telephone! ankle-guard!).
Cyber-Shinto, now _Cybershinto:_ Think of kamiokuri, the ceremony
        of sending-off kami after kamimukae, releasing the Virtual,
        turning off the Speaking-Machine: "IT IS NOW SAFE TO LEAVE
        THE KAMI, TURN OFF THE COMPUTER!" But for _how long_ will
        there be this distinction, before Perfect Merging, here
        and now?
Cybershinto: The computer is the shintai, object of worship contain-
        ing kami. Shinto: Way of the Kami. Cybershinto: Way of the
        Virtual, indeed!
Cybershinto: The carrying-palanquin for the kami, moving from
        shrine to street, dispersed among the nodes - the mikoshi,
        carried by protocols across cyberspace, whole worlds of
        kami! (Often translated as portable shrine, but think of
        as a _vector_ from node to node, fiber-optic ultimate band-
        width of the Real!)
Cybershinto: Mikoto, words or commands of a god or noble, for ex-
        ample: WHAT ARE YOU SAYING OVER THE WIRES? WHO IS LISTEN-
        ING? WHO CARRIES THE SONGS? TO WHOM DOES YOUR HEART BELONG?
Cybershinto: Ah, tana or spirit / soul, in Everything that Lives!
        Tana across the Wires, Tana of the Wires! For the Wires are
        Everywhere; we are Turning, not towards Tribalism, but to-
        wards the Virtual in All Things!
Cybershinto: not National Shinto, Shrine Shinto, Traditional Shin-
        tos, but the Wired Shinto of the Future Technological
        State, the Perfect Innuendo, Perfect Harmony!
Cybershinto: "Networks are inherently decentralizing and anti-hi-
        erarchical." (Wired magazine, January 1998.)
Cybershinto: "We live in a MEDIATED world." (Wired magazine, Janu-
        ary, 1998.)
Cybershinto: "Pierre Teilhard de Chardin prophesied 50 years ago
        that an electronic membrane covering the earth would wire
        all humanity together in a single nervous system." (Wired
        magazine, January, 1998.)
Cybershinto: "We stand on the verge of being able to change the
        human race." (Wired magazine, January, 1998.)
Cybershinto: "THE FUTURE IS IN BETA." (Wired magazine, January,
        1998.)
CYBERSHINTO!!!
