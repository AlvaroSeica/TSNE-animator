urge


did i say dissemination? darwin's dis/ease. i'm too smart, too aware i'm 
writing just to continue, assert presence, inscribe. place my mark like 
every other smart little boy and girl. graffiti the indefinite walls of 
cyberspace. what i say is irrelevant. it's all in the action, spraying 
this, that, every other site, building up recognition capital on google.

i want to escape my genes. i can't meditate for more than thirty seconds. 
my shakuhachi playing lasts a couple of minutes and i'm on to something 
else. i have to leave my mark everywhere. i recognize the compulsion. i 
write about the compulsion and against the compulsion. 

i'd like to see bush dead. his compulsion ruins the world. i see my ugly 
face reflected in his ugly face. i scrawl here; he scrawls there. i scrawl 
virtual; he scrawls real. maybe he even thinks about it.

if i don't spray nightly, i'm lost. my body turns against me; my dreams 
become nightmares worse than usual, endless, vicious. the flesh deflates, 
potency gone; the mind evaporates. i'm aware of the illness. i can 
deconstruct the illness. i can work through it and the illness is at the 
other end.

the illness is our illness. 

contrary to belief, there are no borders to the blog, just boarders. there 
are borders on the list. one comes up against another. one response is 
always out of control of the other. list territory is psychological 
territory, a wager. it is a wager of the real, not of the virtual, but in 
the virtual.

it is useless at this end, my end. every publication is another brick, 
another ward against death. the recordings, books, videos, anthologies, 
magazines, tapes, dvds, cdroms, pile up like debris. i look on one side 
and see nothing. i look over to the other side; there's nothing there.

there's the urge and it pushes. it mixes with wonder which is perhaps its 
excuse or perhaps what's left of a humanity i want to hold to. but the 
urge is a sickness, the sickness of a mad species, a mad specimen, the 
madness of the obsessive individual. write or die.

years ago i had up on the wall: i write myself into existence. i write 
myself out of existence. the inscription is all there is. the inscription 
gives me the fairy-tale, the fantasy, fantasm, imaginary, image, of 
survival after death. of promulgation ad infinitum. of gene-pools no 
longer at the mercy of the flesh. 

this is my politics. it is probably everyone's. we take positions, 
backwards and forwards, of withdrawal as well. meditation is a position as 
rigid as others. we hold to them. we work with them, work towards them. 
we're genetically driven. we're tagging everything in site. we're tagging 
everyone and every other. we're tagging the planet, we're sprawl/scrawl.

there's false joy in this. i'm aware of the falseness, crash constantly. i 
write another, yet another piece. 'artist' is an excuse for tagging of 
every kind, out of control, unstructured, desperate. tagging is an excuse 
for inscription, leaving genetic debris, named or anonymous, but always 
named, everywhere in sight, in site, in cite. the wonder follows, fallow.

bush kills, bushwhacks. we are responsible for millions of tiny murders, 
day by day. powerless, we do the same. every letter is a violence, 
occupies space, defends itself, within and without spell-check. it's the 
urge. i know it and can't fight it. we're talking, scrawling, unto death. 

the light that can be seen and can't be named: the brain shutting down, 
just before everything goes black. we'll all be there, emptied out. we're 
gone before we started.

what i remember

jodee talking about having a child and she would not want to hurt it and 
wouldn't hurt it and it would love her and she would love it.
banging my body into my body symmetrically and naked, talking hysteria.
diseased and gynecological closeups jumping off the digital/analog page, 
as if in a row of equivalences.
constant crossings of the border beneath the bridge where the river 
divided the nations and there was also the possibility of gangs, bullets, 
and gold.
jodee pouring water in my ear, frantic laughter, tied up and no one cared.
lack of caring crashing the body against itself repeatedly as below.
as below, so above.
dental plans not offered at the maquiladora manufacturing wheelchairs.
the song of the little boys and little girls against the abstracted 
backdrop of transformed feedback continents pulsing and en-tranced.
touching kathy acker wrong and furious at collapsing walls.
emily cheng leaning back tired and talking it was normal.
then of the colonias unbounded, electric dragged from the wires with 
wires, water trucks churning through the mud, shortwave spy stations uno 
uno tres quatro tres.
hating memories, baiting and breaking tapes into rearrangement tapes and 
the extreme angle screaming for doctor doctor in sinecure display.
proc amp configurations, ntsc safety zones, colorbars and waveform 
monitors, watching the splayed and self-loathed body repeatedly crash.
the crawl and scrawl of it.
the sprawl.

Freedom's just another word for some place to abuse.

I can't stand it at this point. This is rant. I'm sick and tired of 
debates. I'm sick and tired of hair-splitting. I find myself hating the 
word 'Christian' and everything it stands for. We Jews should have killed 
ourselves off; instead, we channeled virulent monotheisms of all stripes, 
holocausts without number. We let others do it and do it to us. We do it 
to ourselves and others. I hate the word 'pro-life' and everything it 
stands for - while children around the world are starving and it's going 
to get worse. I'm tired of reasoning against the monolith. Most of all I 
hate the word 'freedom' which is a dirty word for everything we want to do 
around the world. 'Freedom fries'? You bet - it exposes our intolerance of 
anyone daring to disagree with us.

I've been using the word 'fascism' recently; I've always avoided it the 
past. I see our situation similar to Karl Kraus' - including the weakening 
of the dollar, new levels of mass communication and discourse networks, 
silent organizations of disparate groups like the Freikorps into a 
right-wing mass. Don't take it seriously! Satire works wonders. I find 
Bush a blunt ideologue, one whose violence will ultimately take the world 
down. If not Bush, someone else, but the guise is the same, and as mass 
communications and populations increase, others equally or far more 
violent will come along. Fundamentalisms of all sorts can only take over 
in a world of such leaky information flow that the poor are sent to the 
Pale, unrepresented, polluted. If I were Pale-poor I would join my masters 
to fight their masters. O the righteous fight.

Simulacra return with a vengeance in the face of weapons of mass 
destruction - and you know what? These weapons smash ontology in the face. 
No longer the world of everyday things - but the world of silent, 
invisible, and absent killers, hidden regimes of information, nuclear and 
other radiations, invisible viral plagues - all plasma, seepage - what 
I've been on about for years. Give me a medal.

I can't master my hatred. I turn it against myself. It's so good for you. 
I'm harmless. I'll eat my own flesh. But let me ask you: If you could kill 
a world leader - without repercussion - anyone you found criminal or 
ultra-violent, a Bin Laden or Hussein - if you could do this without any 
recrimination, as if by magic, would you? Would you pray for the death of 
a criminal if you believed in prayer?

If a criminal and a leader were one and they were prayed to death, I sure 
wouldn't want to make an example of them because then we'd have another 
Christ to contend with. One, two, a million, Christs, Meshiachs, Messiahs, 
Holinesses, grave-diggers, grave-robbers, undead all. Deliverance of 
kindness ends up at the wrong end of a gun.

The Christ of the sermon-mount has all but disappeared. Whatever happened 
to liberation theology? Marx and decon are now dirty words and sooner or 
later someone will bring up Jew Derrida, Jew Levi-Strauss, all those 
intellectuals, and the problems they made for Jew-Marx, Lyotard, 
Heidegger, all those others. Return of the killers, killers back at you. 
We're there waiting for them. We'll contribute with the book, one, two, a 
million books. We'll theorize them to hell and back. We'll show them. 
We'll show them pictures.

We'll talk that forbidden subject, biology. We'll ignore the hatreds, 
poisons, in our systems, our genetic cess-pools, our desire repeatedly to 
bring the world down around us for a filthy grasp at heaven. We'll stab 
science in the back as intelligence creationism and arguments about 
life-tissue send the world environment teetering towards extinction of 
pretty much everything around us. Not much time till armageddon (without 
capital), slow and dirty.

You can't argue with biology, man. You can't argue with biology, baby.

Who twists our necks? 
We twist our necks.
Who twists our necks?
We twist our necks.

Freedom's just another word for someone to abuse.

Please read, Abstention

I apologize for this note, but feel it's necessary. I've been carrying around 
too much anger recently; this is also true of most of my offline friends. Anger 
leads to despair, disgust, internal violence. I'm not good at meditating and/or 
drugs; my outlets are my work and of course discourse online. But the latter 
has become increasingly acerbic on my part, for no reason, especially among 
people I respect. I feel I should abstain from discussion at this point; I'm 
too out of control. Unfortunately for those of you who find my work spam, I'll 
continue to send it out. But beyond that, I'll try silence as much as possible.

The election of Bush, our personal lack of money, my own lack of a future in 
the job market (equivalent to a very real lack of a future), all of these 
things weigh - not to mention constant insomnia, headaches, stress, problems 
with my family. I've been going through the roof, getting up in tears in the 
morning. It's not fair to Azure, and not to myself for that matter, although I 
don't know how to stop it. But at least I don't need to inflict myself on 
people here, online.

I try to keep the rage and despair out of my work. I've been looking at
older work over the past few days, and it feels suicidal. It's hard to
face, but I'm trying to put at least some of it on DVDs, out of
deteriorating VHS, 8mm, and Hi8mm tapes. The sound pops out, tracking is
lost, and all the usual shifts are occurring that happen in analog. In any
case, I'm dismayed at the self-loathing within a number of them, and
trying to come to grips with that.

For the rest, I feel my work is on course as usual, whatever that may be.
But I've noted my too-fast responses online - and that serves no useful
purpose, for you or for myself.

I hope to be back in discussion mode soon and please don't take this the
wrong way, whatever that might be.

- Alan

"political shadows," by alan sondheim


http://www.asondheim.org/wtc1.jpg
http://www.asondheim.org/wtc2.jpg
http://www.asondheim.org/wtc3.jpg

images modified from database but the shadows are there, too dark to be 
real, too ominous, of older materials, satellites and aeroships doing 
their work.

of reworking, inteference, as if to make them my own, invisible and 
impossible copyright materials i would assume.

but of interest for screen saver, and thinking-piece.

then of course updating of kiev.mov at both sites:

http://www.asondheim.org/kiev.mov
http://www.as.wvu.edu:8000/clc/Members/sondheim/kiev.mov

something to think about and it is still happening. 

question for study, what do we see?

why did the elephant pack a trunk? because his nose was broken.
past all acceleration the hyperaccelerator brings particles to fruition.
why was the giraffe a foot? because he was looking for food.
why did the pangolin weigh himself? because he carried his own scales.
why did the beetle play guitar? because she was one of the beatles.
why did the swordfish dual? because there were two of them.
why did the bullfrog die? because he croaked.
why did the flamingo have a leg up on the competition? because she 
couldn't stand it. why didn't the cricket play baseball? because he 
played cricket. why wasn't the horse blind? because she was a sea-horse.
why did the ant attack the grasshopper? so he would cry uncle.

why was the kaon manic-depressive? because she broke the laws of symmetry.

   pity, brings him food now and then, he's losing weight, has a gaunt
   look, his dreams stopped a long time ago, sometimes he writes poetry,
   badly in need of sleep, studying for the examinations, they come up 
   in spring, his parents send him what they can, he's crying, if they
   only knew how he lived, how useless their sacrifices, he's unworthy,
   unworthy...

the big explosion

you will know the big explosion because you won't hear from me again.
but you won't be looking, will you? you'll be busy with other things.
or you won't be able to see or hear and i'd be the last thing on your 
 mind.
why am i saying this? so you'll remember now, something else to forget
 when the big explosion comes.
you've already forgotten this, haven't you?
perhaps the big explosion has already come.

i will find some of you there.
i am poison jew. arab-hating jew.
i kill christians. i kill christ.
i spit on your children.
i slaughter your children.
the world is all about me:
 1. it surrounds me.
 2. read the protocols of zion.
israel should be destroyed utterly.
the united states should be destroyed utterly.
i am poison proud zionist. 
i will take you with me.
i believe in god. 
arabs smell like the jews smell.
you can't clean a semite off a semite.
the best you can do is give it a gun.
jews are the worst people of all.
it is our secret how bad we are.
we whisper it to each other.
jews kill children and old people.
they didn't like to waste their bullets they said.
it is my sickness to be a jew. 
i should be destroyed.
it is better to kill than to think. 
it is better to kill quickly.
jews have that thing about them. 
you know what it is.
it's whispered we will bring the world down with us.
today is the first night of chanukah and we are bent on destruction.
i announce it proudly: we will destroy you all.
