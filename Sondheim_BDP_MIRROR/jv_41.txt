World-Fragment

The blush of the world unfolded itself in the pink of the text.
Luscious pink petals leaned against the blackness of the nighttime screen.
In the distance, P J Harvey played her jagged mushy tunes.
Skin flushed, the woman dressed in black turned restlessly on-screen.
A hushed sound filled the room as Penny Jennifer tried to speak.
"I crushed no one," she screamed through the glass screen ceiling.
The flush of a toilet cut off the room's angry unsettled replies.
Penny J pushed the monitor, toppling the men watching through the floor.
P Jennifer rearranged her severe clothing, somehow plush and sheer.
She was bushed, tensed and limbs exposed, shuddering to nervous halt.
The screen rushed towards pure absence on both sides of the border.
She gushed, "The world's blush unfolding in the textual, fleshy pink."
