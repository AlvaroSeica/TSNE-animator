[14:49] Julu Twine: i'm not sleeping i'm awake in mourning
[14:50] Julu Twine: not body parts in space, particles
[14:54] Alan Dojoji: a deathmask i sdancing and a hanged man is hanging
[14:54] Julu Twine: deathmask of particles and hanging from strings
[14:55] Alan Dojoji: the purple legs of a dangling dancer, hanged
[14:56] Julu Twine: flooding the world, exasperated for organism
[14:56] Alan Dojoji: a thin mask, suspended insoluble
[14:57] Julu Twine: falling and cluttered among themselves...
[14:57] Alan Dojoji: clinging, clattering, clanging, dangling
[14:58] Julu Twine: fluttered, the body hugs the body, caressing itself
[14:58] Alan Dojoji: your words knock mine askew, i forget my bearings
[14:59] Julu Twine: the world is always fallen
[14:59] Alan Dojoji: i had a mind to... never mind, the thought has 
drifted and hangs motionless
[15:00] Julu Twine: mind drifts from mind, drifts from body, thought 
coagulates
[15:00] Alan Dojoji: so hard to hold on, hold on
[15:01] Julu Twine: thought clusters
[15:01] Alan Dojoji: now the sphere comes into view, but obscurely
[15:01] Julu Twine: and night falls in the dark kingdom...

[15:06] Julu Twine: THICK. THE NIGHT. ANGELS.
[15:07] Alan Dojoji: the light is falling across his motionless legs
[15:07] Julu Twine: STARS BURN EYES: SILENCING THE DARK
[15:08] Alan Dojoji: her head is upside down in the heavy darkness
[15:08] Julu Twine: INERT: HE IS HER THUD
[15:08] Alan Dojoji: i wander among a torrent of body parts
[15:09] Julu Twine: BELONGED
[15:09] Alan Dojoji: he drifts on a raft of human bones
[15:09] Julu Twine: TRAVESTY < LENGTHWISE < PARALLEL FLESH
[15:10] Alan Dojoji: she sits on the stoop in twilight zones
[15:10] Julu Twine: HE STOOPS. IS HER LADDER. STONE.
[15:11] Alan Dojoji: her skull peculiarly elongated, her funny moans
[15:11] Julu Twine: HIS MOANS.
[15:12] Alan Dojoji: she tunes in vaguely to his static stooping
[15:12] Julu Twine: NO RESPONSE. GRANITE. THICK.
[15:13] Alan Dojoji: something drifts through the slats of the stoop and 
the raft, affect?
[15:13] Julu Twine: THIRD STAIR FROM THE BOTTOM. IS HIM.
[15:13] Alan Dojoji: a sluggish rhythm, his tithe to her
[15:14] Julu Twine: HIS THICKNESS. FURROWED. TRAPPED THOUGHT.
[15:14] Alan Dojoji: a cleft, a ravine, she is a window resting on a 
shattered pane
[15:14] Julu Twine: HE SHATTERS.
[15:15] Alan Dojoji: she offers no safe haven, he's adrift
[15:15] Julu Twine: HE SHATTERS.
[15:16] Alan Dojoji: she is migratory, mutable, reflective
[15:16] Julu Twine: HE SHATTERS. THICK. HE SHATTERS.

Humo kupliaku natho humo tokiyo /now the eagle is made now 

I released the bomb like an eagle with great-talons
I released the bomb like an eagle with great-talons

I released the bomb like an eagle with great-talons, says N
it's like an eagle in the sky,
o knot of soldiers, I released the bomb like an eagle with great-talons,

I released the bomb like an eagle with great-talons
I released the bomb like an eagle with great-talons

i released the bomb like an eagle with great-talons, says N, people. i am 
an eagle and i am powerful and fly higher than any other or no people. i 
am not an eagle and i am not powerful and fly higher. what's that eagle 
going to do? he's going to fly, him. but you put a falcon nor osprey, 
eagle or mountebank crow, not the hurricane or the eagle which is the 
harbinger of truth, /* but an eagle on the peak */, not the hurricane or 
the eagle which is the harbinger of truth, /* but like an eagle on the 
peak */


interference, disappear, cleansed, gone

just before i got this -
[15:22]  Zodial Semple shouts: That's what Odyessey if for! Please stop
building your "art" on my skyline!
then took the stuff down.

four small songs of death 

harbor 1,2,3,4 four small songs of death and coming to grace unto death
and of that coming to grace, meandering and grasping still and hovering
among deaths and holdings on and releasings,
recapitulation, of the first three small songs of death, before the fourth
of which there is no recapitulation or releasing, no holding on, descent
among them all, of their descent, and of their desire to die, desire
among them

Clarksberg

as if it were Clarksberg 1942.
as if there were a large 'oriental' population in Clarksberg.
as if they were a 'swarthy' hebrew-speaking 'race.'
as if they played the 'sad mournful melodies of their people.'
as if there were a wire recorder and an eager collector.
as if he asked my father to demonstrate his 'unusual instrument.'
as if my father obliged.
as if he always obliged.
as if he sat on the edge of the cabin porch.
as if he leaned forward and tuned his 'unusual instrument.'
as if he began to play.
as if the wind picked up.
as if he played the 'eerie minor keys of his people.'
as if he played the 'ancient tunes' remembered 'from his childhood.'
as if he looked sad and thoughtful.
as if he'd stop now and then and listen to the wind.
as if you were in Clarksberg 1942.
as if you listened in the wind.

azure: 'death is a symptom not a disease.'

tonight i think: romanticism is a disease of death, not its symptom. my 
thoughts crawl like maggots cleansing the brain of life. i release them, 
they release themselves, don't go there. what descends is the violence and 
fury of decay, the curtain that ceases on details, enlarges them until 
memory collapses under the weight of futility. at the bottom of the social 
lies the ash-heap, festering for a limited time at best. every statement 
at heart desires life, protocol, exactitude, as if something were 
accomplished, the world hammered back into shape. the secret of writing, 
every statement mauls itself. i am a sensitive. i cannot forbear this as 
human condition's nuance. but forbearance is swept away as well. this is 
both the same old story and the only one. social networks collapse, it's 
not one's life that fleshes before one's eyes, but the diminution, hacking 
away, of the social. nothing is left but the flash which exits with a 
thud. it's the failure of philosophy not to undermine itself this way, no 
matter how weak, weak theory appears, no matter how many subjunctives, 
it's gone before it arrives, nothing can revive it. already deconstruction 
deconstructs nothing, becomes a distraught capsule of its own unraveling. 
the existentialist project is its own formal reversal, phenomenology 
talking the red patch or the computer screen's dull eye. every example is 
a confounded, entangled, others. ours is a species listing to one side, 
close to the breaking-point, intent on closure with insufficient time, 
what crawls on my brain, what fleshes, crawls on yours as well, worlds 
enough, unkempt detail, peripheral coagulations resisting the logical 
light of day. the world goes away before it arrives, the world has gone 
away before it arrived. it announces nothing and our anthropomorphic vault 
has already crashed. death is a symptom of the omen of death, every set is 
open, already foreclosed. what crawls in my mind will kill my sanity, the 
presumption is that the rest of us have more than enough to spare. the 
sane are masquerades, the insane cannot lift a stone verb. in between, 
mobsters appear, what's left is the spoils. nothing moves as feynmann 
diagrams shudder indefinitely, spoils seethe. unwatched, we're gone, 
carelessly it moves.
