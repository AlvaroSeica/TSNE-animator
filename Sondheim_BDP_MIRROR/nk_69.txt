changes in performance

right now i have continuous dialog screen bottom + audio video sound
running

1 text running w/ different background color in front of full-screen image
directory series?

2 automated text running in the same position

3 double automated text the same

use bump mapping w/other images if possible

4 speak about setting things in motion etc. etc.

'this is a sign of the future"
'in the future all things will be arranged"

'he's already shown this to a lot of people"

'they won't believe he's working on something new"

'they won't believe in him"

with abject apologies
"what a performance failure" 
"no one is running this"
"he'll move the text in a minute"

with shakuhachi live maybe
"he wants to practice shakuhachi"
"he'll share these notes with anyone who want to read them"

with bows and graceful feelings
"how generous he is"

"how much love'

"we read his innermost thoughts in 'changes in performance''

"how clever how clever'

"something detracts us from death'

"how clever how clever'

(codework and conflation)


I want to briefly mention another related approach, which I've touched on
- something I developed in the 70s - the notion of interlocking
'hierarchies' which are actually tangled - an 'immersive' and a
'definable.'

The 'definable' follows the laws of everyday life, including aristotelian
logic and its classical laws of distribution. This logic is the logic of
everyday life, the logic of concrete physical objects in the world -
books, cups, etc. Objects are discrete, more or less retain their form,
can be moved from location to location and back again. We depend on this
logic for our everyday activities - if we take a subway somewhere, we
depend on being able to take it back again.

In this logic, if A -> B, we might assume that B -> A. Move a book to a
shelf, remove it, put it back. The hierarchy emerges as follows.
(book to shelf) -> (book from shelf)
((book to shelf) -> (book from shelf)) -> ((book from shelf) ->
   (book to shelf))
and so forth. One starts constructing graphs with equivalent and
reversible states.

Now in the analysis above, I've typed the grouping from "In this logic"
... to "reversible states." This is the experiential level - and I'm
working on a secondary experiential level here. The _subject_ of the
experiential level is the book/shelf transform - say T(b/s). This is the
level of phenomenology which is temporally-bound.

Of course T(b/s) is temporally bound, but reversible. It's aligned and
allied to a non-temporal mathematics or mathematical logic. Once the world
enters into the equation, once time becomes an _intrinsic_ part of things,
the world is different, susceptible to organism among other things.

So say that T(b/s) is a reversible formalism, but that the world of
organism and experience encompasses and inheres to time. This analysis is
necessarily fuzzy (is the book really on the shelf? what if the shelf
falls? what does the book do if it's "half on/half off" etc.?) In fact,
Bohm's implicate order appears everywhere in the real world.

So for example given T(2,2) -> 4, on a formal level then T'(T(2,2) -> 4)
-> (4 -> T(2,2)) and so forth, but the _act of inscription_ inheres to
time, is subject to phenomenological analysis, and, in relation to
organism, implicates desire, apparatus, culture, community, economics, and
so forth. It is here that the 'dirtiness' of codework appears - the
relationship of consciousness to formal systems within a somewhat muddied
hierarchy involving mathematics, logics, the formalism of the classical
lifeworld, and so forth. Codework _as a whole_ presents its object and the
inscription of its object, both taken in the broadest sense; it can
present, for example, a range from the _political economy of the sign_ to
the presumption of abstracted, classical, pure, and 'perfect' symbologies,
sememes, and sign systems.

Codework takes into account that the bookshelf is old, dusty, perhaps
slippery - that the book might well be lost or forgotten there, might
decay there, etc.

Once this rough scheme is in place, it's easy to see that the
reversibility of definable models is counteracted by the implicit
irreversibility of the experiential. Within the experiential, 2 + 2 d
equals 4, but this is a _process_ (both Whitehead's analysis and
intuitionism come to mind here). One might argue that the process involves
issues of genidentity (see Reichenbach) and equivalence - but this gets us
fairly far afield.

In this regard codeworks take into account the act and process of reading
- another conflation, between the presumptive ideality of code and the
responsive organism.

It should be noted in this regard that somewhere, I believe, Heinz von
Foerster characterizes organism in terms of negation - an organism is
something that can _swerve_ or _avoid_ something in the environment - for
example, protists swimming away from a localized patch of polluted water.
An organism can actively _negate_ and discriminate among stimuli. Of
course, even a simple robot can do this, not to mention x- phobic or
-philic molecules.

The interesting thing about von Foerster's characterization is that
codework _in a sense_ underlies organism itself, since negation is an
uneasy logical operator that has been temporalized in the construction of
a world.

In other words, codework is a conflation of temporal processes and spatial
production; of material existence and theoretical idealities; all within
the aegis of consciousness. The political economy of codework is the
struggle for communication itself; its phenomenology is the relation of
consciousness to system and structure; and its form is wide-ranging among
genre and media. Perhaps its main characterization is the messiness of
cross-epistemological and cross-ontological praxis, both of which underlie
mind - human and otherwise - in the world.

BOOKS I LIKE - some reviews of books I've been reading and using:


Degunking Windows, Joli Ballew and Jeff Duntemann, Paraglyph Press, 2004 . 
I use both WinXP and Linux for multimedia work; recently, I've also been 
using an old Win98 machine which I put on the network here (DSL + WiFi). I 
recently wrote for, and received, a review copy of Degunking Windows - and 
can luckily recommend this completely. It's absolutely necessary for 
anyone running XP. The user level is Novice to Intermediate, which means 
it's just about for everyone who is unused to playing with the Windows 
system. 

Windows XP is somewhat of a mess; there are temporary files all over the 
place, things that don't work particularly well, animations and other 
"effects" that consume resources and slow the system up, duplicate and 
other key problems in the registry (which contains information on just how 
the system is supposed to run), and so forth. Since I'm using a laptop 
which is all of two years old, and since I do almost all my sound/video 
editing on it (as well as live performance), I need to have Windows 
running as lean and fast as possible - I also need it _not_ to crash in 
the middle of a production!

Degunking Windows is perfect in this regard, especially if you don't have,
for example, TweakUI and other tools already at your disposal. Even though
I'm in the advanced user category (I hope by now!), I found a number of
useful suggestions; by the time I was done, I had increased my freespace
(on a 30 gigabyte drive) from 10.2 to 15.8 gigabytes. This, coupled with
my recent use of GNU software tools in the terminal ("console") window,
has sped up my production work considerably, from video rendering to text
manipulation. I highly recommend this book to _anyone_ with WinXP, 
especially if you're using your computer for more than email and surfing 
(although there are good sections on both as well).

Linux in a Nutshell, A Desktop Quick Reference, 4th edition, Ellen Siever,
Stephen Figgins, and Aaron Weber, O'Reilly, 2003 . Well, this is now
enormous, over 900 pages long, which gives a good indication of the growth
of Linux. At one point, I would have recommended this to beginners - at
this point, it's better for intermediate or advanced users, I think, who
would need the full set of commands (and it's not even that!), with their
options. It covers the KDE and Gnome desktops; RCS and CVS for project 
control; there are sections on bash and tcsh, on sed and gawk and vi and 
its varieties and Emacs, etc. etc. It's still an amazingly quick lookup 
when you need something in a hurry.

Speaking of which, I've now been using Fedora from RedHat, problem free, 
for quite a while. I would switch fully to linux, but it's terrible for 
multimedia video applications, relatively poor for sound as well. There's 
no Quicktime for linux, except a version which runs Quicktime uncompressed 
- which isn't all that useful. On the other hand, for text, programming (I 
think, not being a programmer), 3D modeling with Blender, Gimp image 
manipulation, etc. etc., there's nothing better and it's absolutely 
stable. And the number of Net tools, of all sorts, available makes it 
indispensable. I again want to mention the Zaurus PDA, which I take with 
me everywhere, and do a fair amount of my work on - and it's linux-based; 
you can download just about everything you need for it (for example, I 
have Kismet, perl, dig, pico, wget, etc. etc.).

I also mentioned before the GNU disks for Windows, which allow a full set 
of linux tools to be installed on anything from Win3.1 through XP; I think 
some of them will even run on older DOS machines. 

Wireless Hacks, 100 Industrial-Strength Tips & Tools, Rob Flickenger
O'Reilly, 2003 . The whole Hacks series from O'Reilly is great and
relatively new. This one deals with hands-on hardware and software
suggestions, including ways to make antennas, how to add on antennas to
laptops, long line-of-sight connections, WiFi and Bluetooth information
including incredible software, etc. It's interesting that Wireless is
paralleling old-time ham radio - people are building all sorts of wireless
gadgets, having hotspot contests (there were and probably still are DXing
- distance reception - contests for ham radio operators), forming
temporary communities, etc. (Somewhere there's a Phd thesis here; both
media are characterized to some extent by make-shift or bricolage hacking
approaches.) I love this book - and in fact love the whole wireless
revolution - it's incredibly exciting to have the world at one's finger-
tips, one's mind extending through the palm into a huge cerebral database
of humanity which is still growing, probably exponentially. Azure is from 
Huntington Beach; with the Zaurus PDA, just about anywhere in New York, we 
can immediately view the coast about a mile from her parents' home, 
weather, surfers and all.

Other books I use regularly are Amazon Hacks and Google Hacks, both of 
which I've described before. I really recommend these as well.

Mastering Regular Expressions, 2nd edition, Jeffrey Friedl, O'Reilly, 2002
. Wow, this is a fairly long and detailed handbook for those of us who
otherwise might have an afternoon free. For those who don't know, a
regular expression is a _framework_ which filters or sorts in any number
of ways. For example [0-9] can represent any single digit number. As in
DOS, etc., * is a "wildcard." An example is (?<=\d)(?=(\d\d\d)+$) found on
p. 65. Expressions are used with commands such as tr, grep, sed, awk, and
just about any language - they're found all over perl. They provide
shortcuts for complex text manipulation. For example, if I wanted to 
eliminate all blank lines in this file ("foo"), I might enter, at the 
prompt, grep -v ^$ foo > bar, and that would do it.

This book gives you far more information than you might ever need - but 
it's nice to know it's there.

The New Media Reader, eds. Noah Wardrip-Fruin and Nick Montfort, MIT, 
2003 . Personally, I find this book incredibly useful. It was the subject 
of a full month on the Empyre mailing list, during which the term "New 
Media" (and others) was debated; a similar debate has now opened on 
Nettime. The book has what might be considered primordial articles by 
Billy Kluver, Ivan Sutherland, Raymond Williams, McLuhan, Joseph 
Weizenbaum (yay! Eliza), among others. It goes roughly through 1994, with 
the disk going through 1996; the idea is to develop the roots and possible 
foundations of a discourse before the 'explosion' of online art. The 
layout is excellent, as is the accompanying cdrom. 

I do wish there were more on MOOs and MUDs etc. in it, but there are 
selections from Brenda Laurel and Sherry Turkle. On the other hand, the 
term "New Media" has become a grab-bag (as has "postmodernism" for 
example) for just about every techno-cultural change, that it's hard to 
know where any book should begin and end. My own interest is along the 
lines of phenomenology and psychoanalysis, as well as early environments 
(some of which are on the disk), and there's an enormous amount to keep me 
interested.

In this regard, by the way, I want also to mention Jon Marshall's work on 
the Cybermind email list - he's been writing on it and analyzing for 
years, and I think this sort of thing - following an online community in 
depth - is enormously valuable in understanding, not only "online" per se, 
but the very nature of culture and consciousness.

AND:

Classical Chinese Literature, An Anthology of Translations, Volume I: From 
Antiquity to the Tang Dynasty, eds. John Minford and Joseph S. M. Lau, 
Columbia and Chinese University, 2000 . I'd seen this around, but never 
could afford it until I found it at Mercer Street Books here in New York. 
It's over 1100 pages of literary materials, some given in several trans- 
lations and numerous European languages, including French, Latin, German, 
etc. The result is an odd but extremely useful dialectic among cultures; 
some of the translations are hundreds of years old. 

The reason I tend towards these enormous anthologies, is that I'm a 
sinophile, but not sinologist; I'm introduced to works I'd never see 
otherwise. There's even a section of the Thousand Character Essay in here. 
The comparative translations are incredibly useful, by the way, since I 
have a feeling that things like the Book of Songs/Odes are generally 
massacred.

Along these lines, I'm also reading the full version of Wu Cheng'en's
Journey to the West - part of which Waley translated as Monkey. I'm now on
page 1857 out of 2300 plus. There are four paperback volumes, translated
by W. J. F.  Jenner, put out by the Foreign Languages Press, Peking. I 
cannot recommend this work enough - it's brilliant and incessant and one 
really needs to go through the full 100 chapters, with their poems, 
cosmological allusions, and so forth, to understand the work. It's been 
quite useful as an aid to understanding a great many other works as well, 
since there is much Taoist/Buddhist magic in it, not to mention lamaism, 
Confucism, and so forth. (By the way, the Foreign Language Press now 
prints a great number of translations of classic texts for very little 
money - do check them out.)

Domesday Book, A Complete Translation, various, 1992, Penguin, 2002 . I'd 
never read nor seen the Domesday book before this, and it's mainly an 
account from 1086 of tax roles and demographics across Norman England. On 
the other hand, if you have patience with this, you'll learn more about 
the roots of Anglo-American culture, than from any other source I can 
think of. It's amazing that this full accounting of a nation-in-the-making 
has survived for close to a thousand years - and that it was even compiled 
at all. For me, it relates well to much earlier Sumerian, Akkadian, 
Babylonian, etc. temple and landholding records. It's fascinating to pick 
up (well it's over 1400 pages of small print) and read at will.

Hegemony or Survival, America's Quest for Global Dominance, Noam Chomsky, 
Metropolitan, 2003 . I'm slowly moving through this, trying not to commit 
suicide. The book is simultaneously a warning and an account of what went 
wrong and continues to go wrong. Anything on American Empire is worth 
reading as is Hannah Arendt on imperialism for that matter. Chomsky's 
account of nuclear strategy is the most frightening thing of all. 

The problem is - what to do with the book? The account is enormous and 
furious and there's nowhere to go but do check out 
http://www.americanempireproject.com .

I Ching, James Legge translation reorganized by Raymond Vanover, Mentor, 
1971 . I'm not so much interested in the predictive nature of the work, as 
I am in the appendices which reflect Chinese cosmogony. Legge does his 
best translation work with Confucian texts, but at least he's not turning 
the I Ching into a Jungian treatise, for which I'm grateful. This is an 
older Mentor paperback and I highly recommend it if you can find it. I 
appreciate the technical nature of the notes as well.

Kievan Russia, George Vernadsky, Yale, 1948, paperback, 1976 . I realize 
this is old, but since I'm a fan of The Russian Primary Chronicle 
(translated by Samuel Cross in two quite old editions as well), this is 
great as background reading. Obviously, most North Americans know little 
about Russian history (not to mention philosophy - and there are a number 
of anthologies available here), and this helps a great deal. I have no 
idea how the field has progressed, but the book is eminently readable and 
detailed.

Biogeochemistry, An Analysis of Global Change, second edition, William H. 
Schlesinger, Academic Press, 1997-97 . All I can say is get this book if 
you're interested in issues of global warming, pollution, planetary cycles 
of elements, and so forth. It's one of the most detailed accounts I've 
read, and gives clear examples of the complexity of the world ecosystem 
and its biomes. Be warned this is a technical book, and requires close 
attention to the text.

Finally, The Mary Shelley Reader, eds. Betty T. Bennett & Charles E. 
Robinson, Oxford, 1990. I'm a fan, this is a great collection, including 
the original 1818 version of Frankenstein, letters, reviews, and so forth. 
Buy it! Now I'm reading some of Keats' letters - I love these people!
