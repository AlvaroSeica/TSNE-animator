Where are we going; what will we do when we get there?
Will we ever get where we are going; will the going be gotten?
Will it disappear like the rainbow's foundation?
Will it pass through us; will it be a mirage?
In the morning on waking, these texts are forsaken,
Drawn dreaming among the poets, whose footsteps are hardened by sea.
I take up names and drop them in the registry of stars for everyone.
I have no proof of reading; the letters slide among us.
Tell me my name.
