Dumb Hacks Failing Down Like Reign!


Talking to _Jennifer_ on IRC with an /exec yes command: Streaming y's! 
Tears fell down the screen! 
y!
Gargantuan cumulus accumulations of y's blocking any content! I couldn't
enter the holes! There weren't any! No doors, gateways, nothing! I was 
lost, tossed, crossed!
y!
Oh, I tried to stop it with everything, control-c, control-d, control-z,
control-x, zoom zoom zoom!!!
y!
The y's really gobbled up the CPU!!!!!! 
y!
My God, how they do go on, or as I pointed out, just enter yes at the
prompt in any shell! Stuck with positivity! 
y!
Here's the y's, of which there were megabytes!
y!
y y y y y y y y y
y!
Didn't even get through the yes's - so fast they came! Just the y's - 
zoom zoom zoom!!! after letter number one!!!!!

And here's the settings on the Phoenix software!

Earlier, I tried this, subbed Daishin Nikuko root@clara.julu.net - to
cybermind. It returned this address:
Nikuko root@clara.julu.net daishin@panix.com
from the listserv!

Stuck with negativity! I couldn't root around! I couldn't do anything!
Tried the same thing on fop-l, guess what! Nothing, well, beyond this!

Dear listserv, what gives! Then I couldn't send out, well I could per-
sonally, but clara.julu.net has no DNS entry! Astounding, what!
So perplexed am I! 

I was just about to take over a GIGANTIC DOMAIN! I was just about ...  to
crack the system, come out the other side! I would have taken you with me! 
Whole worlds await us!

We would have been Queens! Amazed at the weakness of th' SYSTEM!!! 
Blanked out the World o' COMMERCE! Devastated each other 
all the way down
to the /root!!!!! 

O Jennifer! It was not to be! 

Cache me on ytalk c u l8r!!!
