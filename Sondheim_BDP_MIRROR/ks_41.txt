Japanese Bullet Train Miracle At Least 300 Kilometers / Hour zzzzzzzzzzzz


The shinkansen Nozomi 500 is beautiful vector train Dreamed or Hoped to a
point or aerodynamic edge; the rest of the train is an afterthought. Some-
where I will be dreaming such an entraining of the signifier in the full-
ness of its disappearance. We have not yet arrived at our destination
which is always already in the past. zzzzzzzzzzzzzz You will see the great
wheel of the landscape turning quickly against the train, slower and slow-
er in the distance, controlled by the affine displacement of an invisible
access. zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz The beauty is all that is to be desired.
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz For the closer the world and the greater the detail,
the faster it passes before us - and the farther the world and the lesser
the detail, the slower for contemplation. zzzzzzzzz Thus youth hurries by,
full of the fascination for things, while age and wisdom bring the long
and distant view, lacking detail, but a panorama worthy of languorous med-
itation. zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz O beauty of the Nozomi 500 electrically creat-
ing new worlds and dreams for us! zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz O beauty of the No-
zomi 500 reinvigorating the old! zzzzzzzzzzz
