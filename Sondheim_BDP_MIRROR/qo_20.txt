Texts


Receiving _this_ space of reading which is always open, penetrated, a
perforated space splayed for reply or deletion and therefore fragile, the
space of a membrane, torn-space, there is always _this_ space on the other
end/other hand, space of writing which is foreclosed, null after sending,
re-articulated in archive or hard-copy. This project which presses against
my limbs, a discursive formation, is rooted in the begin- ning of the
Internet Text, which is rooted at an unknown measure; I have no record of
chronology and the start of distribution, before cybermind and fiction-
of-philosophy, possessing only the text's entirety, all fourteen files
1-14, beginning now a second alphabetic set with extended subject matter.

If you have followed me so far or are tired of losing me, turning around
by the birch (denuded by illness as the species slowly disappears), to
retrace the path where the roots begin, you might want to once again
examine those sequences of the initial text as prove relevant or summary,
in particular the introduction and vocabularies or outlines scattered
among the whole. It is in these sections that notions of address, protocol,
recognition, spew, emission, uncanny, imaginary, web inversion, violation
fabric, indexical embodiment, rewrite, and so forth are developed;  and it
is these sections which foreground the current texts, which cannot repeat
what has gone before, but exist as a twisted birch dying by the side of
the path, without the nourishment already given. 

The following sections of the files are useful for any revival, and may 
be retrieved through http://www.uio.no/~mwatz/cybermind/texts/sondheim.html

(In NET1.TXT):
All the beginning sections, including the Introduction to the project
as a whole, contain useful material.
(In NET4.TXT):
SUMMARY OF INTERNET TEXT: Brief description of basic concepts.
(In NET5.TXT)
Partial Summary of Internet Text (from Web Text)
(In NET14.TXT):
Brief Glossary of Terms from Internet Text

Surrounding sections contain or portray the aura of this skeleton. A 
certain _mesmeric_ effect, of course, may be obtained, by reading the whole.
