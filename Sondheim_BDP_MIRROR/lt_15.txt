  one might develop the phenomenology of the carapace in relation  
  to the potential for interiority in hostile world: huddle/cuddle:  
  but instead let us think of an extruded prosthesis or obdurate  
  membrane. what is within receives noise from the filtered world,  
  compacts the same, wary of what remains without. creatures insist  
  on division, on the drawings of negations, distinctions; the flux  
  is temporarily distended, held at bay. one might withdraw, live  
  within the interstices of the carapace, a holdfast open in every  
  direction; living in information society, one becomes part of the  
  filter itself. how can i separate an eye from the others to which  
  it adheres? crawl through the archaeology of the fragments of   
  bones. every assemblage is the result of enormous pressure; what  
  is torn asunder is reassembled only at the price of distortion at  
  the limit-edges which shudder in rejoining. ever-increasing stress  
  is the result of this subaltern life; carapace or character-armor  
  - it is all the same beneath imploded signifiers, extinctions,  
  pollutions reaching down to the very depths of the seas.
