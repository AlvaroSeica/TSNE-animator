MOO-Like Narcissism

Alan makes Alan very nervous! In his attempt to kick Alan, Alan falls head
over heals in love! Alan touches Alan and thinks, wow! You're really
there! Alan yells at Alan and immediately regrets it; Alan is sorrowful.
Alan yells to Alan GRAAAAHR ROOOORRRR!!! Alan smiles at Alan with a beau-
tiful twinkle in her eye! No one can tell whether Alan laughs with or at
Alan! Alan agrees with Alan because the sky is blue and the truth will
out! Alan sends Alan into fits of uproarious giggling! Alan grins to Alan
just about, oh Alan doesn't know, maybe about the weather!!! Alan hugs
Alan with a warmth rarely felt in cyberspace, with true emotion. Alan hums
hmmm to Alan ahmmmm to Alan hmhmmmmmrhmmmm to Alan hum hum hum! Alan kis-
ses Alan ever so sweetly, like the Cedars of Lebanon if they could kiss!
Alan nods to Alan recognizing Alan's astute analysis in this matter. Alan
sighs so that Alan will hear and respond with warm and embracing sympathy.
Alan sings to Alan beautiful stories about life beneath the kitchen hearth
Alan wonders what Alan could mean by such pleasurable words! Alan yawns to
Alan you know we are so listening boring you hearing tiring here.
