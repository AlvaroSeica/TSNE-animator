Leftist Caught Red-Handed in Bad Pun


	Sarah Williamson was arrested last night for spamming a number of
email lists with a 'bad pun,' Yorkshire Heights police reported last
night.  'The complaints were overwhelming,' John Stockton, chief, said.
'We had to do something.'

	The pun went as follows: "'It takes a village to raise a child.' 
- Hillary Clinton. 'It takes an idiot to raze a village.' - George Bush."

	Arraignment Tuesday at the Courthouse. Visitors welcome. (AP)
