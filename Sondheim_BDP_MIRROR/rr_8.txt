states of crisis and exception


From Dirk Vekemans -


"Truck :: n. a self-propelled vehicle for carrying goods" :  with this 
lexical lemma and a simple formula (every month a new 'driver' as guest 
editor for his Truck) writer and editor Halvard Johnson started an 
enticing new literary blog early on in 2011. After a few hick-ups 
Halvard's Truck got well on the road and is now producing a wide variety 
of writing each month. Guest editors who took the wheel include Andrew 
Burke, Jukka-Pekka Kervinen, Lars Palm, Elizabeth Switaj and Douglas 
Barbour. This November's guest-editor is Belgian internet author and 
graphical artist Dirk Vekemans who is happily using his role to both 
introducing some Belgian authors to a wider international audience and to 
launch his new project 'SIEGE'. SIEGE promise to take us far into 2013 
with a series of publications and events focusing on one theme: the 
concept of 'State of Exception' as worked out by the Italian philosopher 
Giorgio Agamben. To set this off, Dirk asked several authors whose work he 
considered relevant to the theme to contribute something of their choice. 
Here's his editorial statement:
