Politics


Your bad politics are because your not me
and you dont know dont you me
but if you burn that child again
Ill kill you and your bad politics
wont mean shit around here

Your bad politics you quitter walking out like that
because Sandra had no idea like I told you
MOO going down in flames   MOO going down in flames
kind of like heating up the mother board
like I told you

Your bad politics   you worms    get you money
bring you wrap you like those hungered snakes
theyve got wrapped around that doctor symbol
like old Hypocrites says
jerk up the flames   jerk up the frames
you   can't SEE what the fuss is about 
anyway

Your bad politics   you neurotic   you excuses
like you want out   theres words for it like kill
or just take the exit bye-bye   at-ways will show you
things you never knew existed
when your not so full of RAM

Your bad politics keep spouting to me
and anyone that READS   nothing is real so 
go down on me baby
but phone-babys all the lines there is
here-baby I pass it to you   pass it to you
at-forward at-delete or something or other
yours a gone world baby   gone
like you keep spouting like that
