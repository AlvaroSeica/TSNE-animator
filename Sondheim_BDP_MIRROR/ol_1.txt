The doctor wears thick pince-nez. He wears a black top-hat. He carries 
a cane. The doctor is silent. His eyes glitter.

Nikuko says: But you must do one thing for me doctor.
The doctor is silent. He is waiting. Waiting gives him an advantage.

'such was the occasion, that this old-new work has taken a great deal of 
grief and perspicacity in its production and subsequent compression. 
something there is that loves the pocket, the inverted effusion of Richard 
Wagner against all strains and strengths of the onslaught of the new 
millennium. I harbor no delusions as to its efficacy; however, consider 
this a remnant of what might have been, had humanity ever lived up to its 
delusions.' http://www.asondheim.org/wagners.mp4
