Buffers Files Tools Edit Search Help
 
Hell is catching the presence of the file thrown against the glass
doors of the library where no one goes anymore nor should they; hell
is buffered realities, salvages, contusions of alternative readings,
always another, perfect file; hell is _tool_ or tools modified to
search for help, editing out those words <strike>me dead</strike>
that you would act & what heaven. That would never read again. That
tomb. 

& for the glass door covers with blood your reflection. & that the
buffered real binds you. & that they pass files & whimpers. & that
your bloody tools hack flesh from brain. & that your thoughts are
edited. & that you search for help.
