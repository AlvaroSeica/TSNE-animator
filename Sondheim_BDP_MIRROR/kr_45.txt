from the Ispell (spell-check) personal dictionary -

Avatar references those
avatars loved by Jennifer, swollen by Nikuko, following the path of
bushido, avoiding
clots of subjectivities, knots and noted -
coherencies, as if there were such or me. These
consensualities in
cyberspace or
emergences worried and
empathized through the relationship of (virtual)
extensivity. From my viewpoint, such
extrusions curled in on themselves, a
feedforward relationship, as if a 
filmmaker used outdated
filmstock with a life of its own. Then
geomatics traced their outlines, an
indexicality
interpenetrating
jennifer, _small-j,_ a function, not unlike that assigned
Julu
literarily and elsewhere. An emergence
morphs through 
Nikuko for example, a collocation of 
signifiers under ten-
sions
subtexted everywhere. Whatever the inten-
tions,
voiceovers make the world, as God said, let there be light, a form of
worlding _thus._
