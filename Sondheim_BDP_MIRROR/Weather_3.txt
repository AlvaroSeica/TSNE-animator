Net sex - rough outline of material in Internet Text -


(I've been thinking about net sex, Net sex, net.sex, "third sex," again 
and wrote the following outline which I'll use for part of a panel at a 
narrativity conference coming up. I thought it might be of interest here.)

1 language loses its linguistic in net sex
2 self/other/self returns to other/self/other
3 ravishment is the unraveling of language;
4 thus your desire is spoken _by the other_
5 the masochist language returning to substance with orgasm: hhhhhhhhhhh
6 thus hhhhhhhhhhhhh becomes meaning's annihilation, gesture
7 if _you_ disappear in real sex, _your_ disappears in cybersex
8 the _your_ becoming the mouth or speech of the other
9 third sex is skinned sex, the mouthing of the body, its equivalences
  scattered among interpenetrated writings
10 once you find out you don't know who you are you can't return to the 
  security of knowledge whatever
11 third sex as the writing of the unconscious (who possesses it?)
12 inscription of the body by the other: cuts and sutures
13 the inscription by the other is the fissure of the one (subject)
14 the _your_: what you would and what you wouldn't have said
15 that the imaginary is more real than the real - because the unconscious
   seduces - you're always more real than I am
16 it is the _continuous rewrite_ of the body
17 shaved body - you slide the _your_ into me
18 what you _say,_ is; what I say, opens a space, opens _me_
19 without me saying, you saying, _there is no me_
20 net sex as transference, _listening-to_
  20a analyst out of site, _neither here nor there_
  20b I am languaged into hir presence, languaging as the totality of my
      presence
  20c:
 "The analysis must aim at the passage of true speech, joining the subject 
 to an other subject, on the other side of the wall of language. That is 
 the final relation of the subject to a genuine Other, to the Other who 
 gives the answer one doesn't expect, which defines the terminal point of 
 the analysis." (Jacques Lacan, The Seminar Book II)
  20d always the potential of termination/effacement in third sex
  20e therefore I beg you to let me _in,_ i.e. to _let me _be._
21 I tell you everything, _the truth_: this is all that I have to offer.
22 I am rewritten into a covenant with you.
23: archaic fantasies:
 "The appearance of disturbing fantasies or of a stream of archaic images 
 leads the patient to the edge of subjective destructuration. He then 
 takes refuge in love for the analyst in order to avoid crossing the 
 borders of psychosis. But this hostile love is not only a protection; it 
 can become the index of the regressive situation into which the patient 
 has now entered, a state of primitive fusion and confusion. The analyst 
 who then clings to his role as the analyzer of neurosis is then playing 
 the game of the patient, who speaks of love in order not to confront the 
 limits of existence, which are life and death.

 The patient gives the appearance of enjoying the realm of sexualized
 existence, but that is only to avoid approaching his own loss. At this
 stage, two possibilities are open to him: to make the analyst abandon his
 reserve, so that he becomes one individual among others, or to force him
 to become even more impenetrable, to harden his role as the receiver and
 transmitter of discourse." (Francois Roustang, psychoanalysis never lets
 go)
24 in third sex, we are all patients, accompanied by inescapable fantasms
25 this is the uncanny of the body under rewrite, the ascii unconscious
26 you rearrange my organs, I return inchoate matter
27 (Roustang) "One must give extended attention to the most archaic if 
  one is to have a chance to get out of it;"
28 _shape-riding_ as the dream of transference, stuttering of being,
  half-presences, absences, Hittite formations...
29 _always_ in this space: whose speaking, whose voice?
30 reflectances, transferences: what _matter_
31 blinds and decoys, tracings or protean trajectories equivalent to their
   convoluted and opened spaces
32 surfaces of desire: the trembling becomes too intense to type
33 there is ultimately no source to the language, no sink; it continues
  inchoate, nondescript, babbling
