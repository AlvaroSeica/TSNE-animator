Getting Lively


There are words that won't do for deconstruction; "Lively" is one of them! 
I'd love to be a lively deconstructionist! And I want these texts to sing!
I wouldn't mind as well if you found them "cute"! I don't want to scare
you away! I work hard at "lovely" language. "That's lovely, dear." (I want
to know as well: Why don't my books glow in the dark? I can read this 
screen anywhere!)

But I want to be Lively as puppies, as angry as punk, murderously cooled 
and confused as generation-x, splayed wide open in s/m masochism of your 
choice, wrapping you in rope in b/d domination of your choice! As long as 
we're Lively, everything's all right!

I want the words to have "punch" to them! But I don't want to hurt any-
body! "Punch" makes things Lively, that's for sure! I like the apostrophe 
as well.

"Now, I've been so Lively in real life for a while, that I just had to let
the text go for a while. I want everything here to have _energy,_" Tiffany
said. She looked around the barren screen, letters of peach against laven-
der. "But anger," Travis replied slowly. His dark eyes shot lightning ac-
ross the ASCII sky. "The world is damned, doomed." He turned slowly, gaz-
ing at the approaching thunderheads. They seemed to have "punch" in them.
