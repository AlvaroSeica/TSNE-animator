Wyrd


A woman is singing "passion for the road" on an advertisement. Her voice 
is hoarse pushed to the limit; she's almost but not quite out of control, 
it's Janis Joplin all over again. She has to be violently forcing air 
through the throat, upper chest, microphone standing swinging in front of 
her, the drums almost dulled by comparison, forget about the bass. Is it 
capital that is being performed here? What are her emotional parameters?

Writing on-line I feel waves of tension and heat rise up my shoulders,
back, neck. My arms tense; everything is angry around me. I want to cut
through the text cut through the screen cut through the flesh. The topic
splatters through the wires, is almost irrelevant. It gets funneled
through a channel or a furrow. It breaks the writing in two.

The politics of language on the Net are the politics of wryting. There is
no separation between the wyrd and its production. Think of wyrd as mnemic
symbol (Freud quoted in Laplanche and Pontalis): "By this means the ego
succeeds in freeing itself from the contradiction; but instead, it has
burdened itself with a mnemic symbol which finds a lodgement in conscious-
ness, like a sort of parasite, either in the form of an unresolvable motor
innervation or as a constantly recurring hallucinatory sensation." Such
mnemic symbols have the weight of poetic language, protolanguage: the body
is blocked (as in blocking an actress in a play, stage-blocking) (as in 
disrupted, foreclosed, tumescent), capital flourishing from the beautiful 
whiteness of her throat, upon which is written the guise of information.

(Thinking of Lyotard's Pacific Wall, white white white white white.)
