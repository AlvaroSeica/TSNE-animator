Artificial Life





I am still puzzling over entropy and information in relation to artificial

life. Consider a suitably large enclosed screen environment, steady-state

in terms of energy input from an "external" framework. Is it necessarily

true then that the degree of entropy remains constant internally? Note

that there is no _increase_ of energy in this model; the quantity E is

also constant. _Within_ the environment, one can imagine local areas in

non-equilibrium potential wells, and other areas remaining in equilibrium

with a specified degree of disorder. Within the wells, information

increases; this is ultimately a result of the external energy input. Such

input transforms into _time._ The question is what happens to the entropy? 

In a closed system with finite energy, entropy increases; in our system,

which may be considered _virtually open,_ entropy seems to decrease as

information increases.* Ultimately, can one consider the environment _to-

tally ordered,_ and what would constitute this? Would this be - or more to

the point _could_ this be a form of self-organization, self-conscious-

ness, and if the latter, would it conceivably involved the use of external

data-storage devices? If so, these devices would presumably be aligned or

internalized with the life-forms (I wrote a story about Travis in one of

the Internet Text files about this); there would be no mechanical move-

ment, no thought processes whatsoever, already a form of death...



*which is the opposite I believe of the definition of entropy in informa- 

tion theory.



(Can someone help with the mathematics here?)
