--


here on the shore the wind is howling like i never heard it howl
here on the shore there are waves and a freighter black freighter riding
high in the sea and the wind void
here there is rain cutting through like black knives of black steel
here there is black wind cutting through black stars in black skies
lights by the quayside nothing visible cranes down in violation fabric
and void slag heaping ore
here on the shore the winds are screaming now the neighbors quiet nothing
stolen in this house lashed by wind and rain
here by the shore the wind and black rain lash the black shore and
void freighter black howling knives
here by the shore warm sheets of black wind and black rain scream against
the headlights of the black car on the black road guiding towards the
void shore illuminated by headlights and void illuminated ice
here on the shore where i can't write can't think here on the shore where
i can't see can't speak too much sound lag black void blank void screen
electricity flicking in black shore void house void black ice
shore silent on this black netted shore
and void internet stolen by neighbors in this black iced shore house
and void black wind black rain i leave before electric howling knives
void internet eerie silent and black
