Proper Names, Rigid Designators, Possible Worlds, Clean and Proper Worlds

What happens when the plasma hits? When the apparatus dissolves in fugue? 
What occurs in borderline states when Socrates' face is blasted into
pavement? What results from temperatures high and hard enough to vaporize
brittle bone, skull, metal, visage? Gravity spreading features across
plateaus thunged flat, shimmered particles, absorption? Possum feral
worlds without name or number, P of I iiiiiii.
