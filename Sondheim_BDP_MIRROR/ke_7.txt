"He would have regretted this as well." (Epitaph)

He wanted to live through a lifetime of regrets. He wanted to continue
living rather than dying, even though living was compounded with con-
stant regrets. He regretted everything or so much that he became emo-
tionally catatonic. He regretted speaking these words, writing his
epitaph only hours before he died. He would have regretted speaking
these words, would have regretted writing his epitaph only hours be-
fore he would have died.
