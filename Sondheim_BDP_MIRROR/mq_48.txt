ZECHARIAH ii


Now what is of interest here, among us, is that I did not place Zechariah 
on the hard drive, nor have I read Zechariah recently; it is either the 
semblance of a hack, or the semblance of an originary distribution within 
WinXP home. Look to your own hard drives, check at sector 1016 and higher, 
search for Zechariah. Perhaps it is the beginning of the end, o Jerusalem, 
of which I have had suspicion; perhaps it is an annotation from the relig- 
ious among us.

Of the materials, of the rest which I have placed there, emergent and 
fragmented, nothing standing out at 666.
