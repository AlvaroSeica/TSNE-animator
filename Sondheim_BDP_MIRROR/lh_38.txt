Parable


This occurred somewhere in southern Wa. Nikuko and Izanagi came across a
yamabushi (itinerant priest). The landscape disappeared; it was everywhere
and nowhere at once. Izanagi's voice was heard, declaring itself a tree
and boulder; and Nikuko's voice responded, declaring itself mountain and
mountain-stream. Then everything was normal, just as it had been, except
for the yamabushi, who disappeared in turn. It's either the yamabushi or
everything, said Nikuko, one or the other, never both at once. Izanagi
replied, The yamabushi was Death, who has no viewpoint; we move among
worlds, our focus is tiny. At that moment Nikuko was enlightened; looking
up, she saw the yamabushi walking away in the distance.
