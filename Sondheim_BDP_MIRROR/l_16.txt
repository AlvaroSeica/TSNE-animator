Alain Badiou, from On a Finally Objectless Subject, in Who Comes After 
the Subject (eds. Cadava, Connor, Nancy):

"If it is possible: What is thus beyond the subject if not the very same
subject dissociated or subtracted from reflexive jurisdiction, un-consti-
tuting, untied from all supports unrelated to the process of a truth - of
which the subject would be but a finite fragment? 

I call subject the local or finite status of a truth. A subject is what is
_locally born out._
