Parable


One day Nikuko left Wa to see the worlds she had created. She traveled
through Afghanistan and the outskirts of the Roman Empire, coming at last
to Palestine. Here she walked towards the Galil, having heard of a new
prophet, as prominent as Izanagi. She was disappointed; his voice was thin
and his message all too familiar; he also spoke of a poverty of gods. One
day she rose in the morning to the sound of weeping; it was the prophet,
Jesus, forlorn and weeping. I will lose my followers, he said to Nikuko, I
have prayed over and over again for a miracle, and none is forthcoming.
Nikuko said, I can help you; the trouble is that men can walk on water,
and there is nothing to be done here. With that, she created drowning and
forgetfulness; men no longer remembered the flowing of streams and rivers
beneath their feet. When the prophet walked on water, it was he alone who
did so; the rest, by diminution, worshiped him as the miraculous son of
God.
