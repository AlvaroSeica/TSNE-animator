Waste


Nikuko ties a rope around my erect penis. It holds it in place forever. 
It says "the number one" in kanji and my native tongue. It sways hard
and heavy here. The waste stays in. The waste will burst me. 

Nikuko ties a $thing called "rope" around my @describe erect $thing called
"penis." It @holds it in place forever. It "the number one @emote in
$thing called "kanji" and my @describe native $thing called "tongue." It
@sways @describe hard and heavy $thing called "here." The $thing called
"waste" @stays in. The $thing called "waste" will @burst me.

A flood of kanji emerges. The data-base distends with a fork-bomb. MOO
transforms hard drive. It sways hard and heavy here. MOO crashes, heads
have a fly-down into megnetic domains. Unrecoverable...

_Nikuko ties a rope around my erect penis. It holds it in place forever.
She uses me to @create $things. I absorb #numbers in the database. I'm
pregnant with #numbers, I'm bursting with #numbers. The bladder explodes._

Look rope.
You see nothing special.]
