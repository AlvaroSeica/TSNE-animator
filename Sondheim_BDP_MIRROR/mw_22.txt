the two nervous hands of god


she touched him, cleaning her hands
before and after; her womb a source
of pollution, his member likewise -
in the twilight, these bodies of disease, 
ill at ease, suppuration -

of one above, of one below,
of two, the one above, below,
the one below, above,
of wuda, minor ablutions - 
of ghusl, major ablutions -
touching or intercourse,
of two, of one asunder -

"Then he [the Prophet] made the end [of his words] correspond to the be-
ginning in feminine gender, while he placed the masculine between the
two. For he began with 'women' and he ended with 'prayer,' and both words
are feminine. Perfume stands between the two, just as the masculine stands
between two feminines in existence. For the man is placed between an
Essence from which he becomes manifest and a woman who becomes manifest
from him. Hence he is between two feminines: the feminine gender of the
Essence and the real femininity of the woman. In a similar way, 'women' is
a real feminine, while 'prayer' is an unreal feminine. Between the two,
'perfume' is like Adam between the Essence from which he comes into
existence, and Eve, who comes into existence from him." (Ibn al-'Arabi, in 
Sachiko Murata, The Tao of Islam, A Sourcebook on Gender Relationships in 
Islamic Thought.)

" & i will remain awake -
i will remain awake -
forever & forever -
my eyes remain & witness
the rain from heaven -
the dark rain from darker heaven -
my darker eyes -
my darker eyes - "

" & i will record everything as i am a fallen angel -
& i will play back every reeling & unreeling -
& they will worry down & down among the fallen angels -
& the two nervous hands of god
the two nervous hands of god
closing & opening
closing & opening "
