plum dumplings (oola, can you imagine?)


cutting through the sickly-sweet smell of plum dumplings, warm like an
infant's slushy bowel movement overflowing the swollen sac of diapers
half-off the tiny distended body, the knife separates the luscious sweet
crust from itself, purple sweetness of bruises on breasts engorged with
blood and milk, my stomach beginning the processes of slow decay, swirl of
brown sweet liquid syrup sugars against flaccid skin, inverted anal flesh
waiting for your clotted tongue, so tumescent bodies fill all space all
time, so close to vomiting I drink my own slew back down and down again,
queasy, lurching through sweet churning fluids, heated, spewing, I spread
your bowels wet with plum-time odors, drown myself in sweet brown-violet
molasses for you and me, oozing between diarrhea lips, torn plum bits
soaking through purple hazy days
