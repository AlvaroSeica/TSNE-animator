Re: REVIEW

I am DESPERATE to see my name in print, to reproduce the INTERNET TEXT in 
full or in part SOMEWHERE ELSE other than the NET, I can't EVEN GET INTO 
WIRED'S TIRED much less WIRED'S WIRED and NEED YOUR HELP in THIS 
IMPORTANT TASK before all 1200 or whatever pages get lost in the HUGE 
DATAPLEX EXPLOSION occurring AT OUR VERY FEET, and joking or not I'M 
SERIOUS ABOUT THIS.

OH TO REVIEW MY OWN WORK with full APLOMB and BEAUTEOUS EXPANSION! I was 
TALKING WITH MICHAEL GURSTEIN about THE WASTE, THE LOSS THAT WOULD ENSUE 
with the simple DEMOLITION OF THE WEB SITE, even though I have backups 
HERE IN BROOKLYN. But there are no mirror-sites, no redundancy ON-LINE 
should my PRECIOUS CARGO be DECIMATED by HARD DISK or VISCOUS CRASH. 

For this REASON I BEG YOU to disseminate THESE TEXTS, MIRROR THEM, PRINT 
THEM IN ANY FINE-LINE PHYSICAL MEDIUM OF YOUR CHOICE, credit yourself 
with THE GREAT DISCOVERY, and joking or not I'M ONLY HALF KIDDING ABOUT 
THIS! All this LABOR should NOT BE LOST! ALAN.
