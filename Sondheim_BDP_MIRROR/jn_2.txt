 


magic (in the form of poetry slam)


a text, one of several thousand
hopeless, eh
sometimes i close my eyes and think ill never have to open them again
blindness can pervade every organ
thinking off lamps going out all over europe
my writing is my hell
disentangled from the matrix that produces it as if there were a nipple
were in the middle of this black bleak space
were there for example downing aircraft
were there driving out villagers by means of ravaging floods
deprivations cholera foodstuffs disappearing like the banks
droughts nuclear devastations reservoirs of viral technologies
it might be a single o cross of t dot on i or j
as if id be dead when you reached the end of this sentence
ill be dead when you reach the end of this sentence
fooled you
cant fool you for long can i
were there firestorms over forests and cities
firestorms across the plains radiations everywhere
third arm breaks out through my chest third eye closes for the last time
legs wilt it wont be long now my last prediction
brakes are on 
cars in reverse embankment looms
downhill looms in the middle very middle of the air very air
im holding on that o or cross of t dot on j or i
its down there fiery black of the screen death white of the screen
sucking sucked away lips bared teeth against one or another bitter letter
hopeless eh
should have dropped out years ago
letter clanks at the bottom of the page theres no bottom no sound
hallucinations setting in schizophrenias schizzing
jagged x across the chest eyes mouth ears
didnt fool you this time did i 
cant keep this up forever
