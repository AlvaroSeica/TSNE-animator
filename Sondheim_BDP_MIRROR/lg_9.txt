more from the Doctor - serration and the birth of language


there's a mark in the sky
there's a hole in my head
there are plants in the sky that are doubled
there's a spark in the fire
there's a bone in my foot
there are fields divided, quadrupled

i slide word to word, i fly way up high,
the signifier seems all too dead,
but i know in my mind that is troubled,
i'm decatecting, i knew, and it's dire,
in the midst of the root of the sign
in the wire,
where plains and mountains are peopled,
where mountains and people asserted
against tribes of the plain and their tablets

do you know what i mean when space is serrated,
signs rustle against one another,
codes are codes, signal loads, perforated 
in the language-formation of the other

the analog smooths, integration's the rule
across details, chaos, fractal recursions,
while digital cuts, differentiation's the tool,
noise explodes, language codes in incursions

the serrated edge carries the meaning of grain
of the voice, of the sign foreclosing
on referent, in relation to body and pain,
in relation to fundamental disclosing

the tree has a branch always lending itself
across the metaphysical sheet of assertion,
self-organization lends tending, it's left
the rest of the flesh to inversion

serrations grasp and divide, 
they hold themselves taut in defining,
meandering balks from side to side
the subtext always declining,
articulation is always reclining

serrations repeating gives meaning to text
against structured repetition in the real,
this bursts through desire, body and sex,
intercourse gives birth to the seal

let it go, serrated rhymes carry the words
to other spaces and places desired,
think of nested times, think foreclosing surds,
the tablets already are fired

- Doctor Leopold Konninger
