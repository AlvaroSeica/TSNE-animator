* Sandy Baldwin and I are co-moderating the empyre email list for 
October, on Pain, Suffering, and Death in the Virtual; the above 
is a meditation on the subject.



Precipice 

To write on suicide, or death, or suffering, is always to make a 
wager, not with oneself, but with the other: that the writing 
ultimately is not a talisman, is neither sympathetic nor empathetic 
magic, but exists in a realm of its own, where nothing has 
consequence. Otherwise the writing becomes a cry for help, something 
tawdry, beyond or beneath consideration. So the wager must be made, 
the theory must remains as such, attributed nowhere, to nothing, 
emptied, not of content, but of consequence. What, for example, would 
occur if this were the last written statement I've made, publicly or 
privately? What of the rest of my work, how would that be garnered or 
distributed? The material possessions would be given their due, no 
longer united as collocation, community, or collectivity, but 
transmitted elsewhere, fallen into other and alien hands that would  
efface the history I've taken so much care to preserve. Conversely, 
the digital would be distributed, living within a phenomenology of 
inscription and the corporate - for the digital is always corporate 
and always inscribed - and thus would be disseminated, much as it is 
now, until the material is forgotten, or the sites begin to close 
down, one after another, and everything is lost. I have no faith in 
the digital, but I put my trust there, that something would remain, 
as if in an entirety, within its aegis - that each stroke of the bow 
for example, would carry the movement of a human in its memory, that 
each sound would be the uncanny resonance of that movement. What if 
the movement were the last, that no more sound or movement would 
occur, that all that would come after would be the remnant, debris, 
residue? My father slipped away and then was gone and there is, as 
of yet, no stone to mark him, nothing but the position-in-relation, 
of my mother or other grave, or the graves of my mother's family. The 
stone will be there, obdurate, remarked, unremarked against the 
mountain where the graves are, but that absence, now, of the granite 
also marks the absence of the analogic world, as both analog and 
digital become other within new and competing cosmologies that return 
to us the inconceivability of multiverses and space-time so near the 
Planck's constant as to be always already naught, and forever, and 
beyond recall or recalling-forth. It is froth. Perhaps "It is froth" 
would be the finality of my thought, neither death nor suffering nor 
suicide, but imminent in relation to stroke or cataclysm - what then? 
That the description of froth is froth itself? I am writing this with 
closed eyes, without the recall or resonance as well of the upper 
portions of the essay; it continues and returns, but the return is an 
accident. And I must clear up the feeling that R.H. has betrayed me 
in the past, and has remained smug about it ever since - and yet he 
may well not be alive, or in good health, or even capable of reading 
this. I want to write on Azure and her work, this is something that 
has been with me, a kind of thinking centered on her arrangements and 
rearrangements, her mixture of craft and content half virtual and 
half real, as in the work for example of Ree Morton, or what I 
remember of the work of Nancy Kitchel. But Azure has remained with me 
for so many years now, with a grace I could not imagine, and a 
creativity which is always there and unknowingly bearing the gifts 
of depth of wonder, which has kept me alive, within or without the 
rubble that constitutes my thinking far too often. I am always 
awaiting the world, I am always on the verge, and as I grow older I 
fear that discovery may become nothing but murmur at the futility 
of it all. So I return, still sightless, to the original theme, that 
of the constituting of endpoints, within which one will be unique, 
and begin the recession into history and dispersion that one always 
fears. What we do with our books and belongings is continue a 
process of retardation, holding back the decay, tending them like 
good steward, so that they may yet add another century to their 
well-being. They're dependent in a way that humans are not, and we 
ourselves are not. We are on the lip or nub, not of the body and its 
abjection, but just beyond both, near the precipice where the good 
topples according to catastrophe theory; what remains in the valleys 
are pools of time that themselves seep elsewhen and elsewise. The 
only theory is that within which this self suffuses life and the 
living; theory is always theory with its back to the wall, and its 
back is our own. Thus there is the moment of loss when even 
phenomenology stutters and becomes descriptive physics at best: one 
may describe and describe, but multiverses and holographic horizons 
remain hidden, beyond the pale. We look for clues in our life, for 
our death - and clues in dying for our life. We hope there's 
something more than the scattering angle. We hope, and there's the 
precipice, and there's the end.

Barclay Center and the doomed warehouse

http://www.flickr.com/photos/asondheim/sets/72157631593035206/

"A 19th-century warehouse used for pharma and other displays - I 
was able to obtain a remarkable set of images within it. It's as 
if the whole history of analog archiving were written here, just 
about to be destroyed."

on the verge of destruction, of death.
ramps where horses brought wagon-loads of material up and down
within the building. 
overhead flat-belt wheels for power dissemination in the 19th-
century; these were all that remained.
towers and sad messages and occupy wall street.
retrieved a 50-watt incandescent bulb rated at 230 volts.
left behind so many messages, so much, there were others in
the building, removing things, a tower of wooden cases fell.
death is always already present, the catastrophe.



Against Aphorisms


Facebook is loaded with them. At one point I loved Karl Krauss,
Adorno's Minima Moralia, Schlegel. But aphorisms out of context,
used as slogans on Facebook, presenting the righteous act or 
moment, are deadly; they're inauthentic in the existentialist
sense, cut off; they don't spur to action - they make one feel 
better under capital, they suture the subject with a thinned-out
cleverness, they make it appear as if something actually has 
been accomplished. The more famous the writer quoted, the better
the aphorism appears to be, the name lending false authority to
the vapidity of the words. And Facebook's aphorisms stand for
the speed-up of the attention economy; why worry about something
if an aphorism seems to sum it up in a few words that slip by,
require little thought? The aphorism not only stands in for 
action; it also stands in for the depth of thought and context
necessary for understanding, particularly given the complexities
of the world we live in. This isn't true for all aphorisms, of
course, but the short quote, the succinct phrase, gives us 
pleasure, even when we're contemplating slaughter, racism, 
violence, and so forth. At the least, give sources and urls so
that one might take some sort of action, instead of nothing more
than agreement over the superstructure of word-choice. The use
of aphorisms is as well meaning, as meaning is drained by their
use of them. We should all wake up in the midst of the battle- 
field by any other name...

played on oud, oud with risha, cobza, sarangi, 2 nepalese 
sarangis, and afghan sarinda

and the tune doesn't stay the same, and it gets harsher
and i begin to wonder if i know what i'm doing, some of 
it seems channeling, some of it seems to be holding onto
an idea of music, some of it seems meditative, maybe
enlightened, some of it is lost. it's what's there in
front of me (before me), some of it makes sense, some of
it begs for another player of the same instrument, some
of it begs for proper tuning, brilliant bowing, some of
it desires something beyond the dolorous, some of it is 
just wondering if this can be done, what is it that's
being done, stop making sense, the senseless, some of it
is crying for another master, another mistress, some of
it wants to be heard, some of it is weeping, some of it
is laughing with the harsh word 'joke'

Nothing about you seems to make sense except you were unglued.
Somewhere along the line you were glued and then you grewed.
I want to be in bed with someone I love permanently glued.
Of entrapment, throwing oneself to the winds, becoming unglued
and manufacturing, laying their trails; we get glued tothe spoor.
I WANT MY BABY BACK as the nuclear family is again superglued together,
ric_ rabbit-glued to the earth.
There, not glued together, but it is meaning that worlds the world for
unlimited Jennifer unglued replies "Why is my knowledge limited? Why?"
They are "glued" to the real/virtual subject - through earphones, fingers,
massive, they're useless, they're glued together by a constant intensity,
nuclear families eternally glued together; we ignore or downplay the real-
massive, they're useless, they're just stuck there by a constant intensity.
The whole space shuddering, the space is glued to me, i'm burning; within

remaining glued to the screen writing and rewriting, my fingers moving
Somewhere along glued grewed. echo "Thus spurned, lurks woods, hides

Please Come unglued, the phone cranks and creaks!
I glued shims under the outer rail support for the secondary 
glued to transmission reception, I will be your transitive, I will pass on
all my bad surrealism: glued together like a shoemaker's
particle. Breathe and enter glued earphones 
where europe and antarctica glued by africa, decide.
Our sticky parts are stuck to others, always glued and greasy. 
I will pass on, remaining glued to the screen looking at all the pretty
pictures, my fingers moving, I think they're moving aren't they.

My work is called For Sasha - for Alexander "Sasha" Chislenko, who was on 
Cybermind and went to one of our fleshmeets. Later Sasha committed 
suicide.

The piece is a dissected cube, that's all, with 8 points, 12 lines, 6 
sides, 1 central 3-space. The numbers add up to 27, a characteristic of 
measure polytopes; in n-dimensional space, the total is 3^n; each 
additional dimension is characterized by a "slide" of the previous one, 
which is smeared and duplicated. The points, lines, planes, and central 
solid rotate at different speeds in different directions so the cube 
probably would not re-constitute itself as a cube for a vast amount of 
time. The textures are from my 3d printing work with avatars. The sound is 
sarinda doubled. The video is made from five viewpoints - distance; point; 
line; plane; and solid. There's a sense of purity and mathesis about it, 
as well as a darker undercurrent in the audio, which sounds mournful, 
wailing.
	
The installation is part of a group show, "Systems of Existence," at 
Turing Gallery in Extropia, Second Life. The video is a separate work.

Not Yet Ready for the Big Time

but do need feedback on these -

http://www.alansondheim.org/boww1.mp3 sarangi
http://www.alansondheim.org/boww3.mp3 sarinda
http://www.alansondheim.org/boww4.mp3 violin

I'm frustrated, reaching dead ends, smashing my neural networks,
figuratively speaking, against the figurative wall. Difficult
playing without accompaniment or drone or tabla-box; every 
empty space is a vacancy. I go to sleep with headaches wake up
with more. The bowws move at furious pacing out of my control,
my wakefulness mind is crying out, dear god what are we doing
here, and nothing answers. Oh the depths of yada yada yada.
Anyway, feedback greatly appreciated. And these won't remain 
up forever or even 'that long,' too embarrassed to fail where
others succeed with their eyes and other organs closed.

34 minutes

boww3 redone, 34 minutes of sarinda that desperately needs
feedback. redone with a very short nepalese sarangi bow
which gives more control and finesse. prefer it now as well
as the music. feedback more than welcomed.

Older Sarangi

http://www.alansondheim.org/boww2.mp3

This is the sarangi I got back (is that correct expression)
after several decades and it has very heavy strings, so is
tuned lower than other, the one. It sounds it too, quite
I think good and expressive and I use the bow of the viola
in place of the other bow. The music I think is quite good
too with one mistake I can find. I'm sure it is there, but 
it is quite soothing. Today I just learned carve and crave
have the same letter, which is amazing, I must tell you. I
hope you are thanked from listening.



Barclay Center opening (Jay-Z concert), Brooklyn, 9/28/12

including three birds in the area and a video of the VIP
entrance. Nothing will ever be the same again, but then again,
nothing ever was.


Sarinda / Suroz

http://www.flickr.com/photos/asondheim/sets/72157631654252646/

Some images of the reset instrument and playing technique.
The sound if the instrument is much less tinny in real life.
Recorded with a pocket camera.



Teak

http://lounge.espdisk.com/archives/926
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/teak.mp3

played on nepalese sarangi, which is then raised an octave,
mixed with the original with echo. love the sound on this,
but the wood isn't teak, it might be on the sarinda, which
is a similar instrument, but not on this. jay-z's just left
the arena and there are people milling about like crazy in
the streets, every loud. but why teak then, and not a more
resonant title. so far just a lot of yelling, if they come
back onto the roof i'm to call the police. but i won't. not
at 2 a.m. anyway when people are sleeping and the hatch is
hard to open. teak reminds me of the mountains, i like the
tune and sound of the piece. could do it live as well. yes
i could, with an octave doubler and mixer and reverb, that
would work well, yes it would.



New installation of For Sasha with accouterments

http://www.alansondheim.org/newsasha.mp4

involving other objects in the space smearing &
as if in interruption of the purity of the
geometrical engagement with objects which are 
now permitted to smoke and stutter appropriately
and in addition there are those odd blanks which
cancel out, if momentarily, the entirety of this
virtual world struggling to maintain the vision
of extropian clarity and fulfillment, please 
watch and enjoy

cleverness and the clever


cleverness has the appearance of universal intelligence.
cleverness is the condition of the object in the digital world.
to be clever means to remain on the obsessive surface of the 
catastrophic, punctuated by a tear constituting the imaginary of 
a bridge.
the clever object appears to increase knowledge, but in fact 
constructs both surface and tear.
cleverness is quickly perceived, understood, and appropriated, as 
if it carried the premise and promise of depth.
the clever object is the combination of disparities, coupled and 
mapped together; the awkwardness of this suture is the clever.
clever is a level playing field guaranteeing the perception of 
knowledge's interior, sidestepping its fractal nature.
cleverness exists within the natural wilderness of the digital, 
procuring the analogic through obsessive builds.
cleverness sutures time as well, simultaneously creating and 
deconstructing a zeitgeist whose border apparently extends to 
the edges of the world.
cleverness appears boundless and sustains itself by leaps and 
disparities; it is the enemy of substance, whose depth is 
quickly transformed into the titillation of elicit knowledge in 
the midst of an appreciative community.
cleverness exchanges use value for exchange, and the 
transformation of depth is also the transformation of temporal 
continuity to the time-bite.
the obsessive-compulsive machine is employed to the right in the 
construction of cleverness, just as the time-hack machine, with 
its apparent instanteneity, is employed to the left; in 
cleverness time is never the duration of interiority, but is 
both the long-shot and/or the jump-cut, which appears as an 
exploit.
cleverness is always exploit; at its heart lies the destruction 
or differentiation of long-reading, replacing the analytical by 
the aphoristic.
cleverness thus appears to offer the world, blurring boundary; 
what might be considered technological is proffered as 
phenomenological answer and deployment of philosophical and 
general cultural concern.
cleverness is active passivity passing for action.
the clever can be grasped in its imminence, as if the aporia of 
the immanence of the world were suspect.
the clever leaves nothing and everything unsaid.
the clever is a circumnavigation of the political, drawing the 
strings tighter in its emphasis on quick construction; the 
clever is over before it begins.
the political is transformed into the manifesto and petition, 
whose contents are buried as marxist superstructure becomes 
substructure.
the clever is an image in both time and space; it is collapse, 
but broken collapse; the subject lies in the suture of the 
breakage.
the clever is an epigram whose encapsulated life appears 
elsewhere, compressed into a plane, line, or point; life and its 
history are thereby immolated; in this sense, cleverness is 
breathless.
cleverness is the wit of an object which appears as metaphoric 
totality; it breaks with the tradition of breaking; its humor is 
its suffering.
cleverness appearing during the mourning of the mourning of 
objects and their inscription; cleverness is always under 
erasure.
look closely at cleverness, and the corporate shyly appears; 
cleverness is the product and production of the sponsored world.
cleverness is likely likely; cleverness is amusing.


indix

indix.mp4 at http://www.alansondheim.org/indix.mp4 is an index,
indices, indication of attempts at video of For Sasha; each and
every one is arbitrary but designed to bring out other aspects
of the structure; rather than sending these snippets directly
to the trash I thought it would be best to assemble them as yet
another and final take of the slurry and cubic decomposition -



TEST MESSAGING THE VIRTUAL IN THE TAP FOR CYPOSIUM

It's dangerous to consider the virtual as a brave new world; the 
virtual has always been with us. The lure is the supposition that 
it engenders the potential of eternity, and escape from pain and 
death. In the meantime, the physical world is the Disaster of the 
Anthropocene. We must look, with open eyes, at the obdurate nature 
of the Real, through any means possible. We must accept our own 
deaths. I will discuss my work in virtual worlds and performance 
(with the collaboration of others) in this regard.
