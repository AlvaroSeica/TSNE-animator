Parable


One day Izanagi and Nikuko were walking in the vicinity of Nara. They
passed a market full of merchants from Honshu and Silla, busy with their
wares. The clattering of soroban filled the air. When we count, said
Nikuko, we use our fingers up to twelve. And after twelve, asked Izanagi.
We count by by shells to one-hundred-twenty, Nikuko replied. Thereafter to
five-hundred-forty, we consider bamboo stalks, and after that, to roughly
two-thousand, we use rice-plants, that their yield may be great. Izanagi
asked again, and after two-thousand. There are lacquer boxes to four-thou-
sand-three-hundred, Nikuko said, and after that, scrolls to ten-thousand,
that we may properly observe the rites and rituals. After that, there is
only the counting by numbers and words, that goes nowhere, and means noth-
ing. There is a certain truth in that, said Izanagi. There are a number of
bamboo stalks in them, replied Nikuko.
