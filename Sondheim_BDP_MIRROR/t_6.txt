talker mulling


the telephone is always a summoning, a calling in the Weberian sense, 
what one us un/toward. Pavlovian, one reacts even to the purified _ring_
of the instrument emerging from the radio or television.
my voice inadvertently engages your own. they share the same acoustic 
space, the space of _you,_ stumbling across one another.
grains are offered among us, Barthes' grain of the voice.
grains are dissolutions, the uncanny in Ronell, the ghost caught in 
Aycock's work.
between the grain and the vacuum, the voice. 
on Iphone, the voice, swirling.
<Tiffany:1> but it is never disembodied, read-through.
<ClaraHielo:2> but it is replete, fecund, i imagine us together
<Tiffany:1> dwelling in the maternal imaginary
<ClaraHielo:2> summoning which reproduces the hearth
<Tiffany:1> always a risk and a danger
<ClaraHielo:2> Levinas, Yhwh churning in the bush
the secret of the voice: it is never an image.
beyond representation, the voice is never written, not even it speech, 
nor what has placed as contents, directives, performatives, statement.
<Tiffany:1> altogether of the other.
<ClaraHielo:2> others, grains, all together.
silence falls in the square. I-Phaedra _sings._
talker, mulling
