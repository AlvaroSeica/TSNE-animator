Waiting

 

_attente_/ writing



Tumult of anxiety provoked by waiting for the loved being, subject to 

trivial delays (rendezvous, letters, telephone calls, returns).



1.  I am waiting for an arrival, a return, a promised sign. This can be 

futile, or immensely pathetic: in _Erwartung (Waiting),_ a woman waits 

for her lover, at night, in the forest; I am waiting for no more than a 

telephone call, but the anxiety is the same. Everything is solemn: I have 

no sense of _proportions._
