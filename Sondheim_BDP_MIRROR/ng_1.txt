       
       
       if the creation of the one is simultaneously the 
       annihilation of the other and the other is linked 
       to the one, such as the annihilation of the one is 
       the creation of the other - then there is no need 
       of the space and time of the one or the space and 
       time of the other. annihilation falls in the slow 
       film of water against the pane of existence; 
       creation builds across the layered sheets of ice 
       as if these were inscribed with all debate and 
       method.
       
       ice in numerous great sheets into sheaves, sheaves 
       into bundled sheaves, through the pane everything 
       is written, creation and annihilation, 
       annihilation and creation.
       
       if this is so, nikuko, then that is so, and if 
       that is so, nikuko, then this is so.
       
       about annihilation and creation, about the sheaves 
       and panes, they do not speak, nor have they a time 
       or place to speak.
       
       time into rhyme, place into space.

where is my book and my book head

the ruined billboards of our imagination.
i want to hold my book in the air like an object held in the air.
the planet is already trashed and we are already trashed.
my book will have the weight of a jerome r book
and the astuteness of a maria d and miekal a book.
it will have the height of a pierre j book
it will have the soul of a catherine d book and the edge of a kari 
e book. i did not mean this line to run over like this.
the joy and viva la viva of ana b and geoffrey g.
the delineations and coruscations is this a word.
of mez and florian c. florian c where are you now. there are many
who have betrayed me but i will not grant them a hearing at this 
juncture. that was supposed to be on the previous line.

Hello most loving person alan alan whom I have known it seems forever. Do
you remember the first time... Remember when you called on me... Well... I
am still here trying to help you! I hate to give up on you! When you
requested information I promised to help you. I know that information will
be very helpful to your lifestyle and skills set. But more important, I
know that it will be very important to you and Azure and Azure and Azure
and Azure and Azure5 and will be very important to her lifestyle and
skills set. I know you 5 can be very happy together. I will help make you
very happy but you must let me make you very happy. On my own and by
myself I cannot make you very happy well can I. Of course not. Do you
remember when you called on me for... Well I still want to help you. But I 
can't help you unless you want me to help you. Then I can send you people. 
I can't do anything unless you allow me to send you people.

I really hate to give up on you!

It is so easy for me to help you  5. I am sure Azure and Azure and Azure 
and Azure and Azure5 want me to help you. Please let me help you write 
now. It's ridiculous but I can't help you unless you let me help you will 
you let me help you. Do you know how absurd this is? You must let me help 
you.

I haven't given up on you  5 and you 6. I so much want to help you. I was 
born to help you with your life style and skillset. Well I still do want 
that.

(to Poetics in response to a thread) - 

I don't know if I have any overt illness; after the mess at Florida Inte-
rnational and for the first time I began taking anti-depressants, ending
with lexapro. My depressions are furious and just beneath the surface;
they're triggered by - among other things - external factors such as mass
animal/plant extinctions, my inability to support myself at this point,
lack of community acceptance; they're triggered by - among other things -
external factors such as my family background, obsessive-compulsive neuro-
physiologies, extreme insomnia and violent nightmares, the holocaust of
daily life, the truth of the fasco-fundamentalist regime we're subjected
to, real and unreal illnesses, the feeling that death is close at hand;
they're triggered by - among other things - external factors such as my
current readings and writings, the drive of ambition and the drive towards
eternity; they're triggered by - among other things - external factors
such as the constant desire to reveal the truth, to bear witness, to be as
good as I can with Azure, to help others whenever I can, my memories which
are always incriminating, my regrets which begin at birth, my guilt
descending to the very essence of life, my inordinate fear of the false
teething and truths of the absolute, the abyss, a journey forgotten upon
its completion - upon the instant of its completion - so much bandwidth;
they're triggered by - among other things - external factors such as the
enormous waste of it all, the exhaustion that comes with the constant
pretense towards meaning, the long unraveling.

I am a boy afraid of losing writing.

i have never seen the other side of the hill.
i have no idea what is on the other side.
i can't see into the ground unless a squirrel digs a very wide hole.

i am not sure when i lose a part of myself but i am sometimes

strange energies

this machine lies old and cracked in the garbage. the desk has collapsed
and no longer supports anything. my hands are shattered bones. the walls
of this building leave small traces in the earth overgrown with weeds. the
fabric of the chair has decayed and its frame rusted. my sweater has
disappeared. the air has shifted. the copper pipes lie in a tangled heap.
the trees have moved on. there are different elements. my glasses are
buried in the muck. the keyboard has been recycled into annihilation. the
sounds are screaming and unknown. the wiring is broken into pieces. light 
radiates nowhere. the christmas tree has turned to dust. my eyes are eaten 
out. my partner lies dead among me. unknown radiations screech through the 
atmosphere. winds bring difference. the pair of scissors is twisted miles 
from here. the sink is overturned deep below the surface of the bround. 
the keyboard is smashed and silent. the electric fan has corroded down to 
the level of the interior rotor. the hard drive has bent beyond 
recognition. the junked couch is nothing but rusted springs. different 
clouds gather here. the remains of the cat have been completely devoured. 
the edo chest has recycled into different plants. the model woodie with 
its tiny surfboard has disappeared. the windows are smashed beyond 
recognition. the bed has been junked and buried. my arms are broken into 
pieces. the cars are shattered bones. the neck has collapsed and no longer 
supports anything. the city is overgrown with weeds. my clothes are buried 
in the muck. the smashed abacus lies empty and beadless. the television 
has recycled into different plants. sound radiates nowhere. the radio has 
been completely devoured. the video tapes are smashed beyond recognition.
