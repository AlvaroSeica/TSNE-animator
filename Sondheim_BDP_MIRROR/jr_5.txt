SPIRITD-L is a _fully-moderated_ email list for the dead. In order to
post, you must send to the comoderator, sondheim@jen-alan.com, proof
that you are dead - either an obituary in a legitimate newspaper, or a
copy, hopefully notarized, of the death certificate itself. 

This list is a discussion group for after-life experiences of all sorts.
While there may be few subscribers, we hope that the resources of the
Internet, and in particular, the Web, will function as a "Tibetan ghost-
trap," contacting any spirits that behave with a suitable _trembling_ in
the presence of a URL.

Recent topics include: I go right through my keyboard; Bereavement and
Love; Color-blindness and Links in HTML; Death and Community; Spirit
Gender; Narratology of the Corpse; Is the Death of God the Death of Me;
and Mac or PC, Interfaces Beyond the Grave. (There are also the usual
"kill" and delete-key jokes.) 

The list traffic tends to be extremely heavy at times, since participants
often have little else to do. Digest is available. Archives, in consider-
ation of the living, will not be kept.

Comoderator (dead): Karl Kraus, KrausK@jen-alan.com
Comoderator (living): Alan Sondheim, sondheim@jen-alan.com
