tomorrow does not exist; nations are falling apart or cathecting 
boundaries in the face of distributive networking; france no long exists;
we is no longer a collectivity or communality; war is not found but 
created; the innocent no longer exist; if iraq did not exist, it would 
have been created; iraq has not been found; iraq is just days away; 
truth is no longer; nations cannot speak; food does not exist;
