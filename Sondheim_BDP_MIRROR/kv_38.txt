Read "Snow"


There are many flakes to the snow.
Every one is unlike every two others.
The two others dance around what is called "one."
The "one" huddles and cuddles with itself.
This is called identity.

Snow witnesses our "identity."
Our "identity" witnesses the "identity" of every flake.
I cannot take my eye from the window!

I do so love "identity."
You can see through every flake, but you can't see through the snow!
This is what is called "metaphysics."
It is all about the "one."
There are two flakes of snow dancing over there.
I cannot stop reading!
