music of the spheres
without it there's nothing at all
there are intensities and each music
has its notes and plateaus and each
according to its rhythm

the enunciation of the body
along with the music of the sphere
an allegiance always troubling
when you can't think but only sing

where are the dark equations
holding plasma and ocean in check
against sounds i am living
and song rendering my life in silence

the misery of music
lips sewn, thought locked against thought

music of the spheres

without it there's without 
there's all nothing there are
intensities and are each intensity 
has its notes its plateaus
and according to rhythm

enunciation body 
enunciation along along spheres 
the allegiance always troubling

when can't you think but think 
only but sing only where dark 
where equations are holding
plasma in and check ocean

against sounds i am 
against living sounds and song 
and rendering song 
my life 

my silence in misery 
thought locked against thought

music of the spheres
without it there's nothing at all
there are intensities 
and each has its notes 
plateaus according to rhythm
enunciation body
along with sphere
an allegiance always troubling
when you can't think but only sing
where dark equations
holding plasma ocean in check
against sounds i am living
song rendering my life silence
misery lips sewn, 
thought locked intensity,
dismal thought
