What surrounds these -


Notation on these recent texts which are almost-narratives, or al-
most-narratives which _tend towards_ textuality - as a way of explora-
tion/explanation - what I would want to say to you (if I could only
speak) (clearly) (I can't) (*)

The narratives are _broken,_ torn in the middle (Nikuko, torn); they
        return through a discourse on _language and matter_ -
What is the matter with matter - the non-practical-inert or effluvia -
        think of _emergent debris_ - upwelling, as if there were a
        _moment_ of language and silence (I know there's not) -
So then think of the _coughing or choking of language,_ or think of
        the _language of the throat_ - those uneasy areas where death
        might ascend, where the _sign_ might (appear to) be given
        from _on high_ - as if there were _height_ involved -
The _returning_ or _recuperation_ of language, self-reflexivity of
        language, text, narrative - as if there were a _conjuring-
        trick,_ (levitation or game or strategy or the _cutting of a
        woman in two, making her whole again_) - as if there were a
        _disappearance of sense_ - as if someone might emerge, _mute_
        in relation to the sign -
The _returning_ or _recuperation_ of language, self-reflexivity of
        language, text, narrative - as if there were a _conjuring-
        trick,_ the act of _being clever, cleverness,_ skimming
        across the exfoliations of "clever's structure" -
Or the recuperation of the _materiality_ disguised by cleverness -
        the obdurate of the sign, what holds the sign, say, on the
        sign-post - what posts the sign to you -
And _to or for_ the purpose of exploring a territory which refuses
        the return of inscription (as in "a good return for the in-
        vestment"), for example - I can't return (myself), that is,
        I can't make sense (as if there were sense to be made), as
        if inscription were obtuse, as if muteness could be displaced
        (itself) into a _sign_ -
So the machinery exploring those portions of the world not given unto
        man or woman, or those portions which appear on the periphery
        of dreams, or those portions of the imaginary _about to rise,
        coagulate,_ on the level of the symbolic - but not quite -
This narrative's having troubles getting organized - it's as if you
        can't follow it, but the cleverness, say, of the author,
        perhaps a foreclosing on the _truth of the world,_ or a de-
        flection (that's what it is, a deflection or entertainment) -
        not a deconstruction, but an addition of the same, or an addi-
        tion of a _difference_ which refuses to be accounted for,
        enumerated, even _legible_ -
