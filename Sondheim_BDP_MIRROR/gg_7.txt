Origins of the Internet, Part cxviii:

"The _Lothardi_ devised an even more peculiar dogma in the fourteenth
century. They declared that men should lead a moral life - as long as
they were above ground. But three _ellen_ (an _elle_ was the equivalent
of about seven-tenths of a yard) underground, the rules of morality lap-
sed. Therefore they held their meetings underground and conducted horri-
ble orgies: wild flagellation, every sexual perversion, murder, and sui-
cide were among the usual highlights of their gatherings."
