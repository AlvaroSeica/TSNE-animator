i am writing you now, and writing everyone, here and now,
this is the condition of everyone, i am given to see it,
now suspended 8 kilometers above the pacific ocean, you see
this 'condition' which is the 'condition' of all of us,
irrevocable, embedded, no matter that wars come and go,
no matter that planes crash, oceans boil, worlds disappear
into nervous energy, this is _it_, this condition which
we observe, suspension, and on my nervous horizon you are there,
beneath, say, a tree rooted in the ground, or ceiling rooted in the sky,
beneath, say, a sky rooted in the ground, or ceiling elsewhere, speak,
speak, from one moment of this planet to any other, i am overhead
in the ceiling, against the sky, flattened, the paste of vertigo,
what would be me long forgotten in this metal tank thrown upward
for a certain interval, you know we are always in love with the land,
you know the land curls around us, and we are long gone into it,
so i carry your seed within me which has given birth to me,
so i carry your sky, and when i am beneath you, i cannot see stars,
or sun or autumn moon, you are there, you there, you are there,
it is so ever thin, it curls, caresses me, now we pass tahiti,
central malaysia, indonesia, africa and australia, now we are overhead
and curled, like a vector loving this spacetime, i am so very
hot for you, thinned air and atmosphere, nervous weather writing you,
clouds and dusk and stratosphere, writing you for me,
this condition of the modern human, this perfect pure here.

Having arrived at the Nagoya airport, I find everyone diligently watching
a cooking show on wide-screen tv. My computer case strap released this
instrument to a happily waiting ground.
