for Carol Novack

http://www.alansondheim.org/blanking.mp4

I was working on this, shot with Foofwa d'Imobilite at Eyebeam,
when I heard the news that Carol Novack had died. for many of us,
this was unexpected and awful, as if the year couldn't end 
without just one more tragedy. Foofwa and I had talked about our
work together, earlier, about issues of pain, wounding, death; 
I think this piece, made at the time, is all I could do, I speak
through image and sound, these words already lost, resting in
peace

thank you Foofwa and Jamie and Jackson at Eyebeam

this just happened and I was thrown out of the game-space, into the game, 
what was the game, it was the game of life, who was playing, it was alan 
dojoji and julu twine, what was the game, it was moaning and singing and 
warning and trembling, what was the vision, it was clear and acute, it was 
dark and dusty and I, I was thrown out of the game-space and into the 
game, and what was the game, it was the game of song, and who was singing 
the song, it was the game-space, the game-space was singing the song, into 
the game, into and around the game, and the game was playing the game, it 
was blurry and obscure, it was light and obdurate, and it was so so clean, 
and it was I, I was thrown into the game space, and out of the game, it 
was the game of being the game, and the game was being the game, and this 
just happened, no one was playing, and it was speaking and saying, 
inviting and trembling, and what was the song, where was the song, it was 
in the game, it was not in the game-space, my lips puckered like a broken 
womb, bearing, born, my lips gathered like a broken mouth, hearing, shorn, 
and it was dusty and obdurate, so clean, so blurry, so played, so played 
out



the murmur and breathing *

http://www.alansondheim.org/radhu.wav

of something just outside the potential of a sphere
caught in a mesmeric or ectoplasmic field...

i remember the sound, somewhat, a kind of murmuring from a 
vietnamese oboe, lowered in pitch, the over-recording
transformed into a form of breathing, the whole becoming-
an-animal like myself, a musing or shuffling, or a jostling,
but of notes and spatial magnitudes of unbearable beauty 

http://www.alansondheim.org/iamperfect.mp4

a rough patch or rough spot. something rough in the narrative.
uncompromising. something about perfect. i could hardly hear
him. the storm...

i remember the cube with the voice announcing perfect, as if
it were impossible to speak in the grey dawn, when only
bandages held the limbs together, it might have been after 
sex, or after a war, or an overpowering examination, this
untoward chanting of a mantra, i am perfect, i am perfect, 
when everything, in the cold grey dawn, spilled otherwise
