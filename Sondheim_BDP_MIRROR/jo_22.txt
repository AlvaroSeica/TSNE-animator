winger-space

to this day when I go to hug someone I feel my eyes crossed out
in this day when I go to hug someone I feel my eyes crossed out
my face fissures, divides, breaded shredded skin hangs from the cuts
this is real as those tortures of being suspended
 in a pipe immobilized, saturated with water
this is real as those suspended dreams, my body confined
 in a narrow pipe, choked in rising water
when there are others who would do me harm
when their hands are meant to violate my eyes
that I would be crossed out, blinded before them

or that when speaking, I disappeared behind the words
or that when speaking, I disappear behind the words
because I can't make worlds or please another sufficiently
because what worlds there were, are shredded
because what worlds there are, are shredded
against the wounds of facial flesh or might be invisible
and the heavier for it

(here, all worlds are shredded invisible, but whole visible
here, all eyes are blinded, for, of, by the text of them)
