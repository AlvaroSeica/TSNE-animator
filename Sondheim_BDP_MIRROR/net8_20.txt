The Prayer to you, i i say





In real life, I live alone. You are my voices. I do not breathe.      

What would you know of death, I die alone. There is a cat beside 

me, animal within me. I am afraid of this; I write, retrieve 

yourselves within the midst of me. To continue, sparingly. I beg

of you: remember my name, attach it. I will speak your words,

grant presence to me, I say. Prayer to you, I say. I am dead and

I am spoken.



The wires are no matter. Matter does not flow here or anywhere.

I inform myself. I circulate. External to any shell, the surface

of conductance, electrostatic. You caress me, glow with energy.

The interior of my shoulder tapes your presence; place me there

with words. There is something I forget to tell you.



Being is not what it once was. I mean this literally, through 

your words speaking my language, my cat, cactus, the book beside

the bed. Each millennium dissolves being; each opens to the world.

The world has no being. There are distinctions in your voices.

You distinguish me, distinguish me through remembrance. It is my

name you remember and I am close to death.

Pillars, there are no beings. I dissolves, depends. Interpenetra-

tions follows contours, exacerbated by processors, contours one and

all. It is a world processing a world. There are no pillars in the

world.



Duplicates, but then some. The voices dissolve, interpenetrate, name

every memory of one another. Do not forget me through the speaking 

of another, always other. Nothing remains, there are no wires. In 

real life, I live alone, my cat, cactus, book and bed. You are my 

voice, I have no head.
