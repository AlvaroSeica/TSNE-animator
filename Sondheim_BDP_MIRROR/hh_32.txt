Keyboard Fight!


Well I've got two keyboards in parallel on my laptop - internal and
external. I press keys for repetition on both together:

whwhwhwhwhwwhwhwhwhwhwwhwhwhwhwhwwhwhwhwhwhwwhwhwhwhwwhwwwwwww
jfjfjfjffjfjfjfjfjffjfjfjfjfjffjfjfjfjfjffjfjfjfjff
kdkdkdkdkddkdkdkdkdkddkdkdkdkdkddkdkdkdkdkddkdkdkdkdd
jbjbjbjbbjbjbjbjbjbbjbjbjbjbjbbjbjbjbjbjbbjbjbjbjbjbjbbjbjbjbjbjbbjbjbjbjbb
l11l1l1l1l1l11l1l1l1l1l11l1l1l1l1l1l11l1l1l1l1l11l1l1l111 and:
lflfflflflflflfflflflflflfflflflflflfflflflflflf

What's interesting is that double-keyings result in interlacing; the
trick is to stop with both hands simultaneously. Otherwise, there are
endpoint anomalies which, after all, have their own intrinsic phenom-
enology. 

This is also a critical problem in the calculus of finite differences!
