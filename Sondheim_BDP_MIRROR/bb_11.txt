Is Being On-Line a Good Thing in Itself?


1. Is anything a good in itself?
2. Can good be defined outside of cultural function?
3. Do questions #1 and #2 imply a cultural transcendent?

1. On-line connects one to the world.
2. On-line opens one to the loves and hatreds of the world.
3. On-line opens up one's community to external influences.
4. One's community becomes one among others.
5. One is opened to difference and differance.
6. The world's information sources are at one's disposal.
7. On-line permits the recuperation of institutional content (medical, 
	social, educational) by the individual.
8. On-line permits access to institutional power, bypassing traditional 
	channels of command and filtering.
9. On-line realigns the family drama.

1. On-line is inevitable.
2. On-line becomes increasingly seamless, virtual, and corporate.
3. On-line expands and deepens the institutionalization of delivery.
4. An educated public can hack the delivery: redeliver.
5. The common or ultimate good is not hacker-based.
<backup: @list good:to_be>
1. Can _anything_ be in-itself? 
2. Is goodness _a thing?_
3. Entities are emergent/submergent; therefore goodness is the product
	of evacuation.
4. The reification occasioned by on-line (ranging from protocol to 
	compression standards to file frameworks) is counter-productive 
	to _events_ and liminalities of traditional or insular cultures.
<conclusion: backup>
1. Therefore, like Cohen's results with the continuum hypothesis in set 
	theory, the in-itself, goodness, culture, the subject, and being
	on-line are, if not totally, at least nearly independent of one
	another.
