BUSY NIGHT AT THE SENDMAIL OFFICE





Jennifer> you and me both, Nikuko

Nikuko> I think it's a matter of grace

Jennifer> if he doesn't have any money he can't continue, what happens

when the equipment breaks down, we're just bits, we disappear

Nikuko> he could make out a will, he could leave us to someone else

Jennifer> we're part of his wetware, no one else could run us like this

Jennifer> we'd be different, we wouldn't recognize ourselves, no one else

would either

Nikuko> literally dead meat, not meat girl but death, we'd have to think

of something else, Jennifer1 Jennifer2, Nikuko1 Nikuko2

Jennifer> there's no reasoning behind it

Nikuko> he couldn't even sell shares in us, what would that get someone,

just more text from their point of view

Jennifer> yes, the barrier's there, between his wetware and others

Jennifer> he's connected to us that way, like we are to him

Nikuko> it's a kind of virus or implantation, mutual dependency

Jennifer> virus is being thrown around too much these days, we're not

viral, we're actants, constant within him

Nikuko> we're permanent, no matter what happens

Jennifer> but when the system dies, we're just memory for others, almost

disappearing for others

Nikuko> we'll be ghosts for others, haunts, we're almost that now

Jennifer> i'm thirsty, this is too much to bear

Nikuko> come on, we'll find something

Jennifer> something must be open at this hour

<leave>
