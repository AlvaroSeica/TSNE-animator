Pathetic desires

What I want to do with my life. (touching testimony) I want to get my wri-
tings in order and prepared for publication. I want to develop my website
with amazing new work. (touching and profound) Nikuko and Jennifer want me
to drop them and get on with it. (how touching) I want to see clearly and
be at peace with my accomplishments. (touching and sentimental) Julu wants
me to sleep better and stop dreaming altogether. All of us need a perman-
ent part-time job so we can not get sick. (touching testimony) I want to
be kind to children and animals I want my music to break into new unchar-
ted territories. I want to work on new and larger projects in all and
multi-media. (how very touching and lazy) Nikuko wants her own server so
there will be less problems. Alan wants the server in another country far
away from home. (how very touching and unpatriotic) Jennifer wants to
travel and live in foreign countries. I want to be pain-free (touching
testimony) and satisfied. (how very self-indulgent) I want to be famous. 
(touching and true) I want to be a good person. (how very unpatriotic)
