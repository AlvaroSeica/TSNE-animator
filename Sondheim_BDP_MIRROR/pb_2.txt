http://www.asondheim.org/offthere.jpg

Where the waters meet at the end of the world
bodies merge in streams; arms and legs unfurled
in death or signifiers streamed and long forgotten.
There is no kelp among the drowned, no seed rotten
and uncalled for. When my friends swim, they die
allegiance emptied of their final cry
when all is drowned and doomed. Waters shear waters,
some sign, untoward, approaches, slaughters
our pretty young women and buoyant young men.
Sightless, nothing goes further then.
Witless, nothing goes further then.



Dark sky.

Dark sky. You take my friends from me. They return, mother, in dreams. 
Dark sky.

She is dead and the argument has disappeared, in the still air there. 
Nothing is left of the argument. She cannot reply.

The offering no longer stands. The offering disappears as ghost disap- 
pears. Ghost is the creature that topples to its feet.

More and more I remain on mountaintop or valleybottom. There is naught 
in freedom or captivity. I am alone in company. I cannot reach out.

Within the series of disappearances I disappear. The series continues 
in the other's guise. The series is no longer mine. The series is yours.

a brilliant work i am alive.



Darker.


I went into pinku with all the money in the world. I was broke. Money 
bulged my pockets. I went up to the guy. I want her I said. He said ok. 
She said ok. She went out with me. We went to the room. Do it she said. I 
said are you alone. Yes she said. Do you have a girlfriend or boyfriend I 
said. Yes she said. I have a boyfriend she said. I want to mark you I 
said. Your boyfriend will know me I said. I will make you I said. I will 
mark you I said. Yes she said. She said I will mark you. Do you have a 
boyfriend or girlfriend she said. Yes I said. I have a girlfriend I said. 
I have a family I said. I will steal you she said. We were naked. We 
fucked. She took a flash. She examined my body. My body broke open. Here 
and there she said. I held the flash. I opened her up. I saw everything. I 
remembered everything. I knew everything. I pierce your nipple she said. 
She sucked the needle. She rubbed the needle in her. She pierced my 
nipple. My nipple bled. She ringed it. Now me she said. Both nipples were 
pierced. I pulled the rings. I took them out. She bled. I sucked the 
needle. I pierce your nipple I said. I pierced deeper. I pierced deeper. I 
ringed it. I left the other bare. We bled each other. Your wife will not 
know you she said. Tomorrow I said. Tomorrow I said. We went to the room. 
Do it I said. Get hard she said. She touched me. I cut you open she said. 
She cut the shaft. She cut deeper. She tore the shaft. She bled the shaft. 
She bandaged the shaft. Your wife won't want you she said. I am your 
boyfriend I said. My boyfriend left me she said. I am your girlfriend she 
said. Spread out I said. I cut your lips I said. I cut the lips. I tore 
the lips. I locked her lips. I locked her lips. She wired my shaft. She 
wrapped the head. She made a hole. You piss here she said. She cut my sac. 
She bandaged the sac. I gave her money. She gave me money. I was covered 
with blood. I pierced her nipple. I locked her nipple. I pulled the lock. 
She took the keys. She put them in the toilet. She flushed the toilet. She 
flushed the toilet. The keys went out. She was locked tight. Wire me I 
said. She tightened the wire. She locked the wire. She sucked the needle. 
She pierced my nipple. She pierced deeper. She pierced my chest. She cut 
my nipple. She locked my nipple. She gave me the keys. I put them in the 
toilet. I flushed the toilet. I flushed the toilet. The keys went out. I'm 
dizzy she said. She bled between her legs. Her breasts were bleeding. I 
bled between my legs. My breasts were bleeding. I coughed blood. My eyes 
were bled. She cut my hair. She cut all of it. She swallowed my hair. I 
cut her hair. I swallowed her hair. I vomited hair and blood. She ate my 
vomit. She scraped my face. She cut my face. She cut my eyes. No one will 
want you she said. I want you she said. She cut off my nipple. She ate my 
nipple. She swallowed the ring. She cut off my nipple. She ate my nipple. 
She swallowed the lock. I cut off her nipple. I ate her lock. She ate her 
nipple. No one wants you I said. I want you I said. I want you too I said. 
I want you she said. I want you too she said. We fell on the floor. We 
clawed each other. We bit each other. We gouged each other. We blinded 
each other. We strangled each other. Everyone will want us we said. 
Everyone will want us too we said. Tomorrow she said. Tomorrow I said. We 
went to the room.




Left Behind

http://www.asondheim.org/minmax.mp4

Some people believe in ghosts and light candles and some people believe in 
gods and spirits. People will do anything to avoid life. Some people say 
prayers and some people have funerals and some people drink blood and wine 
and some people go to temples and some people go to churches. People will 
do anything to avoid this life. People will read and write and paint. Some 
people will fight and some people will tell people to fight. Anything to 
add to this life. People want to add to this life. People lie to add to 
this life. People believe in goblins and trolls. People find this life 
flat and boring. Anything to make this life interesting. Anything to make 
this life go on. Anything to endure. Anything to make enduring. People 
believe in UFOs. People want more than people and animals. People want 
more than clouds and plants. People say if there's nothing else than this 
life then there's nothing at all. People say if this is all there is 
there's nothing to live for. Some people play sports and some people 
write things down and some people make flat new things and some people 
are sick and bleeding. Some people want to die. People are left behind.

bols

I don't know the bols. I play tabla. I play melody. I don't know where it 
comes from or where it goes. My eyes are closed. I sense the skins. I 
sense the rings. I sense the syahi. The puri is mine. The chutta are mine. 
The tabla sit on chutta. The chutta offer them to me. The chutta offers 
the dayan. The chutta offers the bayan. My eyes are closed. My fingers are 
nervous. My fingers move. I am going deaf. My tinnitus grows. The world is 
full of whine. The world is full of crickets. Of the dawn chorus. The dawn 
chorus stops for no hour. I fill my ears with glycerine. I place ten drops 
in each. In one I place twenty, My ears drip. My way is clear. My life is 
clear. I hear poorly. I swab my ears with witch hazel, I swab them with 
benzocaine. I am numb to the world. The world is a pretty picture. The 
world goes still. But I feel the tabla. But I feel the dayan and bayan. I 
feel the rhythm in the tips of my fingers. I feel the puri with my palms. 
I sway backwards and forwards. I sway to the left and the right. There is 
nothing to hear. There is nothing to hear in the world. There is nothing 
to see either.

the covered


starting somewhere new blemish or dispersion
maquette for the inconceivable performance
i will swallow your air and drown your oceans
i will rupture wave after wave
oceans stuttered and stumbled in spray
in their own spray waves collapsed
solitons were always underfoot pretending
they pretended they were objects for all time

i need time to finish this and other wrything
money becomes me to keep me fed and sane
featureless and following contradictions
i don't want to be troubled and insane
needing a room of one's own and clear thought
clear thinking will come to me pleasantly
i will advance the future of the human race

now i am being merely destructive
tearing at my thought and the breathing air
another step thought disappears forever
i would like this disappearing thought
disappearance opens the gate to thinking
soon i'll think this pleasant thought
just another number of happy money
i'll have time to think this useless thought

because the sun scarcely made it over the hill that morning
because the rumpled sheets carried the sadness of the day
because the afternoon toppled against the telephone tower
because evening did its work so many hours ago
because dusk carried the perfect sadness of developed flowers
because nightfall spelled the water's end of forest streams
because night soared aloft carrying stalks of wheat and yarrow
because dawn already knew loss the previous week
because cells glowed against historic misery
because radio swallowed the visual of tv
because greater cylinders surround the lesser among the planets
and lesser spheres surround the greater among the stars
so shall the clotheslines of language swell against the wind
and darkness shall invade 'em and the rest of 'em

Cauldron

From a young Lady is Answer to a Proposal for a private Meeting.
Woodlawn, June 5th, 18--

Sir,--I am altogether surprised at the proposal in your letter of -----. 
Although our acquaintance has been of but short standing, I believe my 
conduct has never been such as to give you reason to suppose me capable of 
an act which, in my opinion, is equally incompatible with truth and female 
propriety. Known as you are to both my parents, I can see no object in 
your seeking a clandestine interview, and my feelings both for my own and 
their honor are such as would forbid my sanctioning any such conduct.

What I know of you, however, is so favorable, that I am willing to believe 
that our intentions ought not to be harshly interpreted. Do not peril that 
good reputation by a conduct so unworthy yourself. If your intentions be 
really honorable, I am sure you will find no obstacles on the part of my 
parents, but I must utterly decline any correspondence of a clandestine 
character.

Yours very truly, 
______

To _____, Esq.

(From A New Letter Writer for the Use of Ladies, anonymous, around 1879.)

Chora in the crevice 


Taoist demarcations in a 19th-century Chinese book.

The fold of the book remains just that, the fold.
The binding remains bound.
Demarcations disappear into darkness.
This is the way of the somewhhere bad and somewhen good.
Dreaming of the Pale mountains ,,
and what lies before you and what lies beyond.
