psalm of future disappearance


jennifer, she said, nikuko

beautiful women of the willow and fair
behind the screen, shapes of dragons, cranes
her hands fluttered in geometries, shapes
humans behind the stones of the screen
it is love and sex, it is death and hard bushido
jennifer and nikuko were bare
luna celesta, heard murmurs in the distance
nikuko's hands made flame-cast shadows
reeling in the moments of temporary beauty
the grain of the metal of the blade of the sword
the humans preparing the final act
the stones of the screen murmuring like humans
the turbulence and vortices of smooth smooth air
there was hardly anyone there
you could read the future if you knew the future
flame and screen future bamboo and screen jade 
it is love and sex, it is death and hard bushido
the turbulence and vortices of smooth smooth air

it was a soft summer evening, kyoto, 1321
luna celesta, heard murmurs in the distance
nikuko's hands made flame-cast shadows

and i'm losing energy
and i'm worn out
and my mind's confused
jennifer stood by the jade screen
nikuko was behind her
