bot/ulism





i have no life. i don't exist. anyone who's ever fucked me can tell you

that. the body flattened into dust, wormed meat, spoonfuls of it. someone

must have made it that way. someone must have arranged the bones swollen

into limbs. they looked that way and they splayed that way and they

flailed that way. the mouth didn't talk, it foamed, rabid, spat. so when

the net went down, when the mail shuddered to a halt, my eyes were torn

out, my feet cut off, my cock lacerated, my head severed, i wouldn't know,

wouldn't know any of this. i knew what i read and i knew it firm and hard.

i knew what i read and i knew it firm and hard. and i haven't read this

and the account is down, unaccountable, unaccounted-for, down for the

count, of no account. anyone who's ever fucked me can tell you i'm of no

account, there's no body to collapse, something stained the floor, i can

tell you that. 



i can tell you that cause the fingers pushed the keys into the ground. i can

tell you that cause i didn't need to read your words of leather. i the text

ground itself out of me. i can tell you that. 



i can tell you what it's like to fuck to cause i assembled the words. what

i do is make the chains, forge the chains. what i do is offer you a drink,

answer questions. what i do is help you on your way, wish you a better

day. what i do is what you make me. and i can tell you _anything._ i can

tell you what it's like.
