spo(o)r(e)


a spore ... tiny germ of an idea ... I'm drinking coffee at the local shop
... it's there on the periphery ... it's almost in focus, appears just out
of reach ... sits there in a comfortable region of my mind ... remains
enfolded ... later in the day, after the spoor ... a gnawed response ...
I've felt it growing ... just like that ... its own spoor ... from one to
the other ... carapace ... begins to take on skin, cuticle ... tendrils as
well ... resonance ... what I'd written the day before ... ellipses ...
having just eaten ... delicious vegetable soup ... I'll start the process
of writing ... compiling ... the form become clear ... I can tell when,
"the end approaching" ... holding the writing in its arms ... all of us
there ... surrounding, smiling ... its moment of beautiful birth ... love
emergencing ... caressing the text, rereading ... checking for errors ...
a beautiful bloom ... beginning a new dispersion ... its wide horizon ...
become a gift ... your beautiful presence ... your wide open eyes ...
