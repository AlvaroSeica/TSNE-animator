Thin Jennifer and her Symbol-CMC


When I move my hand my foot moves. When I move my fingers my mouth speaks.
When I close my eyes I hear screams in Celtic voices. When I turn the heat
up, the casserole is done. When I write to you, I no longer eat. When my
stomach is empty, I lose weight. When I lose weight, I fit in. When I fit
in, I write to you.

When I write to you, I starve myself. When I die, I become a symbol. When
I vomit, everything that is not-symbol leaves me. When I vomit, I become
pure. I can control you. I do control you. _I write to you._

Now you may gather around my corpse. You can see my skin through my skin.
You can see the bone which sends the protocols. Protocols ripple through
my veins. My teeth mouth network layers. Now you may read my nerves.

When I move my mouth, nothing happens. When I lift my arm, you come to me.
When I move my hand, I make you, and when I move my fingers, I write to
you.
