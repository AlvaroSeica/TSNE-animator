	Pre Net.Sex 1990

	Flattened against the rim of your clitoris,
	its stem flowered within the teeth and lip
	of me and you, the mouth descends and showers
	between labia swollen with slow dark streams;
	and everything that was, or will be, is.
	Eyes press on liquid septum; they dip,
	enfold and drink, see night; your body's fevered
	hours are now my own. The mouth surrounds, the body
	dreams, inhales urethral showers, hot waves ascending
	from thigh to hip, flows between the breasts to neck,
	from tongue and back, salt eyes descending into
	tears. The anus burns, opens wide; a murdered speck
	returns into the light. There are no more of me,
	no more of you. There are none of the mountains.
	There are none. Where blood meets blood, nothing dies;
	clitoris swells, I breath it hard between the lids
	of sight. The mouth devours. Somewhere cries are lost
	against the skin. Everywhere is in.
