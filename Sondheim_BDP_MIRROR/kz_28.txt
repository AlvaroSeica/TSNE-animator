gratitude toward authors


and j g suicide down by the river, gratitude towards authors, after doing
ichikawa no reason to do so celan does it all abjection of violette leduc
how could i do you nicole brossard does nothing to do after j g ballard
but what do you think zeami does of my angst and angels rilke who does and
holderlin really does just does that ichikawa could do his breath murasaki
shikibu does me kimono kraus and tears and violette leduc and j g suicide
down by the river and ichikawa on the radio down by the river where nicole
does the slow sashes with zeami and celan half in half out of the water
drying off

there's also the aspect of gratitude towards authors, doing what they're
doing, we don't have to do the authors, as in 'have you done ryuichi
tamura yet,' there's a knowledge in the container, open container, in the
container's the wisdom we want, we don't have to open it

container's marked, floated down the river, j g ballard's there, body gone
by, celan can't swim either, it's these moments grateful for the water in
the jar, open it up, close it again, open it, close it, open it, close it, 
gratitude towards authors in the choice of the thing

or the making of it, what might be called an after thought, better again,
future anterior, held close to the abdomen, breathed in slowly, in and out
of the river, in the river, out of it, in the river, out of it, and grati-
tude toward authors in the choice of the world and the rectitude of names,
in the gift of the names, and forgetting the thing
