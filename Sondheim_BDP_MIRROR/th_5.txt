The Exactitude of Strings for Amir Vahab


http://www.alansondheim.org/aud06.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/Amir.mp3

Solo cura saz. The instrument was set up and altered by
Amir Vahab, a brilliant musician, teacher, and repairer.
The cura is the smallest saz, which makes it necessary
for the tied-on fretting to be incredibly exact (at to a
less than millimeter tolerance). Because of his work, I
can play the cura without worry, moving quickly around
the neck; everything's in tune, unless I'm not of course,
and everything is perfect. Enjoy!

no-hole shakuhachi!


http://www.alansondheim.org/nohole.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/nohole.mp3
http://www.alansondheim.org/nohole1.mp3


today, Perry Yung visited us, and brought us two e-flat no-hole 
shakuhachi. this is, as it says, a shakuhachi flute with proper 
mouthpiece and internal coating, but without fingerholes. it's a 
wonderful and amazing gift! I had spoken to him about one 
earlier; I wanted to see what I could do with a tube, how my 
breathing would be affected, whether I could play it at all. I 
also wanted to use it for breathing and thinking breathing.

the instruments were made from bamboo bought locally at Job Lot; 
the interiors aren't smoothed, but similar to jinashi 
shakuhachis. very simple instruments with four bindings. the two 
use different bamboos; one has a wider bore and warmer tone, and 
the other is heavier, with a narrower bore. they make beautiful 
music, I think; reverberation has been added, that's all. these 
pieces are probably as close to enlightenment as I'll ever get!

the nohole.mp3 is on the wider bore instrument, which surprised 
me; the other is on the narrow bore. for listening, the first is 
probably more successful, but for playing, they both raised me 
off the floor.

(Perry made one for me and one for Azure; perhaps we can play 
duets!)

with immense gratitude to Perry!

Promissory

http://www.alansondheim.org/promissory.jpg

It's not as if there isn't a picture to lure you in; I might 
have made one from a screenshot of this very text, it would have 
been duplicated, letter by letter, you might have seen it as an 
echo or other resonant form; instead I'm at a loss, what sort of 
lure might work, for example something so strong that it would 
make you want to give up your home, your friends, your country, 
and go, and live in the desert, and kill people; this could be a 
promissory note that you would go to heaven or live eternally in 
a god's paradise, this very statement might do it for you, in, 
in the form of an image, of text, no other images are allowed, 
would you leave, then, now, would you wait, until the morning, 
what would you take, with you, do you know the journey, the 
danger, the morning, the evening, prayer, the prayer at midday, 
the people who would help you, those who would be a danger to 
you, those who would not help you, those who would trust you and 
those who would not, the desert awaits you, it reaches out, to 
you, with its heat, its thirst, its scorched lands, its tombs, 
to be destroyed, to be forgotten, it reaches out to you from 
town to town, market to market, cave to cave, people, waiting 
for you, with open arms, fearful of you, of your power, of your 
blade, your transmission, your signal, hordes, this is the 
promissory, the permission slip, the license, to leave, to 
worship, attain, to kill, to be killed, to attenuate, to come 
forth, to relieve, by night, by day, to withdraw, to cut 
through, to cut out, cut across, to carry, to be carried, to 
come, to arrive, to have arrived, to go, to be gone, to be gone
