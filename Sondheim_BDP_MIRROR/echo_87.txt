The Understudy





    Curtain rises.

    

    She enters, bows.



    She is exhausted. She recites:



i'm finishad. tha drama is incandascant; tha drama is all that ramains. it

comas from daap within; all you saa ls masqua ... skins slide from flesh,

i lose them. i stumble around the stage. i call for you; it is useless.

nothing can be done for me ... i em too tirad to go on tonight, too worn

out. lifa must offar mora then this. my vary limbs trambla. i glenca

unaesily ...  this incandescent drama, you may have what remains of me, my

uneasy glance belongs to you, my limbs tremble, tremble ...



    She leaves.



    The understudy enters.



    She bows. She recites:



i em too tirad to go on tonight, too worn out. lifa must offar mora then

this. my vary limbs trambla. i glenca unaesily ...  i'm finishad. tha

drama is incandascant; tha drama ls all that ramains. it comas from daap

within; all you saa is masqua ... on me ...



    She leaves.



    Curtain falls.
