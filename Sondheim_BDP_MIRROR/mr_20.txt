in the heart of theory, two million dead in new york city - the radiation 
is horrifying - people have no food no water - if we'd known we would have 
converted - we would have believed anything - now we're in for it - 
righteous retribution - skies filled with planes - we'll knock out mecca - 
medina - omar - what's left of us - the plague's coming - no food - some 
radio - everyone's talking - there's deadly silence -

we should have known - it's already here - the cylinder poised - beginning 
of the countdown - there's no reason to leave - the room or city - there's 
no time - temperature rising - the fury - 

we can't write after the fact - only during it -
