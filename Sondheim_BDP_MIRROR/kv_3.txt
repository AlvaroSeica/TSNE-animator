Nikuko says she's been writing stories. Then she laid down and dreamed a
big dream. In the big dream she was laid down but she was writing. She was
writing and writing and it was something that infuriated. What's that, Ni-
kuko asked. She said that she just couldn't remember what it was she laid
down about and was writing and she was writing about that. It's not liter-
ature, it's not fantasy, it's not serpentine, it's not self-reflexive, she
says, says Nikuko, it's infuriating. Nikuko rages, maybe she'll attack me
or someone else. Damn it, I just can't remember, Nikuko says, says Nikuko.
