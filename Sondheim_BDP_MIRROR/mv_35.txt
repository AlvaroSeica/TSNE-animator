Al-Ghazali, commentary on Internet Text:

a book of scribbles, nonsense, a book which shifts out from under you -
a contrary or wayward book, self-contrary, asking nothing -
a book to be read in any position, in any state of mind - 
a book of meaningless revelations -
a book to be pronounced or mispronounced any way you like -
a book to be read once or thousands of times, or not to be read at all -
a book of any emotional states of writers and readers -
a book to be handled with purity or impurity, scarcity or excess -
a book read in murmuring, silence, politely, a book to be read out loud -
a book to be read quickly, almost in a blur or slowly at a standstill -
a book without supplication, an orderly or disorderly book -
a book without obeisance or honor, a dishonorable book -
a book any way one wants it, an irritable confusing book -
a book you can put down at any time or read through all at once -
a book whose length grows, a mumbled indistinct book -
a book of many colors and images, a perverse and impolitic book -
a vowelless and unreadable book -
an illegible book, without punctuation -
an archaic book from the future, an anachronistic book from the past -
a book of run-on sentences, words, and chapters, dissembling, unclear -
a book of diminished speech, of intensities and dissolutions -
a wavering and belittled book, a wavered and belittling book -
a book neither here nor there, neither this nor that -
a book to be dismissed, a book displaced by wandering souls -
a misinterpreted book, a book without interpretation -
a book without conceivable interpretation, a mute and blurred book -
an opaque book, a book with obstacles, a book of obstacles -
a book of generalities, an insipid and tepid book -
an unfeeling and austere book, a book without emotional response -
a book of babbling and indecipherable voices -
an unsatisfying and incomplete book, a book impossible to grasp -
