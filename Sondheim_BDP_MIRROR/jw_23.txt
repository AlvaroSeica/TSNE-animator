		  when i am stable i am like a table
		 with four legs down and no questions
		and when i am down like now, the maple
		outside the window rings its bastions
       o-----     with brancherly concerns, and when     -----o
		like now i think of suicide and hills
	 because sadness stems from treacherous fern and fen
	    then i hunt for something stronger than pills
	      to kill memories and mocking-birds singing
	      each to each something different like snow
	    flakes covering this corpse high and winging-o
	       flaking your cunt from me as if a throw
	   winged it higher until the throat's loud course
	      crossed the trajectory of horse and hearse
	   where nothing treds across the hedge and gorse,
	    no lines of song and dead you fuck me, cursed
	    v           v                  v            v
