(says no one) from beneath the ground and its cavern:

Chuang Tzu, old Giles translation: You would have sympathized, but you
could not understand. You would have looked, but you could not see. You
would have pursued but you could not overtake. You stood dazed in the
middle of the wilderness, leaning against a tree and crooning, your eye
conscious of exhausted vision, your strength failing for the pursuit, and
so unable to overtake me. Your frame was but an empty shell. You were
completely at a loss, and so you were amazed.

(says no one) from beneath the ground and its cavern: You would have iden-
tified with the grid, but you could not understand. You would have looked,
but you would not have empathized. You would have empathized and then
would tell and name. You stood dazed in the middle of the cavern, leaning
against an image and murmuring the very first words ever, your eye uncon-
scious of depleted vision coming around to the fullest, your strength
gaining as you would overtake. Delay-decay. Your frame was coming into fo-
cus, you were moving from inside to outside, internal to external, intrin-
sic to extrinsic, intensive to extensive, intent to extent. You were no
longer amazed (says no one), coming into fulfillment, not aware that such
was the case of the real, that it was no case at all.
