==


living within our means
of the abacus as if we're haunted by beadwork
and its mobility, as if ends were always elsewhere
beyond the framework
really nothing more than a domain or groundwork
where you might find someone sweeping the garden
of stones into patterns always forgetting
every one of them moving, about to be moved,
about to move, every one of them quiet, in place
beyond the framework,
invisible, as we're
borne in streams, as we're borne streams, muting
along worn and barely visible furrows, in earth
or stone, or in water or among membranes, most
comforting, surrounding us, placenta feeding us,
or feeding gardens, or earthwork,
or groundwork, with furrows, as we begin,
to constitute, or begin, to cancel and as we begin,
to calculate or begin,
the smallest particle of speech, already bead,
already speechwork, already labor, and
the measurement of the hole, where nearly, the bead
might move, in placework, might be placed,
might place, among our conscious, within, withal,
our perplexity, that we may comprehend, mindwork,
furrows and garden, work and beadwork, softly
already
