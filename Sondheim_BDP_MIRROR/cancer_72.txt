Department of Language


Put to death anyone working in the Department of Language.
Our motto is death to anyone working in language.
This order which shall not be countermanded applies on every level.
Those in charge of referents deserve our special attention.
Language shall not be tethered with any relation to the real.
Let death be quick for those concerned with antiquity and adjectives.
Let those compiling concordances die the slowest death of all.
Our motto is let the work come swiftly to an end.
Not language but workers shall become a memory written in language.
This order is against the possibility of survival.
Not libraries but librarians shall be slaughtered as well.
Libraries are not tethered to the Department of Language.
The trouble with libraries is the records of every department.
Let the records be freed and released and leave the libraries alone.
Our motto is release the records and release the librarians.
Our motto is only the Department of Language but never the libraries.
This order shall not be countermanded.
