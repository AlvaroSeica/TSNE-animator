Wheeling


I like this one. Julu's wheel is mysterious and seems to run everything 
around it.
That is the fate of wheels.

Wheels, empathy, you drive and the landscape ... wheels, turning the world
left and right, you're steering among them.

Directions, what you steer among.

You never go where you're aiming, you circle about it, about the vector.
(Bicycles.)

Now it's late in the afternoon, almost evening, light beginning to 
tremble, everything running smoothly, a beautiful feeling.
The most beautiful feeling in the world, turning around you.

the difficulty of hi-speed physics: sending objects back
to the database in Second Life

http://www.alansondheim.org/curled.mp4

here's what happens:

It's a small screen because compression found it difficult. large-scale 
objects are positioned and dropped, fly off. some remain grounded for a 
while; these "lucky ones" are given a chance to live - the physical 
attribute is unchecked, and they remain placed, awkwardly, adding to the 
jumble. Gravity plays its role, but only so far. the site appears less and 
less designed, more and more as if an alien force has taken over - and it 
has, one might be considered a simulacrum of the real, designated by 
weight. So weight connects the real to the virtual, but only so far; 
weight's abstracted, unlike the avatars themselves, which are only empty 
images. Weight isn't an empty image, weight's not an image at all, 
weight's only what's made of it, and what it makes of an object. Of course 
an object has to be elevated; situated snugly on the ground, nothing at 
all happens; it might as well be virtual ...

the bad patch


couldn't get the stutter in the script, i.e. 
{rotate m degrees}{stop for n seconds}{repeat}
too stupid to program this, too ignorant.
things falling off world in all directions.
have to put them back, what's their name.
too stupid to change names, too lazy.
names a bad patch, i do not know them.
i do not know their names, slowed them.
slowed some of the wheels, gift for me.
gift for me, i can catch them.
i can catch them make them something new.
too lazy to make them new, what else is new.
what else is new, i go through a bad patch.
julu twine the bad patch. alan sondheim the bad patch.
nikuko the bad patch. alan dojoji the bad patch.
second life the bad patch, first life the bad patch.
lifeless the bad patch, unlife the bad patch.
tho i hate them i do not want to die.
death the bad patch, patch the bad patch.
patch patch patch the bad patch. 
patch patch patch.

Plateau Reached


http://www.alansondheim.org/ aaa series - video kanji stills on complex 
hypertropied objects (very beautiful)
http://www.alansondheim.org/both.mp4 - reworking the hermaphrodite
(short, dark)
http://www.alansondheim.org/kanjj3.mov - aaa series in video (fairly 
interesting)
http://www.alansondheim.org/ aabod series - 1-7 images used in body 
mapping; a-f beginnings of hypertrophia (some quite nice)

my end of a conversation with  Miulew Takahe  in Second Life:

[14:48]  Alan Dojoji: If you're in the outer section turn the video
on -
[14:49]  Alan Dojoji: I've been tuning it.
[14:49]  Alan Dojoji: That's a LONG time in SL
[14:49]  Alan Dojoji: I've been changing the space almost daily
[14:50]  Alan Dojoji: I've been here a lot - I don't know how long
I'll have to use the space (Sugar's been out of touch)
[14:50]  Alan Dojoji: and there's a lot I want to do
[14:51]  Alan Dojoji: I hope so - I have performances coming up and
want to carefully deconstruct the space, not take it down quickly
[14:56]  Alan Dojoji: Fairly often. It's gotten more confusing/denser
as time goes on
[14:56]  Alan Dojoji: I keep adding the physical attribute to some of
the objects to watch/record them going off-world
[14:57]  Alan Dojoji: And I'm trying to make the space a kind of
liquid architecture/malleable space/deconstruction, whatever, doing a
lot of writing about it
[14:57]  Alan Dojoji: :-) it's hard to create density in such a small
area - so I don't intrude on other works in Odyssey -
[14:57]  Alan Dojoji: It's like Manhattan
[14:57]  Alan Dojoji: it goes up and down, not sideways
[14:58]  Alan Dojoji: Manhattan is HUGE underground with subways
pipes water conduits archaeological remnants, fairly amazing
[14:58]  Alan Dojoji: But it doesn't move like this and it weighs
more.
[14:59]  Alan Dojoji: That's part of the idea, a kind of negotiation
[14:59]  Alan Dojoji: My avatar is almost impossible to move at this
point - I can't see around it -
[14:59]  Alan Dojoji: but it writes in the sky
[15:00]  Alan Dojoji: No, I think text would ruin it - it's more a
landscape without signage, some sort of wilderness
[15:01]  Alan Dojoji: it connects directly with the writings which
are kind of a naturalist's take on the thing. like looking at
fossils.
[15:04]  Alan Dojoji: I collected them when I was youmnger - a kind
of reading you have to do in an archaic landscape
[15:05]  Alan Dojoji: constantly with video and images, but it's hard
to get the details.
[15:05]  Alan Dojoji: I'm running video now -
[15:05]  Alan Dojoji: I'd like to get a decent record but it's
difficult
[15:06]  Alan Dojoji: On the other hand we're making a cd, some of
this music will be on it.
[15:07]  Alan Dojoji: Yes if you run the music in the space - there
are different songs in different regions
[15:08]  Alan Dojoji: I think the sounds adds but I've heard it too
often - I don't change it as much as the rest of it
[15:11]  Alan Dojoji: Wow - it kept your avatar that long! I'm going
to log off myself at the moment; I want to edit the video
[15:11]  Alan Dojoji: Nice seeing you as well! Perhaps in Sweden -
[15:11]  Alan Dojoji: Do look down below the exhibition space and in
the skysphere above if you have tihe time - they're different
[15:11]  Alan Dojoji: Thanks - talk with you soon -
[15:11]  Alan Dojoji: bye now
[15:12]  Alan Dojoji is Offline


Dance and Gravity


For gravity is everywhere, loving us bone by bone, cell by cell, atom by 
atom; think of gravity as strings everywhere in a dream, caressing and 
tugging the world into shape. [...]

I envy Foofwa who travels with his body, observing the movement of the 
scenery, the great wheel of the world, within the atmospheric, untoward 
stars and constellations. Teleporting not only collapses distance; it 
implicates space itself in fraud, the clearest evidence of database. I 
long for the seamlessness of the real world, its inconceivable vulner- 
ability, its joy and suffering in our darkest hours, its fantasms and 
hallucinatory quality. In Second Life, one never wakes from the dream, 
dream is all there is; in dance, gravity surrounds and infiltrates the 
body - Foofwa travels to Lebanon on a plane whose wings suck it up into 
the sky, where comfort, great circles, and vectors reign. It takes time 
and shadows of dawn and dusk, morning and evening, to achieve anything. 
It takes rehearsal time, stretching and turning and other movements and 
parallelograms of force, the soft speaking of gravity, the hardness of 
silence, among dance and a communality of dancers, audience, presenters, 
choreographers, as if the world momentarily separated into categories. 

In Second Life there is nothing to see; it is all visible, all present, 
even give members-only barriers. It is flat, simulacrum and hyperreality 
all in one; it goes nowhere. Something drops from the sky, founders, but 
nothing breaks, there is no wear-and-tear. Even the text-based MUDs in a 
sense were more realistic; one's avatar had to eat and drink, wore out, 
perchance to sleep, but the MUDs were game-based and one can't fight 
forever. Dance is brilliant burning; bodies wear out, and even today 
documentation of choreographies is insufficient: What goes, what leaves 
the earth in exhaustion or death has placed memory at the heart of the 
world, and memory is the most vulnerable of all. Still, memory seeps into 
the mind, into the very bones, of the spectator, who moves and thinks 
differently, however slight; her body's muscles carry the evening, even 
from the silence of a chair. It is a ritual of inhering; the scopic act, 
I think, is always already ikonic, always at work with the dancer, in a 
way one only dreams about in Second Life. Second Life's simulacrum is 
binary, either on or off; the screen is illuminated or dark, sound and 
video present or absent, and so forth; these doors don't wear out, but are 
replaced by newer versions of the software brought down to hard drive by 
the mother company.

Second Life seeps into the first; being in Second Life, as anyone will 
tell you, is being in the first, and Second Life's dreams are tableaus in 
first life's night. But still there's a difference which goes back to the 
negation of the planet, negation in the world as one turns away from 
another, as a species dies or a forest is logged or a community is 
slaughtered. I think this is at the heart of the real and oddly at the 
heart of Second Life itself, which is pushed into modes of surrealism and 
the fantastic, as if it were possible to keep dis/ease at bay. I am sure, 
though, that Second Life, like MUDs or MOOs or other populations, will 
have its death off-screen, silencing every and all, returning these to 
memory as well. (I remember the 'QRB' - quota review board - on PMC-MOO: 
who even knows what I'm talking about?) By the time and space of that 
death, only a virtual world will disappear, one whose weight is zero, and 
whose gravity may be turned on and off at will. Or at the will of another 
in physics calculated, not from the very inhering or substance of matter, 
but in the matter of a suitable abstraction intentionally built-in. 
Falling is no danger; and Foofwa, on his way to Lebanon for choreography, 
dance, presentation, warmup, rehearsal, blocking, teaching, learning, is 
up there above a game-space from which there is no escape, the 'idiotic' 
and inert real of a world of given without a giver - a world whose 
resource use is already above its carrying-capacity, and therefore a world 
of zaniness and suffering. This is a world always at war with itself with 
greater and greater fire-power, while we avatars fall and fall from the 
sky, always landing in interesting ways, undamaged and somnolent while we 
take a break for dinner.

Distance effects


Proximity switches moving objects and particle emitters out of avatars' 
ways. A switch may move an object 25i down or 125i up, as well as 50i down 
(i = unit). An object appears not to be able to move down indefinitely, 
but stop somewhat beneath the surface of the seabed. An object appears to 
move up indefinitely. If a 125i up object is approached, it moves 125i up; 
if it is then approached, it moves another 125i, i.e. 250i. The fear is 
that objects will leave the site permanently - that they will continue to 
move vertically, abandoning the jumble affect. However, objects also seem 
to return slowly to their original positions or close to their original 
positions. 

One of the large circular objects becomes a fence in the exhibition space 
as it sinks beneath the floor. Going down into the seabed area becomes 
more and more confused, as any number of objects are down there, moving 
and rotating, waiting for the avatar or avatars to move out of the zone of 
influence.

http://www.alansondheim.org/ galaxy jpgs

Objects and avatars in other words are in constant dialog; the world is 
mutually motivated; in the long reach, intentionality is filled with 
misrecognition; the database is inviolate (even with hacking, prim 
proliferation, the database is inviolate).

What idiots!




Images and Commentary


(This might be the clearest exposition I've been able make re: the Second 
Life installation. The commentary is just that, a kind of epistemological 
description. The world of the show, the true world or virtual or dream or 
real world, comes through, I think. And from this perhaps to the show 
itself, where everything moves, and contemplation is more difficult, close 
to impossible at times, and hopefully rewarding.)

http://www.alansondheim.org/mur01.jpg

Julu write in the sky of Second Life; in the skysphere, the writing, the 
digital itself, is endlessly duplicated. The simulacrum of distance leads 
to the vanishing point of writing, literally unadulterated space. This 
could be any future in which dimensionality leads to dimensional collapse.

http://www.alansondheim.org/mur02.jpg

A similar image; it's clear, through a consideration of the difference 
between the two, that the opticality is the result of an intersection of a 
disk with a sphere; unlike the sphere, the center of the disk is striated.

http://www.alansondheim.org/mur03.jpg

Julu as hermaphroditic writer hirself, endlessly duplicated; the wryting 
(of the body) swings out as wrything.

http://www.alansondheim.org/mur04.jpg

The writing gathers thickly into tiled kanji; each stroke extends in width 
as well as length. A second illusion: that of pipes among Julu and hir 
processes. This first set of images is variants among a basic configura- 
tion.

http://www.alansondheim.org/mur05.jpg

The sphere/disk contraption is populated by Julu, torso, cone, an image of 
myself as fundamental structure (on one hand) but vulnerable to swarm (on 
the other). Of course the cone falls through the bottom of the image, 
lands nowhere, just something teetering as if it provided an axis (it does 
not).

http://www.alansondheim.org/mur06.jpg

Color differentiates sphere from disk, and sphere becomes oddly heraldic - 
a shield or boiler interior, documentation of the metaphoric.

http://www.alansondheim.org/mur07.jpg

A second view; oddly in this one, it's possible to see the broken remnant 
of another disk to the right of the first; it too circulates, almost 
entirely outside of the sphere. By now this series is exhausting itself 
and it is getting close to the time when one moves on to the promise or 
premise of new directions.

One disk seen through another. The texture map between two images of 
Yamantaka is based on skin around the vocal cords; one sees through speech 
to hungry ghosts, murmurs almost gathered into words, the inchoate lost in 
itself. I'd call this image beautiful, but that worries.

http://www.alansondheim.org/mur09.jpg

Exterior shot of sphere (foreground), major intersecting disk with parti- 
cle emission from the center (the phonemic) and other ascendent disks, 
implying that the series, like Brancusi's column, might continue forever. 
In this case, in the absent of gravity, mountainous height is easily in 
reach - without, however, any indication of the sublime. The sublime is no 
longer that which disappears, but its ghost is at the end of teleportation 
- everything portends an inconceivable clarity miles up in a sky which is 
just as airless below sea level as it is anywhere else. The disks revolve 
at varying speeds, and appear to revolve forever; the energy driving them 
comes from the reading/writing of servers and local machines, one might 
say by a circuitous route.

http://www.alansondheim.org/mur10.jpg

Looking down the same chain from above; the disks radiate two types of 
particles, two physics only partially responding to the simulacrum of 
weather. The disks are deliberately off-kilter; everything in the instal- 
lation wobbles, as if about to break loose - in spite of being totally 
determined by a relatively obdurate database.

http://www.alansondheim.org/mur11.jpg

Archaeology of older objects held in stationary positions in the sky. 
These objects do not move; they exist as extensions of the land coordin- 
ates, although close to a fictitious kilometer up. The shapes are 
'troubled,' as if from half-dreams or hypnagogic images. Everything around 
them moves, but they are a form of written history. The history extends 
back no more than five months, but it is present in quick-time fast-for- 
ward process. Think of it! Moving around, among, inscription, as if 
inscription were part and parcel of the world and (avatar, human) body 
itself (it is).

http://www.alansondheim.org/mur12.jpg

Another view of the previous using the light palette of the Hudson River 
School or Illuminists. The object are situated against embers; wheels are 
visible, as are landscape elements by other artists in the distance.

http://www.alansondheim.org/mur13.jpg

Collusion of spaces and times: Static objects, disks, mutoscopes, emis- 
sions,, all under the watch of Julu Twine, who had a role in their 
creation. The communality of objects is evident; everything is in groups, 
regular or irregular, symmetrical or apparently scattered - Wolfram's 
cellular automata, via Rudy Rucker, come to mind.

http://www.alansondheim.org/mur14.jpg

Beneath the gallery installation, a view within the water, looking towards 
the sea-bed. The image is complex and moving at furious speed; many of 
these objects have hurtled from the surface in relation to the presence of 
an avatar (proximity switching) - others remains as denizens of the ocean. 
Things appear as part-objects as they rise above the floor of the gallery 
or sink into the ocean surface. This is possibly the most successful of 
the scapes, carrying the weight of the true world, dream and real and 
virtual, inscriptive and inert, within it.

http://www.alansondheim.org/mur15.jpg

We are back in the sky (perhaps there have been inadvertent teleports); 
the archaeology is now visible from below.

http://www.alansondheim.org/mur16.jpg

And from the side. This mapping reveals tiling strategies; as in the sky- 
sphere, I'm photographically present on a rectangular object (which is out 
of place; it's one of the architectural building-blocks of the now decon- 
structed museum), a problematic punctum mirroring the skysphere cone.

http://www.alansondheim.org/mur17.jpg

An odd image in the process of configuration/construction: the heart of 
Nikuko (Alan Dojoji), a female figure without the attachments that will 
dwarf her and appear less than a second later. She has just landed as the 
database approximately reconstructs her previous position - hence her 
awkward stance. Unlike Julu Twine, she is responsible and in charge of the 
exhibition; she can place objects where she wants, alter the video and 
sounds, and do other basic tasks (including banning avatars) which are 
impossible for the other. She's necessary for building, but with the 
attachments, it's almost impossible to see around her. So she drops 
objects and begins them; they're finished by Julu Twine, who comes in lean 
as caretaker, designer, and artist. This image almost never appears by the 
way, so fast are the clothes (object attachments, in this case large 
partially-visible objects and particle generators) placed on the armature; 
it was a database error that allowed me to snap the image.

http://www.alansondheim.org/mur18.jpg

Mapped sky disks in irregular positions. These are the lower disks just 
above the exhibition space. The pink texture is that of an avatar body; 
without modification it might form the basis for Julu's hermaphroditic 
morphing. Note the skin textures between the kalaidoscopic sky writing 
images; these are from vocal cords and (male) groin.

http://www.alansondheim.org/mur19.jpg

Stacked and wobbled upper disks with mapped sky writing. This indicates 
the general architectural strategy of disk alignment - almost, but not 
quite, synchronous wheels or gears. Sometimes the disk fall or disappear, 
as if part of a natural world (I have no accounting for this).

http://www.alansondheim.org/mur20.jpg

Another view of the same; in this one Julu Twine appears as inscriber and 
the particle emissions from the disk centers are clear. These emissions 
use the same configuration as the particle writers of both Julu Twine and 
Nikuko; they stand in for smokers on the deeper beds of the ocean near 
tectonic rifts. Out in the light of dusk, they do nothing but revolve, 
inert, useless, magnificent, sublime perhaps but only from the periphery, 
a kind of neural distance as fantastic as anything else here.

http://www.alansondheim.org/mur21.jpg

Yet another view, with the skysphere, still carrying its yellow tinting 
below (this was later changed to neutral grey). The horizon itself has air 
above featureless cloud.

http://www.alansondheim.org/mur22.jpg

Nighttime illumination of disks; in the distance, Nikuko (Alan Dojoji) can 
be seen. She controls the disk images and permissions, as mentioned above. 
Particles and her full regalia are visible.

http://www.alansondheim.org/mur23.jpg

Looking up from the installation space. Architectural flats are visible on 
the periphery. Another video is visible in the center of a horizontal 
disk. It's close to noon. The edges of fast-moving transparent objects are 
visible.

http://www.alansondheim.org/mur24.jpg

In this image, there are four or five intersecting disks, all linked, all 
slated to disappear (without a trace, i.e. they're not 'returned from off 
world') shortly. The disks carry very complex video texturing; the result 
is the kind of jumble that fascinates me, a tangled somewhat spherical 
landscape (but not quite spherical, not quite landscape) that doesn't 
resolve. Another texture of Yamantaka, one that doesn't map video, is 
visible on part of one of the disks. The scene is dusk again.

http://www.alansondheim.org/mur25.jpg

A similar shot as the previous; in this one, the spherical shape is broken 
and distorted, and an architectural flat can be seen moving at high speed 
in the upper portion of the image.

http://www.alansondheim.org/mur26.jpg

A general dusk view with complex video texturing near the entrance to the 
installation. This gets close to the appearance of jumble (fourth stage in 
Wolfram's categories, the gnarly, through Rucker); this is an almost 
impossible space to negotiate. Note that the disks themselves intersect 
and distort one another. In this view, objects coalesce, disappear, frag- 
ment, erupt, and so forth; it's impossible to unite them - it's also 
impossible to separate them. Clarity disappears in favor of the amphi- 
bolic.

http://www.alansondheim.org/mur27.jpg

A general view of the teetering wheels in the installation; many of these 
will disappear within twenty minutes or so. Most of the wheels have 
corrupted surfaces; Julu avoids the purely symmetric and its effect. Real 
crystals are rarely perfect and are paralleled here by occlusions and 
distortions of all sorts.

http://www.alansondheim.org/mur28.jpg

This is an earlier view of the entrance before more complex elements were 
added and/or transformed. Note the roughly spherical objects; these are 
forced skyward by avatar presence. As mentioned in another text, they may 
be forced indefinitely upward, but seem to eventually return to their 
original position, almost resting on the ground (as if they were resting 
on the ground).

http://www.alansondheim.org/mur29.jpg

The final image in the series, taken from beyond and slightly below the 
sea wall bordering the Odyssey land tract and exhibition space. The cone 
on the left, texture-mapped with an image of a penis, teleports to the 
sky-sphere and moves, piston-like (and bad metaphorically) in and out of a 
well. The black skein-object to the right aligns with the ring- and moss- 
objects, all of which are partly invisible, membranes or skeins somewhat 
demarcating territory. Think of everything here moving at very high speed, 
Julu buffeted about by objects beneath her as well as those visible in the 
image. It should be noted that a few objects shuttle slowly back and forth 
and others slowly revolve, as if in court dances; these aren't grounds but 
mutual interferences with the fast-forward ones. Cones and disks wobble, 
Yamantaka carrying prayer-wheels carrying Yamantaka, hungry ghosts resid- 
ing just beyond the screen. All screens are dream-screens and all dreams 
are screens. Julu Twine looks on; the position of her arms indicates she 
is trying to remain upright, focused, on nothing and everything at all.


(I hope this elucidation indicates that the images from the installation 
aren't random, that the installation coheres within and without the 
pseudo-random, that reason and reasoning are problematic in the face or 
alterity of negotiation (which does not necessarily imply a strategy 
within the symbolic), and that there is meaning in the madness, madness in 
the meaning, and that the world is gnarly, distorted, always already 
incomplete, and somewhat beautiful and deadly.)

Dubb, Waiting, Landing


From an older video of Maud Liardon, towards Nikuko (who has exchanged 
bodies with Julu Twine):

http://www.alansondheim.org/dubb.mp4

Modified section of solo dance choreographed by Foofwa d'Imobilite.

Perhaps related to The Landing at http://www.alansondheim.org/landing.jpg

Let's think about the landing, what makes a landscape photograph 
interesting, what constitutes beauty, why does this particular one hold 
the viewer, perhaps the moon over the ocean on the left, slightly 
distorted by the wide-angle lens, perhaps the lozenge-shaped island on 
the right, delicately poised in the moonlight, perhaps the jeweled disks 
or diadems hovering in the air and silent, perhaps the luminous quality of 
the human-made objects in this human-made landscape - and perhaps these 
qualities hold the image in memory, as if emerging inchoate from the 
imaginary, dream and real and virtual and true, and then a kind of 
gathering towards a strange attractor, not quite symbol but shimmering 
within the ikonic, the punctum-vortex which dissipates as it forms (the 
land is so somnolent); and let's think about the moment of solo dance, 
doubled upon itself, the slightest movement of the real and the avatar, 
perhaps mycenean and certainly classical, echo increasing as time passes, 
the body moving away from itself, slightly stuttering, waiting for 
something to happen, and then, towards the end, but not really ending, 
framing the chiasm, as if symbolic, the movement caught in the soft 
somnolent air, memory of a landscape, odysseus.



The Sundry What-if


Experiments go awry or wayward, changes damage or destroy objects, some 
things go off world, some vanish. Here are results/documents of today's 
session, a kind of reporting or phenomenology of the what-if:

http://www.alansondheim.org/excrescence01.jpg

An almost invisible Julu Twine rides the red disk just about to disappear. 
The disk has a script; proximity raises it about 50m. The disk began on 
the installation floor, rose to this height when Julu Twine sat on it: 
What if Julu Twine sits? It didn't rise indefinitely but it finally left 
Second Life, permanently; nothing returned to the Lost and Found in 
Inventory.

http://www.alansondheim.org/excrescence02.jpg

Red disk from below, Julu riding on the other side. Everything revolves, 
but the disk alone is unstable. Eventually Julu will rise and the disk 
suddenly flies off, magic disappearance trick. Later I'd return to the 
installation to see if it reappeared in its usual position or somewhere 
somewhat above it - no such luck. At least not yet.

http://www.alansondheim.org/excrescence03.jpg

View of Julu riding the disk, closeup; wobbled diadem wheels revolve at 
right angles behind her. The entire scene shakes on the screen, Julu's 
movement affecting the camera.

http://www.alansondheim.org/excrescence04.jpg

Something entirely different: Julu wears several wobbling diadem wheels 
simultaneously. S/he's lost in the midst of them; they're generating male 
organs; images of females and males, distorted, abound, are tiled, the 
whole forming an incandescent Tiepolo. Once I discovered the viewpoint, I 
continued to experiment - from sliver of open sky to architecture and 
ceiling.

http://www.alansondheim.org/excrescence05.jpg

The smaller figures fill, fulfill the space, sperm within the matrix; you 
must imagine all of this wildly circulating - you must also imagine a 
certain blindness: It's impossible to see beyond or behind hir in any 
viewpoint - s/he's flying blind. The body extensions, which are the body 
itself, are enormous; Julu remains at the center of hir universe which is 
the universe, there is no other within and without these whirlings of 
worlds of fecundity, abjection, birth and death.

http://www.alansondheim.org/excrescence06.jpg

But Julu was inconceivable; I moved hir away from things, into the night- 
time sky, then withdrew from hir and at a safe distance turned around and 
took this image - enormous cosmic Julu, an inflationary universe within an 
invisible embedding space, the usual topography of Second Life.

http://www.alansondheim.org/excrescence07.jpg

Another closer view; the interlocking diadems are clearly visible but hir 
body proper is not. Technically I had to experiment with glows, interior 
lights, to get this image - it was easy to saturate, overpower everything 
with untoward illumination.

http://www.alansondheim.org/excrescence08.jpg

Julu with diadems detached enters the skysphere; here hir body contorts by 
virtue of revolving diadems and the sphere itself. S/he's lost in deity, 
Yamantaka, in the midst of hir own corporeality. S/he came here immedi- 
ately after the diadem experiment - now s/he's working with something 
else.

http://www.alansondheim.org/excrescence09.jpg

A general view of the current installation with Julu Twine and attached 
diadems. This tableau is complex; a cone, which rises and falls to the 
ground near the seawall in front of the installation, is linked to a 
number of objects - all of them revolve together, around the fulcrum of 
the cone. This extends diadems and other sculptured elements into and 
above the sea itself - even though the elements are individually now off- 
world, they're linked together in a way that grounds them. The revolving 
is abject and confused; it intersects with all of the other whirled 
elements in the installation, as well as with Julu Twine's elements. One 
can't tell - Julu can't tell - where body and diadems begin or end. There 
are different epistemologies of the virtual here, different extensions of 
body and topography, which together appear inconsistent and contrary.

http://www.alansondheim.org/excrescence10.jpg

Another view of the same setup as the previous image - the diadem on the 
left is sweeping through Julu, the ocean, and the landscape in general; 
unlike detached and independent diadems, this one seems ghostlike, as does 
Julu's - they intersect without any sort of mutual interaction.

http://www.alansondheim.org/excrescence11.jpg

Another view of Julu within the wheeled diadems which extend hir body. In 
this image, s/he is animated by a bvh file from the altered motion capture 
equipment - the body distortion distortions the diadems around hir, 
although it's difficult to tell from within.

http://www.alansondheim.org/excrescence12.jpg

Another interior view showing the complexity of the interlocked diadems. 
The textures, tiled images, form a sememe or partially-closed system 
completing and generating meaning. Dynamically, the images are for the 
most part unreadable; they move at enormous speed. The photograph becomes 
a kind of evidence, an analytical tool which doesn't get at essence but 
creates it.

http://www.alansondheim.org/excrescence13.jpg

Julu Twine's hermaphroditic body intersected by intersecting detached 
diadems in the skysphere.

http://www.alansondheim.org/excrescence14.jpg

Same as the previous, emphasizing the hands again in an untoward position 
due to hir movement from the bvh file. Skulls and eyes from the original 
tanka are watching.

http://www.alansondheim.org/excrescence15.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/excrescence16.jpg

These two images are taken at a relatively enormous distance from Julu; 
they're odd, reflecting odd behavior within Second Life - almost all 
the elements visible are original architectural elements within the 
installation building - what's left of the elements, those that remain in 
their proper setting. The only other things visible are the teleport 
spheres in the gallery - these spheres were generated with Second Life, 
i.e. not uploaded, and in a sense are native to the space. It's clear that 
something is occurring, but it's not clear what. It's only clear that a 
question is raised and somewhat, not entirely, answered -  What if - what 
if only the original elements remained in the space?

What if diadems were attached?
What if varied textures seem symbolic within a narrative sememe?
What if one object extends another safely out of world?
What if an object that moves away from avatars is ridden by one?
What if diadems collide as if grasping an avatar body?
What if diadems are attached to objects attached to an avatar body?
(Everything shortly disappears, except for the immediate attachment.)
What if?
What if?
What if?


(written under zero sleep, apologies, but there's 'something here')

The What-If


http://www.alansondheim.org/ layout jpgs

The last theoretical, what to do when exhausted to 
the point of trembling or shuddering, unchecked for 
reason, false grammar, confusion:

Vaihinger and Bentham both developed the concept of fictions or the as-if 
in relation to the real: as if the perceived real were real, as if reifi- 
cation were the state of things - as if the real were within the simile 
and subjunctive.

The what-if simultaneously doubles and reduces the as-if: Doubles, since 
it proposes an alternative branching or possible world which is an as-if 
within the as-if of th real - and reduces, since a fictionalized as-if 
(that is, the as-if as fiction) branched into the aegis of a dominant 
fiction no longer subjunctive - the what-if as production or temporal 
process creates a fiction without split - no longer 'as-if X were real 
within a perceived world that is necessarily split,' but an X which is all 
the real there is within a generated world or simulacrum.

The what-if simultaneously quadruples and collapses: Quadruples, since the 
epistemology splits and what is real has also divided - and collapses, 
since the fiction is ontologically degree-zero; one might also approach 
this in terms of codes and replaced or augmented codes, or replaced or 
augmented scripts or objects, therefore basic operations of annihilation, 
creation, displacement, condensation, substitution, branching and 
collapse.

The what-if does nothing and everything: Nothing, since ontology remains 
as before, and the model - for that is what we are introducing - utilizes 
the same fundamental rues, protocols, codes, and principles - and every- 
thing, since what occurs is the construct of a new universe, related to 
the old, but with a modification, however small.

The what-if places the world within which an enunciation is made, within 
the subjunctive; it is always a time-dependent process.

Any real or virtual movement within real or virtual worlds is a time- 
dependent process. But what-if is a movement with a diacritical mark or 
curlicue. 

The mark need not be within the real or virtual world; it may be within 
the world of the spectator. 

From the outside, a change is created within the gamespace. The rules 
within the gamespace are the same as before.

A change is made from without to within. A demarcation occurs, a 
separation of the gamespace into before and after.

Gamespace is always already before and after; the separation occurs on a 
meta-level.

The separation is semiotic and the construction of a semiotic.

The separation is a figure of speech.

There is speaking within and speaking without; a model might insist on 
these distinctions: go from real through virtual through channel through 
virtual through real.

Of course what is real is virtual and what is virtual is real. Of course 
the channel is simultaneously real and virtual; one might argue that the 
channel is the diacritical mark, the demarcation itself.

The demarcation may be fuzzy. The change from X to X' may be sufficiently 
complex as to prohibit or occlude a transformation. A transformation may 
occur - the result of a what-if process - without being noticed; there may 
be no notification or a misplaced or misrecognized notification.

So what-if implies an impending modification within a sememe from without; 
it splits from itself, constructs on a meta-level, a semiotic which breaks
through and within the discursive. The transformation within the real 
virtual, from X to X' is always already sutured; the break, again, occurs 
within the subject hirself outside of, or constructing an outside-of, the 
gamespace. 

Needless to say the what-if may be nothing more than conversational, i.e. 
what if the sky were green? It may or may not result in a process applied 
from without to an ostensible subject. The ostensible subject, gamespace, 
world, etc. may appear, from without, broken or of interest or anomalous 
or cohering or 'the same as before' within the epistemological limits of 
whatever transformations are already going on. The ostensible subject is 
the subject of the subject applying the what-if, that is, the external 
subject, placed as well, reflexively perhaps, within the subjunctive. 
Whether or not anything is 'really' carried out.

The what-if, then; is always already a thought-experiment as well, no 
matter what happens later or what happens reflexively, or even within the 
case where nothing happens at all.

One might say that the human project implies thrownness into and through- 
out the what-if on a continuous basis, that everything and nothing is 
happening, that this happening is a model for human existence and 
behavior.

And in this light, a model perhaps of every organic existence and behavior 
- but one might well ask if all organisms are capable of the subjunctive 
in the sense used here? I would say no, that the subjunctive implies 
something which, if not uniquely human, at least implies an intelligence 
organized according to a just-so, which is rarely found otherwise in the 
world. 

Roughly, it has to do with stewardship and dominion as well, placing the 
world we witness, real or virtual or worlding, under the subjunctive: to 
be human is to live within the semiotic of the subjunctive.

And here, within a specified virtual world, one carries out experiments 
telling or foretelling, floundered and foundered on the subjunctive - this 
these experiments might be taken as fundamental as well to any human 
project, if such there be. Perhaps this virtual world lacks a sense of, 
lacks the catastrophic; perhaps it is this lack which permits the what-if 
a discursive and reified operation. Perhaps, only just at our moment and 
in this configuration, perhaps nothing more.


CIAC on Second Life Art

Check this out - articles by Patrick Lichty on Second Front and Second 
Life art in general; Domenico Quaranto on my installation; a good article 
on Gaz' recent work; Fred Forest dans Second Life par Fred Forest; and
others. http://www.ciac.ca/magazine/sommaire.htm The whole magazine is 
really good; I've been looking through back issues.

More experimentation with Julu Twine:

Look closely and you'll see a red circular object, as well as a number of 
other shapes, dropping in steps from the sky back into the installation. 
Here is how it happened: Julu Twine rode the object (i.e. sat on it) as it 
revolved on the floor of the installation. The object has a Disappear 
script which requires it to rise 25m when an avatar is present. Since the 
rising is accompanied by the avatar, the rising is continuous until the 
avatar leaves the object; at that point, the object very slowly begins to 
sink back to its original position. Dropping records the sinking.

http://www.alansondheim.org/dropping.mp4

There is also http://www.alansondheim.org/julurising.mp4 - Julu approach- 
ing the object, sitting on it - at which point the object immediately 
begins to rise.

One can imagine an elevator system running on Second Life Physics - how- 
ever it might take a half hour or so for the elevator to return to the 
ground; not only that, but if you stepped on it somewhere up in the sky, 
you'd only go higher.

So a cheap rocket up and down, but the latter without passengers.




[ The following - rewritten - text was assembled from material used for 
the Intimacy presentation a while ago; it's fairly informal, but to some 
extent describes the relation of bodies, and my avatars in particular, to 
virtual worlds / Second Life. ]
