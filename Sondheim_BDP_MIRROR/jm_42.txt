breast

what did occasion this breast, this breast-writing, but image after image
splayed from glowing laptop screen, analog and digital camera, video, even
the subtlety of a light glance towards the glistening surface. o empty
pane, nothing reproduces, nothing _carries_ the luminous as your milky
flesh melts within voyeur and viewer. oh it is never possible, the images
turn dark, decay, empty, vaporize; beneath the surface, the _glowing_
remains imminent, eternal. so do i write to turn the eye inward, dream you
within these sayings, glistenings, moistness glazed suspended in pure pure
                                 space
