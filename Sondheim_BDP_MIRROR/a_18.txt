Travis VR



Travis moves through the worlds, there are consoles, moves to the con-

soles, crosses the levers. Travis pulls the levers, there are jungles 

and clouds, thin sprays of ocean in summer breezes, flying fish, the

jagged terrain of the moon Miranda, his childhood home, the molecular

surface of an unknown plant. Tired Travis releases levers, moves back-

wards, these dials mimicking old analog, feels the return to the sur-

face through backup, always the pleasure of backup. Forgotten worlds

rush by, consoles swimming, floating, air-borne in the midst of the

vacuum of space beneath the surface of the earth. Dim memories stir

Travis, taking a while through the backup, feeling an emergent end,

nearly there, always nearly there. Was there noise in the worlds, the

appearance of the new, hardly. What fit was the backup, what did it

was the backup, but an end, there was always that, lip or rim of phys-

ical reality, the One he'd say to himself, now almost there. A strange

creature slid across an orange sky turned hyperspace. Another pull of

the lever and things seemed all too familiar, was this the lip at long

last, but there was the lever to pull. He felt, well if this were this,

just one more backup. Felt just one more backup was okay. Felt it was

near and might as well backup. Backed up one more time. Was almost 

there.
