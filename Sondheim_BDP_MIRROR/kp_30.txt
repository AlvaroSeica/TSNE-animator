This Rutted Jagged World s/ms

(Here I'd add some partial-commands, things gone wrong, s/ms trailing 
sad flaps of flesh in the dust.)
(Here I'd add small arousals, peripheral girls and boys walking down the
street with beautiful bodies and sullen faces.)
(There would be miscalculations here, remainders gone askew, 404 errors,
files not found.)
(I'd place uneasy dreams of slabs of bodies here, ruffled at the edges,
all mouths speaking in silence.)
(Here I'd worry mistranslations, alternative misreadings and nonsense
in any language, Â¹ºÇ ÇÊÒË¡¾Óä¹Â Ã´Ç äÒ´¡Ê ËÊÒ´ ´··ÇËÂã.)
(Here I'd place bleak walls of cultures, curious and exotic customs, 
erotics of full-breasted island women, super-computer record-setting.)
(Here I'd place the fragments of an ego, stuttered mouths attempting
the speaking of an _I_ or maybe at least a simple phonemic saying.)
(Here I'd place memory and the constituting of everyone around me, I
try for the names and bodies, try for the voice and histories.)
(I'd find myself here, then efface the fragments.)
(I'd find myself here, then reassemblage into the vestige of the human.)
(Here I wouldn't be able to find the s/ms "trailing sad flaps of flesh
in the dust.")
(Here, I begin to remember "something about s/ms" that seemed "important
at the time.")
(Here, somewhat of a "wandering off.")
(Here, I'd look for nakedness, removal of quotations, no longer voices, 
or what's worse, noise "as if something were being said.")
(s/ms, mouths and nipples, [abcde], hurt me.)
