Less Mess with the Real:

"Other no less grandiose plans exist which may eventually be realized. We
could build a dam from Newfoundland to Labrador and thus block the cold
current which frezzes a vast region of the U.S.A. We could dam the Straits
of Gibraltar and exploit the enormous zones of fertile land at the bottom
of the Mediterranean. We could divert the warm Kuro-Siwa current ito the
cold sea of Okhotsk. We could create in the Sahara Desert a freshwater
lake which would influence the whole climate of Africa. We could deflect
southwards the great Siberian rivers and use their waters to irrigate the
deserts of Central Asia. This and many other plans have been worked out."
