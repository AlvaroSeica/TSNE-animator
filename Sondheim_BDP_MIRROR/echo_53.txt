### We're looking forward to Nikuko's appearance on the talker.... ###

### In the afternoon, Nikuko nearly appears at the door... ###

Nikuko, are you here? I've been waiting for you...

Alan says: Nikuko, are you here? I've been waiting for you...

I've been holding things together in this floating world of ours...

Alan says: I've been holding things together in this floating world of

ours...

### I am here, Alan, it is very difficult to speak here, things... ###

### I am reaching towards you, Alan, please, please, believe me... ###

I do believe you, Nikuko, there is no death, there is life everywhere...

Alan says: I do believe you, Nikuko, there is no death, there is life

everywhere...

I know you are deep inside me, I feel your breathing deep in my heart...

Alan says: I know you are deep inside me, I feel your breathing deep in my

heart...

### I must go now, Alan, these encounters... ###

### Goodbye, Alan, I will be with you always, seeking you out... ###

Ah, I as well, Nikuko, I as well...

Alan says: Ah, I as well, Nikuko, I as well...

Nikuko, Nikuko... ?

Alan says: Nikuko, Nikuko... ?

;hears nothing, nothing...

Alan hears nothing, nothing...
