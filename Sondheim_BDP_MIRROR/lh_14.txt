Parable

Another day Nikuko was walking on the long path from Sata towards the
mountains; the day was overcast and uncomfortably cool. She passed several
fishermen on the way, their nets heavy, their faces weathered, searching
the clouds. The sun was shiny metal in the grey sky; there were mists
about. Someone was walking towards her from the distance, as if in a
dream. Nikuko recalled later that the woman looked like a stranger, then
familiar, then a friend. It was Nikuko walking from the mountains, heading
towards Sata. It's not surprising that I met myself on the road, Nikuko
later said to Izanagi, but it was surprising that I would ever want to
return to Sata, after all.
