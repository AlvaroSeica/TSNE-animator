letter to me from me


did you ever wake up on the road, and think
everything in my life is a mistake,
I'm living out of cartons and sleeping on plywood
and the floor's never been properly taken care of,
the ceiling's got problems with stains where there might be
liquid or animals begging to get in, to this empty space,
without soul and almost without reason and certainly without
rhyme. well, this

is this morning's thoughts from indiana, wanting the cat
out of the *loft, the loft burned down or otherwise occupied
by some other people who are really nice and good, as I 
am not, as most people will tell you. these nice people
will live there with lovely rugs and furniture, and good
books, I'm not joking about this at all, and a sense of smiles
when they look at each other, a sense of smiles at least once
a day.

in the meantime maybe my life will simply disappear behind me, 
some smooth function catching up to my present, changing my life
into someone else's, forever.


*Brooklyn
