This word is just wasted. This word doesn't mean anything at all. This
word is garbage, useless, unpronounceable. This word is misspelled. Now
this word is superfluous, and this word is just for the sound of it all.
And this word is out of order. 

Again, this word is completely out of order, in all senses of the phrase.
This word, then, has been rendered useless. Or rather, this word has been
found and rendered useless. Since this word is completely obscure, no one
has any idea of its meaning. This word has no meaning, but this word is
nonsense. This word is worthless. This word has never been heard, i.e.
I've never heard this word. This word speaks volumes.

Oh, this word is much too obscene. This word means nothing to anyone. But
his word demonstrates the political economy of language when words become
superfluous. This word is superfluous. Yet this word is implicated in art-
for-art's-sake aesthetics. This word leaks all over the page. This word is
not a word, but a signifier. For this word is senseless, but not nonsense.
This word is yours alone. Now this word you've given to me, for no purpose
whatsoever. Now this word is lost.
