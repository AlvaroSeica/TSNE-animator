Nikuko draws a thread around her arm, just below

The elbow, it's thin, red, it's a division, it's a line.

The leg is marked as well, left arm and leg right,

Staggered dashes that would be parallel and posed.

They are slightly taut, so that the skin swells, lunar,

Around the moon of her taut body, and if kimono

Were wrapped and opened like silk and doubled boxes,

Near sleeves of flowers, like her arm or body.

Between the the threads, a golden twine connects

Clearly to an Alan placed in front of her.

There are flowers, pistils, stamens, across him.

There are stems, thorns, roots and leaves, across him.

The twine is there on or in the Alan.

A breeze strokes the tsuchi sign for earth,

A whisper moves the kire sign for cloth,

Speech appears, the sign of fire, threads its golden

Way across both bone and skin, the sky on fire,

Kimono shuttled on the earth, the cloth on fire,

Threaded Nikuko has closed her eyes, her neck exposed.



dead white alan lies in a bunch of clutter,

jennifer's broken smothered in dead white alan,

julu's sintered broken in dead white alan,

in dead white alan, look for nikuko, you'll find her.

he's been strung up, the cops have got him,

inside-out for jennifer's not quite there, who knows her age.

they rip his arms off so he can't type, tear out his tongue,

there's no program for him, disabled ugly alan.

something's got to give with julu, cops don't know just what,

but she's suspicious, maybe not even white or dead or alan,

just fucked and troubles brewing. then there's that nikuko,

alan's raped nippon, the second or third time over,

it's time to rip out throat and muscle, he screams jennifer,

julu, nikuko, nothing comes but foam and tendon.
