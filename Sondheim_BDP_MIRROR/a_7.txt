Begging





(Gifts, which are sociobiologically determined, which involve degrees

of reciprocity, gifts which are those of the spirit, those of the

flesh; which are those of one or another economy. Abject, gifts are

always a dissolution, possessed by neither one nor the other, external

to the hardened monetary economy of equivalences; your gift surrounds

me, breaths you into me, pervades me.)



What I say to you is that I am always open to your suggestion, even

begging to be corrected, supine beneath you, the language of this body

at the mercy of your own, your thinking through or across my presence:

and what would be transgression when the entire world is criss-crossed

or countermanded?... This attitude of delicate correction, purveyed by

tenuous connections, these ligaments of cyberspace, almost a tumescent

membrance of thought, thinking huddled against the vaginal opening of

the gaze itself...



_I am always already an offering,_ my mind a gift to you... (to the 

body of your thought, your thinking body, at one with the translucency

of my speech, long parole, the length of a release) - as if words ex-

plode into the air, as if history were the memory of explosions.



But what I say to you is that, like Shestov to Berdyaev, I am awaiting

your corrections, I welcome them gladly, and they mean nothing and 

everything to the world to me, as I am one with waiting upon thought, 

an entrance or portal to theory, the enumerations of worlds (or if you

like, domains, or if you like, languages, sememes as well). But I am one

with you, blend with you, my intercourse part of your own, my body 

arched back, thrust forward, for your reception, if you like, if it meet 

your pleasure, and for whom is the recipient, who is the gift, for whom 

is the giver, and for whom is the body.



Think yourself through me, strained by the tenuous nature of my texts;

my body is a sieve, thought only through your thinking of it, poor 

material world, not of my making, and, if it be your pleasure, not here,

not present, at all.
