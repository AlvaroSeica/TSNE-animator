Parable


something about this talking all the time to you
something about Buddha charging Nikuko, no wait it was the other way
around.
something about Buddha loving her smell, her damp odor.
something about sleeping when I reach the point of dizziness,
just as the earth goes around, then there's the forest
and Nikuko watching an insect, surely that's it.
she watches the insect and gets enlightened.
it happens all at once.
there's not much else she wants to do.
she's had it, that's all.
it's happened to her.
something about being much wiser now.
something about now that she's enlightened.
something about everything is just a little bit different.
it feels pretty much the same to Nikuko.
that's the way it's supposed to be, says Nikuko.
"to say" or "a word" coming from two parts meaning knife and mouth says
diligent Nikuko.
something about sufficiency.
