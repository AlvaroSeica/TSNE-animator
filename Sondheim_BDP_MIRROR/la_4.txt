After Meng Chiao


Shogi, and not a man in sight,
undertow beneath smooth water.
Carrying stones, addresses, beaches
of other shores. All things
have begged for their existence,
all things have answered. The man
walks on the bridge of stone,
nothing coupled, red flowers and 
bamboo. Shogi, and another man.
