the lovely image


please will you to http://www.asondheim.org/ and look for all the 
indianmaidmyperfecthome jpegs they will astound and delight they form a 
matrix of my new york city life in peace and in war you will perhaps be 
disappointed but perhaps you will find them lovely and perfect as they 
were when first i came across the beautiful views almost with tears in my 
eyes

they are brooklynbotanicalgarden and deanstreetandfifthavenue and i will 
say they are lovely, and far away from the tragedy of this country and its 
derailing and its atrocity, sometimes i will sit in the coffeeshop across 
the street and look up at my windows and think, yes, i live there, and i 
live there, i am sorry about the size of the images, they are quite large, 
but they retain the finest detail, they will not be there forever, please 
come and see my peace and kindness

please come and see my hope even though there is silence while images come 
to you from across the water in every direction, along every road

i am sad you will not look at my pictures please look at my pictures

you will not make me sad you will make me happy

you may smile at love while you wait the long time for the image and the 
image and you will have time to smile at love and to dream of hope and to 
hope

you will see of the lovely lovely image

after my death, i have been thinking about this writing



you would notice my death as an afterthought, peripheral topos; or rather, 
you wouldn't notice it at all. it would emerge, slowly, out of the mud 
into consciousness; someone else might say something, might send an obit, 
and that would serve as the fulcrum or divisor of event and time. but not 
for you, and for me only in the past anterior, as if i might have noticed 
what i could not during and after the fact, the passage.

it would change everything, this writing, the speaking and speaker of this 
writing, and of other writings that pass through my name, and through the 
names of others speaking my name, perhaps borrowing it in an area in which 
no return is possible.

the writing, the writing plural, writings, would become remnants, signs of 
a life, symptomologies for interpretation, and interpretations which i 
could never answer, which would remain in other discursive strata, back 
and forth, without my author/ity and for that matter, sourceless, 
something that may be a matter of pride for the interpreters, a dissection 
table perhaps.

the writing, all this oozing about death, this reiteration, inconceivable 
recuperation, would become uncanny, unheimlich, stateless, as if it were 
once again replete with the fecundity of speech, a paradox.

in my absence, in the absence of my jarring personality, it would be 
recognized for what it is, a continuous meditation by the reader as much 
as by the writer, something ongoing, something freed from my personality.

in this freeing the words would speak, as if my magic. they would be heard 
and seen for what they are: literature, philosophy, psychology. one might 
be heard to say, i knew him when, but that knowledge is of a shell, would 
be of a shell, and would be a shell. 

recognition would surely come, recognition of speaking and writing as an 
afterthought, recognition of a stranger behind one on the street, you can 
sense his eyes. 

the death would be forgotten in the reading of the writing, for what would 
remain would be just that, the reading, nothing more, nothing less, and 
the fluidity of a writing now always vulnerable, always on the verge of 
disappearance.

but there would remain this sensation, one might sense it as a shuddering, 
the interpretation would come later, and would require work. 

the shuddering would submerge in everyday life among the living of men and 
women still alive. the shuddering would later bring the writing to the 
foreground for you and newer readers and readers born after the time in 
which i died. 

you would know all of this, reading the writing i have written, after the 
death, after i am no longer writing, at least writing in the ordinary 
sense. you would write what you know.

"And just so, Jonathan and Jane"


When my grave is broke up againe
Some second ghest to entertaine,

http://www.asondheim.org/blackout.jpg

From Mary Magdelane they deign,
The light of Reason gone, and feign
To vanquish Language from the sane,
Just so the dredging of the Seine
Resultant cruise beyond the Main,
Beyond the Ghast, where Darkness reign,
The ghost or gast behest and Thane
And Lord shall mourn the pain
Within - Without, the Violent gain,

The Meek are weakened, slaughtered, stained,
Bound, nonetheless by blackness, chained.

And just so, Jonathan and Jane

genesis genesis redux revisited

The explanation:

genesis genesis redux is a reduction of the book of Genesis, the originary 
book from which the spiral of monotheism extends. Creation exists in the 
performativity of speech; "God says," which of course presupposes a 
language, sound and an atmosphere to convey it, throat, vocal cords, lips, 
teeth, and tongue to configure it.

"God says," and it is done, completed, vocalization into matter. But there 
remains, at the beginning, as if in reverse, the remnant, the speaking 
itself, the origin and material grounding of that language, Hebrew, 
Akkadian, Assyrian, Ugaritic, for example, from which creation ensues. 
Wherever the account begins, began, in whatever district, desert, forest, 
marshland.

A word is created only once. The creation of the word proceeds from the 
existence of language; language is always already there, just as 
information is: If we only had the means and patience to read it!

genesis genesis redux borrows and extends the materialization of language; 
it also works through the aesthetics of the Thousand Character Essay. 
Ellen Zweig and I have been translating this, it seems, forever, stumbling 
across difficult classical Chinese, without any background 'for this sort 
of thing.' In the Essay, a thousand different characters are used; the 
essay itself is a thousand characters long, and there is no repetition. 
One begins anew with each character, and here we are.

genesis genesis redux transforms the book of Genesis, and this is a better 
transformation than one I had previously completed, this is more accurate.

This transformation is, and must be, the originary text of language, and 
therefore must be Important, and a source for scholars of Revelation in 
English.

The words in genesis genesis redux are all unique; the programming below 
(with eliminate.pl a perl program by Florian Cramer, upon my request) 
takes the original text, such as King James would have it, and eliminates 
all redundancy. Every word is returned to its primordial uniqueness, 
regardless of syntax and placement. As such, the text descends into 
increasingly terse languaging, since the more common words are of course 
eliminated early on. By the end of it, the protolanguage code of all 
enunciation appears; the whole constitutes a supplication to language 
itself, my own production of the Word of God, with no emendation, with a 
purity that would have been well nigh inconceivable before the digital 
age.

Here is an accounting.
cat genesis.txt | tr -cs A-Za-z '\012' | tr A-Z a-z > yy
perl eliminate.pl < yy > redux.txt
where eliminate.pl is below:
#!/usr/local/bin/perl5
while (<STDIN>) {
     @words = split /[\s]+/, $_;
     @spaces = split /[\S]+/, $_;
     for ($x=0; $x <= $#words; $x++) {
         $word_count{$words[$x]}++;
 if ($word_count{$words[$x]} == 1) {print $words[$x],$spaces[$x+1]}
                }
        }
