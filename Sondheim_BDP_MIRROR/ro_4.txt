This is a sarinda from Afghanistan, quite old, heavily 
decorated. I had to set it up to play; it's incredibly
sensitive to the bow. Like its cousin the sarangi, the
strings are stopped by fingernails, not by pressing 
them to the fingerboard. The decorations are amazing.



Julu Did It

Julu did it she danced all around making males
come, to her, yes she did, they all came to her,
all these males, she made them come from her,
yes she did, she made them come around her,
she gathered them together, and made them, 
males coming everywhere around her, she did it,
she said I'll do it and she did it, 
she made them, she made them do it, 
she said I'll make them come to me,
she said I'll make them come and they all came,
they came to her, Julu did it, she danced all
around making males



Channeling

One of the very few times of my life I felt I was 'channeling' 
music from somewhere, someone, else.

Brooklyn

This is a short test video made today in Brooklyn; it also
is indicative of the iron fist of big money and corruption in
our neighborhood.

want you

http://www.alansondheim.org/wantyou.mp4

the ospreys were recorded at 96k and displayed frequency
peaks around 38k and below, and a few up to around 50k,
but the people moved at about .1k and developed entropic
heat in and around the calls which, to them, were 
inaudible, as was the camera devouring everything they 
had, or were likely to have. want you want you want you 
want you want you.


Channeling the Dead, Sarinda

http://lounge.espdisk.com/archives/909 (best listening)
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/deathch1.mp3
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/deathch2.mp3

I feel I'm channeling the dead; playing the sarinda, from
Afghanistan, is like no other instrument; the music I play
isn't from me, is like no other; I hear the voices of the
dead in the deeper strings, the chorus; I hear the cries
and lamentations of the living in the upper strings - and
I mean this literally, the instrument controls me, it's
haunted, spirits are living in it, spirits are speaking
through me, it hadn't been played in years, perhaps
decades, they were waiting for me, they are coming for me,
I've come for them, I've come to play their grief and
their sorrow, something takes me, takes the movement of
the bow, the sway of the instrument, it may be centuries
old, there is grief residing in it, anguish within it,
when I play the sarinda, I don't know who I am, something
or someone else, is moving the bow

I am in tears playing this instrument, trembling - it's
tearing me apart - I've been having twitches again -
something neurological - I've been to the doctor before
- have to go again - the music helps me along - cries
out to me - something -

my favorite accompaniment of all time,

osprey fledglings with sarangi

http://lounge.espdisk.com/archives/911 (easiest)
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/ospreys1.mp3
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/ospreys2.mp3

the fledglings were recorded at 96k, into the ultrasonics.
i accompanied them on solo sarangi.
they couldn't hear me; they were in eastern europe.
this is my favorite accompaniment of all time.
the sarangi is a beautiful instrument for the natural
world, and is a gift instrument to that world.
i am lucky to be able to play and accompany the ospreys.



Death and Sex

The lights were off and I knew secret 
deaths were going on and I was the 
country. This entry, concerned with de
ath, the loss of virginity, 
cathecting for a long time now; it was
n't death, and stemmed largely from 
projection. The tape was deathly expli
cit; E. C. ran the camera. We made 
an "inverse" of the tape, both deathly
 and in terms of mood. Now death, 
her saying I've had my eyes on you for
 a long time, later - now, 
intensity, hysteria, exhaustion, death
. I'm worn out, wear people out. I 
remembered all too well his death-wish
, mild deceit, and the feeling that 
I masturbated while falling dying; she 
said she'd place them on her death 
and ending in the real world, travel, 
fear. I traveled to England, was 
deathly extreme - we used CuSeeMe exte
nsively and including five 
projections, dealing with war, death, 
memory. For me, then I performed 
some deathly work which created a bit 
of dance that already created 
tremors; I want to release this but co
uldn't conceive, of technology, 
income, death, labor, art. We had it a
nd so forth, but the emphasis was 
the same - on language, death, death-s
ex dances. I read everything I could 
about Anita Berber. I was as old as th
e other residents. Working on ideas 
of pain, wounding, sex, sex as an abso
lute loss of a world, and it is 
these worlds, replete, that frightened
 me; I felt sex lurked in what 
seemed to be emotional catastrophe, al
ways already around the corner, and 
the only proof of Spirit I can think o
f was based on its preposterousness. 
A point, they were simultaneously life
 and sex, my self-disappearance had 
frontal lobotomies, people literally s
tarving for sex, or dying. In 
temple, by myself, facing sex and the 
world and the words "i'm tired" in 
Sprechstimme; they were words about se
x. But that line, secretly 
conservative? That I thought suicide, 
lived in sex always, there seemed a 
descent, fear, mumbling after. Somewhe
re the ringing of sex itself or 
rather the horizon of sex which lies i
n sex which we pray is not 
immediate, not soon. Then recognizing 
the way our own sex is present even 
in the most fundamental acts of the sc
attering of material culture, 
memories, afterwards, when you are yet
 another. And how worlds shatter, 
imminent, with sex! - What has been de
ath-sex dances. I read everything I 
could about Anita Berber and sex in vi
rtual worlds.

We just had sex and I still have the i
nternal mapping of the house burned 
into me.
