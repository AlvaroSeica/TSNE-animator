there are five holes in the shakuhachi, four in front, one behind
which is useful for the fundamental octave of course and more,
and more, you can slide your fingers for overtones, or slide them
for microtones, or bend your lips to various upper and lower degrees,
thereby lowering or raising the fundamental tone of the finger position
while carefully avoiding breathing too deeply in and out of the tube,
which is not difficult for me, since xrays today indicated something
in and out of I think it is the left lung, so I gotta go for more tests
to get the medical certification, whereas I'd rather go for antibiotics,
another big dilemma, but sitting upright, breathing slowly, I don't
have satori or another big dilemma, but I can get the shakuhachi sound,
then move my fingers wildly, as fast as possible, blurring notes like
unsatisfactory lightning until the embrochure loses its grips and 
the world goes back into silence and everything gets its name and 
I remember the five holes in the instrument, four in front, the one
behind perfect for raising the level of excitement, and while I play,
I avoid satori like hell, I don't wanna have nirvana ever, give me the
cycles of birth and death, they're far too interesting and I want to be
there when it all comes out

(and after it's over I wanna come back and think a bit, there's not enough
time and space in this or any other world)

(and where has the energy gone, kill everyone on this list, move on, form
armies, navies, run around the earth and water, circle til you drop)
