Kyberspace


The phenomenology of traditional space within a software application in-
volves a movement across directories, links, subprograms, or procedures. 
The individual using the application constructs an internal history file
which often is bi-directional, forward/backward. Lars Pensj|'s lpmud and
database (worked on also by Olaf Kolbu) offers a maze in which entered
directions (north/east/south/west) do not necessarily result in the abil-
ity to construct a _coherent_ internal representation or "mental map"
since a _random function is involved._ The maze consists of five rooms,
with an escape; beyond the escape, however, one may wander endlessly
among them, _as if the space were continually unfolding._

A _second wandering,_ by virtue of the random function, would produce an 
entirely different result.

Before continuing, I present a summary below of one of the maze rooms 
(maze3.c) - not the code itself (the summary is slightly modified to the 
extent I have also modified the maze in my reconfiguring the lpmud data- 
base library):
