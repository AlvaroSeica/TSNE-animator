General footnote - It is unclear at this time as well whether artificial
intelligence _necessarily_ implies silicon (i.e. ULSI) based entities,
since there are already attempts to implement biologically-based neural
networks. This work will eventually lead to a merging of organic and in-
organic modeling, in which case the notion that intelligence must be "bio-
logical" becomes moot.
