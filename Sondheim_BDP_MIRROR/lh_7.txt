I couldn't think of a better topic since the hangman disappeared. Here I
am writing you at midnight! It's as if everyone stopped breathing just for
a moment. I know I did!
218:413) Julu            01:10:00:00:05
Hey Jennifer, I didn't know you were on! I feel that the air's cleared
around here. If I hear the word "ballet" I'm going to throw up! Enough
already! It was a stupid conceit!
218:414) Jennifer        01:10:00:00:10
Yeah, a conceit - that's exactly what it was. A trope or lever to explain
just about everything in the world. As if you could squeeze blood out of a
stone. Nothing is farther from the truth.
218:415) Julu            01:10:00:00:12
Exactly - but truth is simultaneously centrifugal and decentered. It's the
lack of the eye, all that perspectival machinery. We're just coming to
grips with it.
218:416) Jennifer        01:10:00:00:15
Just like those pirouettes, as if there were a body at the center of them.
Her skirt kept flying up, and there was nothing there. An avatar, or woman
of Lacan. In masquerade, burdened by the lack, shattered.
218:417) Julu            01:10:00:00:18
Well, there's no more to it, and his writing avatar discourse itself is
getting stale. He's taken you and I around the bend, and meanwhile there
is e-commerce to think about, all that corporate supernumerary exchange. 
It doesn't appear anywhere in his work; he's completely ignored the poli-
tical economy of the Internet.
218:418) Julu            01:10:00:00:21
He's placed bodies in the way. The Net's about "streaming video, it's
about streaming music," and he's back there with a vision or version of
flesh and disappearance. He doesn't realize even the imaginary is disa-
ppearing - everything replaced by the monetary clot.
218:419) Jennifer        01:10:00:00:24
That gets back to his theory of the self as a coagulation - now the imag-
inary itself is a coagulation, running between flesh and machine, swollen
with flickering and competitive protocols. There are no rooms left for the
avatars, and even human speech is always already stolen speech - from
selves, machines, corporate entities which are themselves streaming.
218:420) Julu            01:10:00:00:29
Do you mean our days are numbered?
218:421) Jennifer        01:10:00:00:30
At least our conversations are.
