& coming down with mountains scraping my skin   & hanging rocks falling,
& pebbles, boulders   & rivers soaking me, leaving their beds   covered 
in algaes, & hearing there are other things in the world   & sadness of
asteroid life, & names lost crumbling on dark mattress   & my mouth full-
silted, & tree-crowns piercing the skull   & enormous pressure, steamed &
vapored metals, magmas sintered & blown   & i am at the center of this
darkening earth   & ending of all life & recognition
