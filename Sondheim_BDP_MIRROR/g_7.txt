Roots


I write because I can't come to terms with my past. I can't live past the 
60s, was slaughtered by the punks in the 70s, slept through the 80s, now 
my xy-chromosome generation abandons me. I've cauterized myself from 
every conceivable record of the past; traumatized by Vietnam, I would 
have fled, killed myself, rather than serve. That's not even a memory 
now, or rather, those upturned faces of the woman at Kent State or the 
Vietnamese shot point-blank. But the intensity, lines of flight of the Ho 
Chi Minh Trail, Patty Hearst's skittering across the United States, 
trails left by failed rockets, assassination bullet trajectories, smoke 
of burning refineries houses of unparalleled enemies everywhere, drugs 
dropped into the eyesockets of the dead: _play morris-dance across my 
chest,_ the nipples worn around the necks of imaginary soldiers: No 
matter say I, I'll not settle here. No matter, say you, there's no there, 
nothing but the talking, not even the stalking. I write because of this, 
because I can't stalk the past, shunt off the trail into the tunnels. 
Because that way madness lies. Because it may be a tissue of lies, but a 
tissue nonetheless, torn with the blood of future generations that won't 
know a trail of blood from the Unix path/net/u/6/s/sondheim home. Root 
for it, baby, root for it.
