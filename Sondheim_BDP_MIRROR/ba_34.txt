Airwaves

I am finally bringing in some local CB transmission, mostly weather-rela-
ted at the moment, but it's howling outside. There are airport transmis-
sions as well on 125.25 megahertz, and several local FM and AM stations. 
At night, I can get 880, WCBS, NYC news, sounding intense and out of place
against the rain and wind. My French is poor, so I listen to French 95.9
fm, always useful for tuning out. 

I want to track down the CB culture, the _oral_ culture, to the extent
that it's non-telephone based, the intimacy and a kind of _easiness_ or
informality I've never seen on the Net. I imagine it's boxed in with
Iphone, but I haven't had a touch of it, and computers are still larger 
than CB transceivers, which fit comfortably in the hand.

CB culture has died out to some extent everywhere, taken over in New York,
for example, by late-night racists and just plain lonely people, mixed in
with the roar of trucks, sadnesses and consolations. I picked them up; I
listened when I first moved to the City, until I couldn't take it any lon-
ger, sensing an aural invasion of space. This never happens on the Net,
which conveniently remains on the screen - in this sense, unlike CB, the
Net is _object,_ tied to technology, remote, and out of _touch._

(This won't always be the case; intelligent PDAs are surely down the road,
hand-held companions increasingly replacing the physical reality that en- 
cases them. But for the moment the difference is _there._)
