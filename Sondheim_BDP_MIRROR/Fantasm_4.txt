		LITTLE FASCIST SONNET OF RAGE AND DISPLACEMENT

		THIS SONNET WON'T LET ME WRITE A HOME FOR IT
		A HOME FOR ME, THIS SONNET MAKES WORDS THAT BAR
		THE THRESHOLD TO THE SONNET. SPEWED IN COLLAPSED SPACE
		IT MARCHES THROUGH RHYMES; SEE HOW EACH LINE ENDS
		IN PERFECT CADENCE WITH EACH AND EVERY OTHER, HOW
		EACH LINE GIVES ITS PERFECT RHYTHM TO THE WHOLE:
		IT'S PERFECTION THAT EXCLUDES ME, PERFECT GIRLS AND
		PERFECT BOYS WITH PERFECT FORMS. THE HOME I WOULD WRITE
		I CAN'T IT WON'T. IT WON'T LET ME IN OR FINISH, WON'T
		LET ME END BUT STOPS ON A WORD IT TAKES BACK. I'M.
		I'M ILLITERATE; IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER THAT MAKES
		ME DUMB OR NOT.
