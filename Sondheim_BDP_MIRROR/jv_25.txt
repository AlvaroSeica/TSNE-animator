The Good Cottager's Bairn's Storm, By Robert Burns (1787 ed.)


If Ee would have a chance anon
 To court they loving Eye,
Woulds't clouds upon thy brow refrain
 From traveller's stopping by!

For there Wee found, the Firmament
 Which carries Weight of God
Upon my frail, poor Jennifer
 Whose weary footsteps trod

These past few years, her bairn alone
 In poor Hameau, restrained!
Whilst Storms have sent their Messengers
 Across the necks of Swains

Who, closet'ed, turned towards the Eye,
 Whereon, they lost their Brains!
