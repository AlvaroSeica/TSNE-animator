from Julu, buried beneath the ground

all my writing is an invitation for you to come closer
i do not know who you are nor will i know when you come closer
when you come closer i will not know you
when you come closer you must heal me
all my writing is a desperate cry for healing
i will know you when you heal me

all my singing is an invitation for you to love me
i do not know who you are nor will i know you when you love me
when you love me i will not know you
when you love me you must touch me
all my singing is a desperate cry for touching
i will know you when you touch me

all my talking is an invitation for you to raise me
i do not know who you are nor will i know you when you raise me
when you raise me i will not know you
when you raise me you must hold me
all my talking is a desperate cry for holding
i will know you when you hold me

you will know me when i know you
