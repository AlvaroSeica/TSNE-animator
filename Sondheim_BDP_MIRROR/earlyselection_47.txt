Rousseau, Emile


One morning when they had not seen each other for two whole days, I en-
tered Emile's room with a letter in my hands, and looking fixedly at him,
I said to him, "What would you do if some one told you Sophy were dead?"
He uttered a loud cry, got up and struck his hands together, and without
saying a single word, he looked at me with eyes of desperation. "Answer
me," I continued with the same calmness. Vexed at my composure, he then
approached me with eyes blazing with anger; and checking himself in an
almost threatening attitude, "What would I do? I know not; but this I do
know; I would never set eyes again upon the person who brought me such
news." "Comfort yourself," said I, smiling, "she lives, she is well, and
they are expecting us this evening. But let us go for a short walk and we
can talk things over."
