The Waiting Room, Keeping the Record Straight





The time of the Apocalypse has not yet arrived because we have not sinned 

quite enough.

The Rapture has not yet arrived because the trains run close to schedule.

The Messiah has not yet arrived because the phone still works.

True Communism has not yet arrived because some people still want things 

that other people have.



Eternal Life will transform Humanity forever.

The perfect State will be absolutely still without Growth or Decay.

The perfect State will absorb all contradictions.

The most beautiful Woman in the World will fuck the most beautiful Man

and the second-most beautiful Woman.

The second-most beautiful Man in the World will fuck the second-most 

beautiful Woman and the most-beautiful Man.

The Lamb and the Lion will fuck each other because there will be no Age 

difference after they lie down.

Everyone will fuck and cum forever and they will lie there and cum 

and cum.



Everything about History will come to an End.

History will recount only the History before the coming of the End.

History will recount right up until the End itself and then History will 

have to come to a stop, but you might have someone recounting the History 

of the recounting which will come after the End.



Simultaneously, People will always Smile.

Their Smile will be genuine and meant for one another.

But it will not be an exclusive Smile because everyone can participate.

They will always Smile because they will always be Happy.



The Nighness of the End will always be behind them.
