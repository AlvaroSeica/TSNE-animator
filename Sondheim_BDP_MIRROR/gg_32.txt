"Interesting..."


Celine's "three little dots" are his little three dots that breathe his
words in and out like the suppurating body at the end of world war ii; and
I look at my three little dots and they're pretentious, as if there were
more to say (there isn't), as if I could continue on (I can't), as if
there were deeper thoughts afield (there aren't), as if a long and care-
fully prepared sentence ends in some new vista, clear day but storm-clouds
on the horizon (there are none)...
