Subject: another freighter...

this time i speak without capitals, quietly, so as not to startle it, the
freighter known as aurora, and there are no quotation marks, themselves
capable of generating considerable noise; it resides, no periods, out in
the harbor exactly -underlined- just where the desert falcon had been; 
they may be watching us now, in the middle of this extraordinary hard
freeze, nothing moving but, i tell you, the upstairs neighbors who may or
may not have been the beneficiaries of... certain things... absenting
themselves from this house, as i have written you before, they're nice
people really, one never knows who is behind what, but i ask you if two
freighters can be a coincidence, me online desperately with the rest of
the living world from this topstory small room, i can see it all, don't
say i didn't warn you, the ice is flowing back into the sea, hardening
itself against what i cannot say, but i have this premonition, it will be
vast as, see the black freighter, yes, black, too, see how innocent it
seems    from the depths of nova scotia, notice not even a separate
paragraph to whisper goodbye, nothing out of the ordinary, i tell you,
please, nothing whatsoever is going on
