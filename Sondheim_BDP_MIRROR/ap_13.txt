Paul, Sail On


If I gather up, will you bury me, will you bury me if I gather up
Your ambergris, your bronze helmet, your amber, your bronze
Swollen by river's wake by cavern opening cavern awakened by the river's 
  swell
Motivated by gutted reeds cut stuttered clay, read in gorgeous monuments
  gone motivated
If I lie with you, will you lie with me, if I lay with you will you lay 
  with me
Near the pregnant cow near the gutted horse near the emptied house 
  by the coward's prayer
Through the dim dark night by the knight's despair by the armor there
If I wash for you by the river's edge and I wash for you by the same
  edge of the river
Where down the river there is a gathering of knights and women, I think
  they are celebrating Telipinu at the moment

Yes, I will lie with you, I will lay with you, I will sacrifice, you will 
  sacrifice
Your horse, your cow, yourself, against my golden hair, my eyes of blue
Sparkling in the waters pooling by the marshes, waters sprinkled
  with blood, swollen with whitened
Bones you have slaughtered, your bones you have slaughtered
While I, while I
  I'm leaving for Telipinu.
