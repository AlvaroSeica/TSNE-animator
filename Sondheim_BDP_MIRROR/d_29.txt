Stories





It was a bad story, it was the worst story he had ever read. The Countess,

sable fir, dark and gloomy eyes, alabaster skin, had returned with her

mother's lover to the birthplace of her illegitimate child. It was there

that the dashing man in black, somewhat severe but devoted, appeared as an

apparition for the very first time. Franz, she was heard to murmur, as the

audience went silent, waiting for Clara's plaintive reply. 



Long ago and far away, he had read this and other stories and they had

carried him to other lands, had carried him in their soft arms and beau-

tiful breasts, a bright shining red and gleaming mouth, leaning against

the sun intense with every intention of completing its daily round. 



These were the forfeitures of the biogeneticists, the occasions, surely, 

of age-old and weary patterns installed long before they had arrived on 

these poor shores.



Hungry, my  mind travelled the length of my body in an involuted sphere, 

companion to Volvox, yearning for the denouement of the noise of the 

world, anything but the noise, abjured, ignored, by the Countess.
