I get notes. What's wrong, Jennifer's gone violent. Other notes, why at-
tack John Cage. John's got his problems. He terrifies me. I can't and
won't tell you how much he terrifies me. He comes out of terror. He
pronounces. What he says is beauty truth. There is no discussion with the
koan. Jennifer doesn't attack Cage.*

Jennifer doesn't attack Cage but would with her claws. She'd strike Cage
in the face, tear his cheeks to ribbons, retreat into her corner. The
corner's made of cement. There are brick ceilings fifty-five feet up. The
ceilings are vaulted. There is huge weight upon them. Jennifer has been
there, has seen them. There are two ramps to the left. There are enormous
circuit-breakers for the bridge. Jennifer could turn the lights off. Jen-
nifer could ruin the bridge. Jennifer could pull and pull with all her
might.

I get notes. What's wrong. Jennifer mouths through her nipples. Her body
speaks. She jumps on Cage and pummels him. She saves her energy. Cage
falls into brickdust, water, mud. She's on top. She's screaming.

Jennifer's voice carries for a fraction of a second fifty-five feet up to
the very top of the vaulted ceiling. Jennifer's voice carries for a frac-
tion of a second, crashing down.
