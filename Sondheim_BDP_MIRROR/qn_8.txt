the useless chant of hypnotic y-c you

I wake up in the middle of the night with nightmares, all the time, beat- 
ing myself up. I'm constantly haunted by death, regrets, finality: today 
for example - is this the last class I'll ever get to teach? Since my 
archives are scattered among two universities, I feel like dead man 
walking; I'm already packaged, what I haven't accomplished I'll never 
accomplish. Finality is accompanied by thuds. My current music archive is 
at the resurrected ESP-disk site - a company that disappeared decades ago. 
My fiftieth high-school reunion is, I think, now, and I dread the thought 
of going, choosing to die remembered elsewhere. In my bar mitzvah book - 
yes, we found that going through things at my father's home - among the 
pictures of dance/prance/pray, I put a picture of the explosion of the 
first hydrogen bomb. The paper is yellowed, as if cosmological physics 
suddenly became antiquated. I am waiting for my friends to die. How can I 
speak to Vito Acconci for example of the hurt he caused me; everything is 
already dust. Or my father, whose psychological abuse - which he was in no 
way responsible for - how can he understand at 96, what happened to me - 
how my depressions, unbearably out of control, began in relation to his 
temper and my fears of just being alive? I tried suicide as a kid, mixing 
iodine with milk, which turned out to be an antidote, which is the story 
of my life, and the suicide attempt was hidden and probably not that 
serious anyway - another regret. Now I'm in the midst of yet another panic 
attack, it's almost 5am, I'm teaching the last class ever tomorrow, which 
won't be any better than the others in this course, another sleepless 
night - thinking about Rwanda, the unutterable violence we do to one 
another, the fury of this species. And I hypnotize, mesmerize, myself into 
the granularity of absence, remaining alive, worried constantly about 
Azure and her survival after me, knowing I will never know, that absolute 
finality, that the thud, will create a barrier forever, that I won't even 
recognize the barrier, that I won't be. I worry my collaborators as well 
are disappearing - I'm not surrounded by a kind of critique any long, 
critique that kept me on edge, functioning; now my music is freak-music, 
my writing freak-writing, my Second Life installations freak-stallations, 
stalling for time, for the imminence of immanent death. You don't want to 
be me. My student, who I worry about, writes she can't make class today, 
her bf has to go to the VA hospital, she's missed an appointment with him 
already, he has cancer

What if I had opened the wrong file? I know for a fact - from everything 
I've been told - that Derrida would have wanted to hear this; I've never 
been so sure of anything; it's a given; it would have filled an irrevoc- 
able gap; a hiatus signaling the mathesis-to-come; it would have been an 
insistent completion; where nothing had been recognized; where nothing 
would come in relation - the future anterior; the missile striking down; 
cauterizing - differend and differance; the finality of the differend; of 
course: is not equivalent to death; is identical to death: is that signa- 
ture which always already remains elsewhere inscribed: this work would 
have - in other words - other sounds - sutured the signifier: displacement 
towards materiality under erasure; what is under erasure is always already 
uncanny; within the imaginary; you are listening to the imaginary; the 
imaginary is always the file; always the right file; whatever is opened is 
the right file; the right file is the right file-for: that is; for someone 
- for something - intended: this is the intended file: the open file is 
always the opened file: always the intended file: whatever is; is intended

Jazz Lounge prelims -

Myk, Azure, and myself playing. We're playing tomorrow night at the Jazz 
Lounge -

http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/rh4.mp3
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/rh3.mp3
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/rh2.mp3
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/rh1.mp3

So this was a departure, Myk on acoustic steel-string carbon-fiber guitar 
- I'm no the usual various including kamanche which I probably won't bring 
- but the rest is there - more jazz-oriented maybe - a kind of mellowness 
- maybe the attempt car-bombing - maybe just the teetering of worlds - in 
any case, come tomorrow night if you're in the vicinity - if not, or even 
if you do, have a listen to these. By the way, the poor recording is the 
result of very soft music and very loud outside noise - and our place was 
at maybe 84-85 degrees at the time - Alan


Some recording from Jazz Lounge gig tonight -

Well for one thing the other group didn't show and for another, the 
recording - which I did - turned out largely unusable except for the 
following excerpts which give a fairly good idea of what went on, with the 
exception of Azure's songs - these didn't come out at all. What I think 
happened was that subsonic stage and other floor movements resonated with 
the corner we played in - a kind of wolf-note effect below the range of 
human hearing, but not below the range of recorder compression. The result 
was literally impossible to listen to - lots of thumps and things unheard 
but sensed, taking out the music. After using graphic equalization, hard 
limiting, normalization, hiss reduction and editing, the following is what 
resulted - on it you'll hear Myk Freedman, guitar, and myself, oud and 
cura cumbus in some fairly weird combinations. Everything else had to be 
scrapped. But this stuff's good -

one eternity to another

a message from somewhere, and somewhere sounding the truth
a mask muffling the sounds
harmonics proclaimed from loudspeakers mounted on the tallest masts
in the mist, disembodied sounds, the atmosphere's subtle movements
masses of clouds and the distinct smell of musk, the warm air within
must muffling the sounds, as if chimes murmured the world's bleak end
the most of nothing as comparisons were fruitless, the soundings

the sonde reflecting invisibility, nothing without reception
the sound awaiting its turn on the turning vagaries of winds and clouds
sending and transporting waves, cargoes of particles, unmarked memories
in the sand, everything, inscribed from one eternity to another

they would have replied, sync among worlds, forming worldings
sync sent, the upheaval of universal space
universal spaces struggled, mumbling, unheard, and sank
the sink absorbing what had come before, nothing had come before
nothing was sunk, nothing mumbled, nothing had come before

(the synod 
a bond among them
so fond of thinking, nothing ever unthought, unthinking of nothing
harbors and ponds, the tallest masts by the shores of endless seas
sod and barriers, no one presencing, expecting, no denouement

Homeless and inworld


Lost my place in SL a while ago
Just happened when permissions changed
Distrust land, land gets you nowhere
Carry your stuff with you, wherever you go
There's no place to rest, no place to stretch out
Me, I like to stretch out, talk with anyone around
No one's around in these vacated lands
No one's got permissions, least of all me

Everyone's bellies are full of prims
They don't even have to put them away,
Me, they're just what I got on my back
Look at me, falling from the sky

Empty's the world, the first and the second
They're one and the same, busy hands at work
They take pennies from the little guy
The rich get rich, the poor get you know what

The coffers overflow in first and second lives
All money's virtual, wherever it's kept
I've never seen a coffer, wouldn't know if I did
But if something overflows, you can bet there's money there

Wait, I've got a few more lines to go
Wearing the stuff I own slows me up a bit
Want a glowing prim, just give me food
Or shelter from nothing at all, I'm just tired of falling

(thinking about SL, not in terms of RL or extrapolation -if such be 
possible - a crude, close to useless, outline below)


deliberately mistaken ontologies of life-worlds


"The SL space is almost always treated as a simulacrum of real life - by 
the creators as well! But as an abstracted mathematical topology, it's far 
more than that; others will take it farther in the future, already are. I 
also want to discuss being-in-mathesis, beyond the SL 'standard' represen- 
tation."

SL: [describe] = 2 [split choice]
0:
RL: [explain] = 1 [given]
