Alan says: i will start with my name and end without it
i'm ashamed of my name of what i have done here
done here and elsewhere in america in latvia
in germany in virtual city in estonia in arenaland
where i have misbehaved in deep misbehavior
:cries i can never absolve myself i have no freedom
:weeps i can move neither to the left nor right
:whimpers I can ascend the depths descend the heights
cry my beloved homeland, weep lands of mothers and fathers
call me forth and call me back towards the winter walls
towards the wolves and foxes towards the merlin and eagle
for the eagle shall destroy the server and the wolf the client
i weep for nothing has prepared me for this coming forth
this coming towards the horizon of darkness
i carry this within me i break myself against it i log out
my name obscure see that thing there is weeping
those shoulders hunched the head bowed the folded body
bowed the arms and legs bowed the neck the torso crushed
it lies there it is a stain it folds up it disappears
the stars go on it isn't for them
it isn't for the sun or moon either it isn't for the air
it has wound itself tight it has spiraled into control
spiraled: into control
in estonia it is gone from me in germany it is gone in latvia
in arena land in lithuania it is gone from me in america
it has never been in america in virtual city
it has never been anywhere and will never be anywhere
it is gone weeping just as one might say
"He is gone from the city and maybe has left the country"
"And quit, I think he's quit now, I'm almost certain."
