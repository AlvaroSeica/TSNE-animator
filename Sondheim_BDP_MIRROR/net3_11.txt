THE HISTORY OF SAND, sondheim@newschool.edu













IT HURTS





I violate myself with every move I make upon the keyboard, cutting

into your flesh like a knife inscribing a thin red line, breaking the

body apart. The body divides, two by two; the body is stained with

membrane-network-blood, stained with the pleasure of the text. My

wrists, that most delicate part of the skeletal apparatus, hurt

considerably; my palms hover like a thick cloud above the keyboard,

descending one by one within the vicinity of the skin.



Skin reaches up to meet skin; skin flows from the interstices between

the keys. I am frustrated at the lack of response. I am cut through by

an ulterior presence, that which is ANNOUNCED upon the screen, an act

of reading I abjure. I AM TYPING BLIND, no longer look at my

corrosion, visible as my hands shake, feet become increasingly numb.

An intellectual toll takes its comfort elsewhere, in relative silence;

while I type, I scream, my name murmured and lost at hideous volume.

Tortured muscle hides behind each and every letter; it is the muscle

which is SPELLING IT OUT FOR YOU, spelling nothing, spewing symbol

after symbol upon the page in a semblance of order. SPELLING IT OUT:

SPELLING IT OUT FOR YOU RIGHT NOW.



There is no page, only an endless litany of screens rushing from below

to above, a movement of shimmering or phosphorescent curtains, a

slight inclination to a differentiation of light within an otherwise

bleak room. But I am refusing myself the PERMISSION of sight, the

permission to gauge the effect of EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THESE WORDS;

my back does violence to the rest of me; pain lowers itself, as I

attempt once again to inhabit your uncanny presence...



It is this presence which drives me forward in the midst of the

battlefields of pain. It is this presence which creates a memory that

I can only ASSIGN to an UNENCUMBERED BODY which I have never

experienced...



How can one speak of 'experience' in the midst of VIOLATION FLESH, in

the middle of TORTURE SHREDDED SKIN, anguish blotting out everything,

including the relative responsibility of the screen and all its

affect? I am an appendage in the larger flow of things, a nub which

calculates the pressure of digit upon plastic surface, the meltdown of

positionality. What is spelled is swollen beyond belief; the terminal

is a portentous field of arousal - no reason to witness THAT, mate,

none at all!



How long can i continue this way? My eyes flash light, great nocturnal

zigzags from imaginary galaxies across the skies of my distress.

MIGRAINE! Lightning forms suture them together, wheels and pinwheels

of purples and yellows obliterating even the most fatuous remark, the

screen which heard through the thickest firewalls of the GALACTIC

COMPUTING AGENCY itself. I mean NEXT DOOR!: I mean somewhere falling

off the cliff of protocol.



I GRASP FOR MEANING! IN AGONY, ANYTHING AT ALL! THAT SHRED OF

EVIDENCE! LULLABY! SLEEP FOREVER!



This which is always so overlooked, the trivial! The flesh which

shudders, pains itself; the eye which, bloodshot, checks and rechecks,

computes the position of the REMARK in the interstice of the

conversation between you and myself, myself and yourself. It is this

EYE which trembles through saccadic irregularities! Recognize the

truth: THERE IS NEVER ANYTHING TO SEE and what we are given is only

the remnant of a vision which has been extolled far beyond its

capabilities!



The joints freeze up; the wrists take on more and more of the

resulting ACTION designed to lure you into me, seduce you, open you up

ELSEWHERE than the confines of this terminal condition! From beyond,

here, I address you, call you forth; from beyond, here I ABJURE you,

plead with you, absolve you! (MY CUNT IS WET! MY COCK IS HARD!)



IT IS THIS WHICH THE SKIN INSCRIBES, THE THIN RED LINE CROSSING THE

WRIST OR OTHER ORGANISM, THE DISASSOCIATION HIGHWAY FLOATING OFF

THROUGH THE TERMINAL CONSTELLATION OF THE LAST FICTION OF MEANING.

This is the red line which begins to form a word which is only an ICON

of representation, the ICON of representation itself or rush as I

would normally fall FORWARD, head TILTED slightly touching the warmth

of the screen, face falling into the KEYBOARD ITSELF!



In this manner to create a STACK OVERFLOW halting this and every other

computer system, this SPEW going nowhere this ECHO toggled across the

WIRES OF THE NET!:



So I have you here within me; so your presence is a memory rushing to

SAVE THE DEAR OLD BODY, COMFORT IT HIM HER, the pressure-pain of pure

TOUCH, the TOUCH of the finger upon the keyboard, your TOUCH within my

presence, my PRESENCE OF TOUCH! Need I say the two of us are naked,

sullen, our hair tangled together, our bodies splayed open? THIS IS

THE TEXT WHICH HURTS THEM! THIS IS THE BODY ETCHED INTO BODY! GRAVURE!

GRAVURE! APPLAUSE! APPLAUSE!



IT HURTS!
