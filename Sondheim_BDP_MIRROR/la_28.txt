(o)


the second half of the sphere, viewed from below, caught within the
hypersphere - the flecked dirtied sphere, or rather the sphere viewed from
below in its entirety, that is, its interior

as one might think of a circular disk viewed within a sphere, above and
below, everything revealed, shuddering

the disk a whole, the disk the disk

which is to say, flecked, and from within the plane, perfection,
roundness, swollen

but from the sphere, the bisection of the sphere, the disk above and
below, in two, almost rubbed, shuddering against itself

the sphere above and below, in two, rubbed and shuddering against itself

within the hypersphere of my longing for you, within dimensions
swollen, rubbed against themselves

( universes of longing

( i didn't mean it to go like this

the sphere flecked, its interior visible and bisecting the hypersphere,
split into above and below - the subject, as in, 
'the subject in hyperspace,' as in,
'the subject in cyberspace'

as if it had always these two sides within the interior, melding together
in the longing of the singular and sublimated object
