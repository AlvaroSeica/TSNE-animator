Talker Room Description


i'm desperate for this place to forget everything. i don't want memories
here, the sword which cuts, curved jewel of compassion; i'd settle for
mirrors, effacing all of us, turning the world into ghosts, always the
pleasure of broken times before and behind us, always a dream of purity.
i'd wear the kimono, walk the hundred-stones in absolution, pass blind
jizo that i'm sure predate buddha and all things in this world's slaughter
and decay. this room has beautiful corners, where you may hide, blankets
and cushions in comfort, and nothing will ever hurt you, nothing will
ever hurt you, nothing will ever hurt you, nothing will ever hurt you,
nothing will ever hurt you, nothing will ever hurt you, nothing will ever
hurt you
