 we're beginning this talk as if it were coming 
from A and M, and therefore something should come together between the two 
bodies separated by a serrated division, vertebra one among other. pain is 
this logging-out, is the collapse of the backbone, the melting or melding 
of the body as it begins to disappear.the body's not here either, the body 
is a square, is a playing-field, the body is a holding-pen.the i is a 
stream of i's, of eyes, these appear as if it were, but just imminent, as 
if just momentary, just for a minute.drying, in other words a stain or 
residue, we can say a conversation is a drying, a drying-out.in other 
words, you're saying this is dust, this is red dust, this is a failure or 
faltering, this blows away.it's already no longer here.

one can considered the order as an inscription, an imperative: the body 
hanging from bone, the bone as bone-order, as a cleared and proper body. 
you might log into this, you might log into me, you mgight log out.it's 
not here, the body's not here. the holding-pen is where it begins to fall 
apart, where pain dominates. i'm exhausted now, i'm not making any sense. 
tthe I changes to i.eyes can't hold up the body. they're not bone. eyes 
begin to fall apart, to take the backbone apart. and it goes limp, it 
doesn't do anything, it's jstust a pool, it's damp, it's drying.so this is 
drying, drying-out, this is a crackling, a dust-bowl or dust-storm.this 
blows away, this crinkled,. pain is like that, pain dries up, pain 
disappears. i disappear too. the body disappears.

playing melodica

http://www.alansondheim.org/melodica1.mp3 with reverb
http://www.alansondheim.org/melodica2.mp3 with reverb
http://www.alansondheim.org/melodica3.mp3 with reverb and pitch shift

yes, short of breath, but then a bit of the baritone
more experimentation, heading towards organ-saxophone
but thinking about shakuhachi which is unfair to both instruments

child companion reason period blessing melody
tiny mournful signal calling in soup of melody
and eate him with great melody. And so when they haue
nor grimmer sound than melody,
girldepressing melody of girlgimmick-girl girl girled stiffth
fast and furious; the melody is absurdly simple, repeated with

o violence! o melody!
of o violence! o melody!

i speak, language disappears into melody. there is a difficulty with 
melody just as there is a difficulty with cleverness. Cleverness is a 
tiny mournful signal calling in soup of melody,
called a 'haunting melody,' you can never forget it, 
everyone. you may find your fingers tapping out the melody 
or your day on melody.
producing the melody of a sparrow
producing the melody of Brahma,
the brutal melody of death and mourning ...

wwo hypnagogic, uncanny, tulips


http://www.alansondheim.org/hypnagogic.mp4 (silent)
http://www.alansondheim.org/wwo.mp4

began as dream or hypnagogic imagery, transforms within the pressure 
of going to bed, hypnagogic imagery on the way to ... accompanied by 
vivid eidetic or hypnagogic imagery: "Some hackers report by dreamwork, 
by eidetic imagery, by hypnagogic imagery, by imagery at poetry, 
poetics, hallucinations, hypnagogic imagery, and meditations." Nikuko 
falling asleep: My dreams are hypnagogic; there is metal at work, and 
sickness, hypnagogic imagery, trance phenomena, orgasm, "emotions," 
that Jennifer will come to me, or hypnagogic imaginaries.

hfighters are 
chastffffjjjjjjjfighters are 
chastising the bombers. the bombers have been compared to beautiful 
flowers. if the bombers are fklowers, they are tulips.
 the bus is a disguise. the bus is filled with bombs and munitions. the 
rtargets are very dangerous. the targets are cars. the cars are 
super-obvious.such a magic has never been seen before in this or any other 
world.
it is always dizzying watching magic.
two is always better than one, two is the perfection of one
 no, it is true, i cannot see now whatever it is I have been doing. or to 
whom.
yes, somewhere there is.
it is full of danger and it is full of delight. 
now it's an issue of meditation.

the bombers are coming in for a landing. the bombers are being chased. 
fighters are chasing the bombers. if the bombers are flowers, they are 
roses. there are trees and a bus most likely a school bus. the bus is a 
target in the trees.h the cars are ovbvious. they are every obvious. we 
will kill the cars. we will kill the buses. the buses are super-cars.
the woman flies incrediby ly high above the clouds. she turns and twists 
and wouldn't you know it, a kind of magic issuecomes forth. when 
there is the possibility of one, there is the 
possihbilitygilfbilibility of two
and there is such loss when i am moving blidlhy omomindlhyy in 
this world of lfflight and fancy.
\\somewhere  there is a sometime, is there not.
and i is true that it is very dangerous, that is t is fulll of danger.




We are stardust


'We are stardust' from which everything, all philosophy, proceeds, a 
timing and process that is always coming to an end. So we are vast, we are 
communal, every atom from another source, another distance, every atom 
silent as to history from which we draw only this, that history is silent, 
that our micro-histories go against the grain, are retardations, are the 
source of pain, of holding back, as if there were beginnings and 
demarcations evident in Being, and as if becoming were a universal law. We 
are stardust, we have already returned as such; at the edge of the 
universe our faces and bodies live and project, towards that Being and 
becoming, we are observers of the cinema of disappearance; it is ourselves 
we witness blurred out in the heat-birth of the early universe, it is 
ourselves that awaits the word of our dissolution.

From this is everything, and there is nothing else, the source of our 
despair and inscription - every inscription an alignment of atoms and 
molecules, every description the appearance of a permanent rearrangement. 
Pain mutes this, pain is the only truth, of stardust, of the absence of 
accountability, of the onslaught of the unaccountable and unaccounted-for.

We are stardust, and it takes this, in the middle of the night, this 
forth-coming, to proclaim what remains of philosophy; even the digital 
does not escape its material foundations ...

It would say unto you, it is languor, it is sinking, it is neurasthenia 
that reveals and revels in, the truth, which is that of a longing, of 
which death and its escape form only a surface phenomenon. For this 
longing inheres, is inherent in the very project we set ourselves, which 
is that of coagulation, and beyond coagulation, form and inscriptive 
processes bearing the familiar fount of Aristotelian logics and laws of 
distribution, so that we may take account, so that we may be accounted-for 
- it is this accounting, this belief in accounting, that grants us 
meaning, beyond that of clean and proper reproduction, a meaning which for 
us means, that we are more than stardust, that we are surplus, beyond all 
accountancy.

Such is the inauthenticity of our chaos, that engorged on signs and 
symbols, abjection rules in fact and fancy, along with the trope of the 
missing woman, just beneath the surface, beneath any surface whatsoever, 
that we believe we construct for ourselves, or that we believe we have 
found and foundered upon.  We are stardust and we can never, always 
already never, reconstruct ourselves, our pasts, our histories, the 
groupings of our histories, the dualities of any two particles and their 
respective orbits, one among others, many among many. For I say unto you, 
we know not our own substance, and without this, our destiny falters, 
disappears; we live within the one remaining symbolic, that of the false 
memory of a permanent loss, which is a permanent loss. Thus I say unto 
you, it is said unto me, but it said by no other, other than what I am 
saying, to to no other, other than that I am hearing. We are stardust, we 
are nothing else besides.

We are stardust, we are nothing else besides.


" We are stardust
We are golden
And we've got to get ourselves 
Back to the garden

[...]

We are stardust
Billion year old carbon
We are golden
Caught in the devil's bargain
And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden "

(Joni Mitchell)


we are also a generation
that knows the truths about annihilation
when meaning falls out and shatters on the ground
when the ground calls out and dies on meaning's shatter

we are stardust we are leaden
we are walking Armageddon

We are leaden; I say unto you we are borrowed time, we borrow the uncanny, 
we are borrowed dust, we organization information, information travels 
from dust to dust, information deteriorates, we erect potential wells, we 
are potential wells, potential wells are tunnels, we tunnel among us, we 
are always already under erasure, we are always already within the erasure 
of the sign of erasure. I say unto you, we are among the first to 
recognize there is no salvage. We await your planetary notice, this will 
come but among us all, the physics are impossible, inconceivable, the 
physics are the physics of stardust, the physics are the physics of death. 
This is within speech and without speech, the physics are the physics of 
death, and speech murmurs, the invasion of quantum noise, speech murmurs 
we are walking Armageddon.

the plea

http://www.alansondheim.org/saveme.mp4
http://www.alansondheim.org/saveme2.mp4

what will save us, Jennifer asks, how shall we survive, where can we turn, 
what is to become of us, what is our future, what will you see when I die, 
what will become of you, what will become of the species, where has our 
history gone, what happens to our dust, our molecules, our atoms, what 
happens to our forms, our records, our data, our speech, the recordings of 
our speech, the preservation of the recordings of our speech, what happens 
to the prions and viruses, the phages and the bacteria, the parasites, 
what happens to our sun and our planets and our lives, to whom shall we be 
speaking, how shall my mind continue without the service of a god, what 
happens to our demons when our minds dissolve, corrode, decay, corrupt, 
Jennifer asks, what happens when we can no longer hear your answers, can 
no longer hear our answers, can no longer hear ourselves, what happens 
when the memory of my mother with her book and my father with his fire, 
when these are gone and the sound of the mercury light switch is gone, and 
the luminous glow of the afternoon and the mighty trees are gone, and the 
moon is no longer there, and the sun murmurs its planetary nebula, and the 
plasma disappears and the glow disappears, and there are no eyes to see 
it, no ears to hear it, and where are you among us who shall save us, oh 
save me, who among us will keep their promises always based on 
forfeitures, who among us will be among us, asks Jennifer, where shall I 
be, what can turn me around, what can provide the loving canopy of soft 
nestlings and the presence of my friends of all times and all places, what 
will become of us, what will hold us back within the world of the living, 
will nurture and nourish us, will feed us and clothe us, ah, I am done 
for, says Jennifer, I am already half gone, I am already two-thirds gone 
and three-quarters gone, ah, cries Jennifer, save me, save me, save me

urban deterioration

http://www.alansondheim.org/blocknoise.mp3

we now have a sound meter documenting the construction
noise from the arena. we're way over par. blocknoise
presents the noise from various distances; the c-reading
is low-noise. my nerves are shot; I'm seeing a doctor
for anti-anxiety and sleeping pills, and a pulmonologist
to try and figure out what to do about my deteriorating
breathing.


Saddening

http://www.alansondheim.org/saddening.mp3

Being at the beginning of the Interrupt 2 event at Brown 
University, I am realizing how sad letters are, and I 
play this tune to show that.



interrupt 2 gathering

i just want to say my pulse-rate is okay, 
but i do not have the measurement. and my voice seems
at a proper volume to be understood, but i did not bring
my db meter. i remain unsure about the state of my 
exhaustion, i am positive i am far too tired to think
clearly about this. there are people around me here in
coffee-heaven who are doing little to keep me awake,
although one of them sounds like a white-house intern 
to be; he was careful in his speech. given my typing,
i am sure to offend someone when i release the keys and
begin the choking process of talking for five minutes,
which is what has been hammered into me by my 
instructions. oh wait i just saw someone i know. wait,
i don't know him a mistaken but there are two people
hugging in a distance. everyone here has someone to do,
including a woman talking about donna who is not here,
but who is now the victim of a report, by which i mean,
just there, the name 'donna' appears. the television to
my left says 'ouch! text me!' i will.

part 2, i just texted the television which has refused
to reply, instead offering a comment on 'frozen beef.'
i continue to write into what i consider 'the lagoon.'

At Interrupt 2 and the noise thereafter

http://www.alansondheim.org/AS-CF-Sun.mp3

Chris Funkhouser, flute

Alan Sondheim, harmonic minor and valveless chromatic harmonicas

this was the first time we played together with flute and harmonica, that 
is, and I've been noticing, having returned fromInterrupt 2, that my 
typing has somehow goe from bad to worse, and I;m wondering if this is 
early onset dementiia or an issue of stres; certainly the keyboards 
haven't changed over the past fourdays, but the typing has turned to what 
might be considered an almost chidish scrwal. sooner or later I'll just be 
able to communicate with music, if that. in the mentaime I was interviewed 
by the NY Daily News in regard to an email I sent desribing the noise in 
our neighborhood, which is out of control, the sresult of construct that 
takes no responsibility for building an NBA arena in the middle of a 
residential neighborhood, soething we fought for years and lost. At least 
enjoy the music, from Interupt, and all the tahnks in the world to John 
Cayley, who organized the wonderfuul event, -

by the way what i meant to say is that the sleeplessness that reults form 
the noise of jackhammering, badly st etal lates, and street sawing might 
actually be the cause of the stress that leads to this sort of typing 
nonsense, who says that noise pollution isn't on the increase to 
inconceivable levels - Apan




big iron plates


this description for an upcoming audio release but also goes along
w/ neighborhood noise, in particular:

http://www.alansondheim.org/plates1.mp3 big iron plates
http://www.alansondheim.org/plates2.mp3 big iron plates

so was contacted by a reporter from the NY Daily News re: my complaints 
(with others) concerning our deteriorating environment, no sleep, no
breathing, we'll see) - enjoy the plates

dominion of striations, vocalizations. spews, and vocalizations - and 
these can occur in any form, writing, tributes, determining vocalization, 
perfectly in the voice of azure, sub-vocalization or knot, perfectly in 
the voice of alan, sub-vocalization or knot.

vocalizations becomes paramount, i'd add the prerequisites of walking and 
talking, subvocalizations dominion of striations, vocalizations. spews, 
and vocalizations - and these can occur in any form, writing, dominion of 
striations, vocalizations, electronics, vocalizations/song as body 
indices, breath/rattling/string and skysphere removal and new spheres, new 
vocalizations, new grit, new organs impacted by the exertions of the 
movement, the vocalizations were laced with spews, and vocalizations - and 
these can occur in any form, listen -

Nets arena construction at Atlantic Yards causes sleepless nights in 
Prospect Heights 
All night jackhammering driving Dean St. residents crazy

The still under-construction Barclays Center, which will be home to the 
Brooklyn Nets NBA basketball team arena.

The Atlantic Yards project is causing a lot of sleepless nights for 
Prospect Heights neighbors.

All night jackhammering for utility work to prepare for the new Nets arena 
- expected to open in September- has residents on Dean St. near 5th Ave. 
ready to crack, they said.

And on the other side of the project site, the state last week authorized 
developer Bruce Ratner to work until 3 a.m. on rebuilding the Carlton Ave. 
Bridge, which he is scrambling to get done in time for the arena opening.

.It.s horrible,. said Gary Wiebke, 52, who lives on Dean St. .The noise 
levels are astounding. Our building shimmies, it shakes..

Residents said the work on the electrical upgrades goes on until 6 a.m. - 
and about an hour later, construction work on the arena starts. They say 
it.s the latest in a series of arena-related infrastructure projects that 
have driven them up the wall. Wiebke said a tenant who rented the 
apartment across the hall from him moved out after less than a week 
because he couldn.t take it.

.I'm getting physically ill as a result of not sleeping,. said Alan 
Sondheim, 69. .The noise really got seriously intolerable..

Con Ed spokesman Bob McGee said workers have been installing an electrical 
conduit to prepare for the arena, and have to work at night due to traffic 
concerns. He said they.ll have to do eight more days of work to pull and 
splice cables and haven.t determined whether it will be at night or during 
the day.

Over at the Vanderbilt Railyards, Ratner spokesman Joe Deplasco said the 
late-night work is .required to complete the rail yard work and north half 
of the bridge..

Wayne Bailey, 57, who lives across from the yard, said as bad as the noise 
are the blinding flood lights that make it bright enough to read a book at 
midnight. .It is so extreme, it.s so glaring, it.s such light pollution 
that kids can.t go to sleep,. he said.

The breakneck pace to finish the bridge in time for the arena opening 
comes after the bridge.s completion date was repeatedly pushed back.

.They got started late, and now they.re rushing,. said Peter Krashes of 
the Dean Street Block Association. .This is a circumstance they created 
for themselves. They shouldn.t be let off the hook..

The ongoing noise problems will be one of the issues on the table Tuesday 
when Ratner, the state, and Atlantic Yards opponents go to court to argue 
an appeal over whether the project should be required to get new approvals 
since it was revealed it may take up to 25 years to build, not 10 as 
originally claimed.

Cheating with Jogia Sarangi

http://www.alansondheim.org/raspless.mp3

The jogia sarangi is one of the most difficult instruments I've played. 
Aden Evans gave me his, and I found a dilruba bow which works with it. 
Unfortunately, it will take me quite a while to begin to make it sound 
beautiful (if I can at all). It has three main playing strings, but for 
some reason the bridge is flat, allowing fingering on only the two outer 
ones. The strings are stopped, not by pressing them down, but, as on the 
sarangi itself, by pressing the nails or the skin above the nails, against 
the side of the string. The three playing strings are gut; there are also 
seven drone strings. I find it incredibly difficult to tune; in any case, 
I made a recording, and then proceeded to use filtering to somewhat 
imitate the way the instrument should actually sound. It was interesting 
to me that after playing it, I went back and played violin and viola; they 
seemed simple in relation. I ran exuberantly up and down the necks! I 
sounded good. In any case, here's the jogia sarangi, somewhat modified: 
beware!



the night is shattered by the sound of jogia sarangi...
