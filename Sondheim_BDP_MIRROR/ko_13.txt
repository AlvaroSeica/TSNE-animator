Hokusai's Visit to Kyoto, 1828 (Bunsei 11)


Hokusai kicks higher into the air than safety would allow!
Hokusai heartily moves upward and downward on the same spot and fast!
Hokusai runs aimlessly around the MOO, Coyote on the loose!
I don't understand that.
Hokusai cries, half in sadness and mourning, half in pure exhaustion.
Hokusai laughs infectiously and everyone desires to join in!
I don't understand that.
Hokusai kisses everyone, remembering safe sex, and the kindness of
 strangers!
Hokusai walks around Kyoto looking at everyone through his eyes.
Kyoto
an intense clearing, city-basin, distant humans, everywhere visible...
You see snow, Luminous Sign, and the City of Wind here.
