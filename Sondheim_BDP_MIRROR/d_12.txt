My So-Called Life





i was already the empty tomb, the ransacked body

ribs cling to flesh, memories of skin held taut

filled with words: that made me a bone-bag bone-

bridge listen

there is a circle of teeth around me, brown plaster

into scarred black earth, black-white chipped

tongued dried skinned-palm-flat, outline: a horn

barks in the distance. now you are empty, only

see me age. text falls out, collapses, a dog wounded

struggles to rise against the dawn very of the world.

it can't. what won't be read, that last word, angela

born with computers, circuits, wolves and pens:

they leave trails forever. i have left. these words

flash flesh through the charnal-house there on 

cemetery left. they are swollen with misspellings,

forgotten links to language, dark forests, wet boughs

of errors, musk smell of death and dissolution. now

i am broken now past door. in the wet twig foundered

on the earth. in the twig-rot, slime mold gathered

together where the words spill, spoil, sprawl.

where the words spun webs. where the webs were spun.
