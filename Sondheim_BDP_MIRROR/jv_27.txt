Rhetoric


Friends, I ask you, if my life has been a total waste? Please do not reply
all at once; listen between the columns of the Forum. | | | | | | | | | |
I have explored the farthest reaches of cyberspatiality, moving fluently 
from talker to pbmmake, wandering through directories and forests |  |  |
all, to perhaps, no avail: For what is the value of a Sophist tied to the
K/not of the Virtual? What glows beyond these corporate realms, already 
drawn to unforeseen control? If I write of Ontology, am I marked, | | | | 
localized, a Fool in the Paradise of the Other moving swiftly into further
considerations of the Truth? Have I abandoned truth? Have I lost sight of
any other Real, favoring the virtue of the all-too-easy-solution in these
dimmed texts of reduced bandwidth, regular spacings, symmetries |   |   |
whole or broken? This surely is not the span of the philosophical, but an
arena blurred of gender, indeterminations, loss? To the extent I write in
this domain, I am lost, myself, full of misrecognitions of others |||||||
for whom there is no judgement from within. "Friends, I ask you, if my
life has been a total waste? Please do reply, and all at once."
