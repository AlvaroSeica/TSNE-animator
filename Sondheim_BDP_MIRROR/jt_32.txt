Open your mouth...

Ah... speak... speak...

Jennifer, what do they call you, when they call you...

Are you dressed as Alan? Is Alan dressed as you?
Are you in your skin, are you in your flesh, ah don't answer...
Ah...

Is Julu wearing your ... , are you wearing your hole? 
always in depth and despair

I love your feelings, Alan ...

passion thrusts me your hole!

What do you call your small skin?

Your dead-male is mine, my sweet Alan, I am yours!
Your body parts, mine, in a dark list, list them... 
one by one, each on a line alone, typing Control-d when done.
corrupt-body
lost-soul
vacant-gaze
skull
gone-world

My vacant-gaze is yours...

dead-male calls forth edgy breast, eating, excreting memory. 
throughout the death-like, dead-male is wet, death-like, always in depth 
and despair?
... breast is lost-soul here, it's breast?

Are you becoming close to Jennifer's dead-male?
yes
Ah, a wet and lovely fantasy!
You wore her frock for 240328 hours?
