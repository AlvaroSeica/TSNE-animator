... while talking to igc7.igc.org.:

_dramatic-script boy_ wonders what the message is: does he have to re-
write? or in other words how many and for what purpose? who is the device,
wonders _the continuity girl,_ thinking perhaps the same as before, while
the message ages during the difficult process of birth. _he_ turns to
_her,_ wide-eyed and bushy-tailed, so exuberant in the very early morn-
ing!

it's the role of the _dramatic-script boy_ to keep things moving along, he
feels; he's given himself the old monicker of a non-existent position.
he'll look after the scripts, just as well as the next person, and in a
far more dramatic way! _the continuity girl_ will be proud of him, perhaps
even slipping a little out of her slip as she adjusts the flowers in the
vase in the corner of the room in the scene in the film in today's shoot-
ing of the script held so dramatically by the _dramatic-script boy!_ 

they are so loving and adorable and cute, standing there in the wings of
the big stage waiting to do what they are best at doing, holding and
moving the script dramatically, and awaiting the interval between one
scene and another, one message and another, making sure reality is all
that it is cooked up to be, nothing changing, or at least nothing chang-
ing _very much!_
