wanting to move the panorama, and the fields of dawn and dusk,
into the realm of eternal night, where there are killings
gone underground or bomb-blast night in the dark distance,
shattered hard and splintered, against icons raging in the desktop sky -
there's knowledge in thickets, someone is hanging there -

for a moment humans shrink earths and worlds, planets and moons,
and for a second a single shaft of sunlight makes us beg - 
that a savior will come, or a plague or pure annihilation -

i compress the panorama, place it in my pocket, harden it -
it's a thing of memory, i'm hiding down there in the thickets -
you won't ever find me, there more than one body -
they're in the trees, swaying - they're on the side of the road,
they're a comfort to me, i lie among them -

in the distance, a voice - who is hanging there?
