millennial armageddon armored postmodern truth

i look towards the armageddon truth of my scribblings armed to the teeth
with postmodernism; how can I follow up syntax error "(2)*(3) 6 (2*3)*(a*-
b) 0 (2*3)**a (standard_c-esaer pytqkz er," a standard affair scrawled
against: scribbled, scrawl, scratched, scraped, scrapped: root-meanings of
nicked/corroded surfaces: as-if there were armature or order, figure or
articulation: my postmodernism-firepower-clandestine-technology shows such
error here: my postmodernism-dissemination-espionage-machine errors this
work and inconceivable followup: consider this a _tail_ to such as "as in
riemannian geometry - you can't tell the space from the connection or gri-
stle-tendon" - a tail _in other words_ entailing a continuation - a bridge 
or transition - a transitive invisibility or irigarayan feminine - as if 
this junction or juncture didn't exist - as if this was always already ab- 
sent, as if this were unaccounted, unaccountable, unaccounted-for - i look 
so much towards armageddon truth, near-earth asteroid on collision course 
approach: postmodernism saving nothing - postmodern-undercover-apparatus -
