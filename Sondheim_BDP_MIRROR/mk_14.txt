the glades are a continuous dynamic process across a planar surface. a
park with variable boundaries, problematic topography based on hydrology
and human intervention. the dynamic is everything; think of the glades as
an _inscribed surface_ transforming in space and time - a surface organic
and shifting. the glades are simultaneous with their entanglement of life
and migration; they are vectored, and vector is everything.

geology is underfoot; to manage the glades is to manage the ecosystem. 
invisible topographies / geologies manifest by surface organism. the 
indefinite prolonging of comprehension.

glades _as_ a dynamic confluence of subjective horizon and interwoven
biomes - perception of organism, organic perception: to lose oneself 
across or within a breathing sheet of water - laminar/animal flow - broken 
by solution holes, slight ridges; one wanders _anywhere_ among fragility, 
evanescence, limestone accretions, marl, peat, periphyton, surface 
ruptures of hammocks, domes, sloughs, marsh, river, creek, borrow pits, 
dikes, airboat trails, highways 75 and 41, embankments...
