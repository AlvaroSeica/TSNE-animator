I would love to lie with Julu, unfold
Her flap of skin from where it joins
This perineum, or Jennifer, unstitched
In that vast region between one nipple
And the other's vacancy and stare;
Still, somewhere bleak I recognize
These impulses as extra-current voices
Ceasing precisely at a certain temperature,
Beginning once again as world and room fall quiet
And my too comfortable bed holds all at once.
O Julu, I would cry, O Jennifer, and turning
Then from one unto the other, homeward-bound,
I'd once again be whole and hole identical,
The perfect rose within the perfect vase,
Or perfect home within a perfect vale.
But now, I wake, another scar appears
Across my bleak pleateaus of sheltered skins,
And it will take until my death reigns down
For such writing to complete, to cease - 
Then, and only then, will others come
And read my body, what I could not, across
The corpse of Alan, Julu, Jennifer.
I write myself for you, and you, I think;
I cannot read these letters that I write - 
They were not meant for me, what may contain
The vast appeal of great uncertain worlds,
Which I could be but vessel, channel, woman,
Of Julu, Jennifer, Alan, tribe of woman,
Not that a story would not have started forth
From half-dead lips, breath, pale exhalation;
The flap of skin, the surgery, is all
The fuel I have left, as well as memory
Of fuel, triad, scar, and conflagration.
