Jennifer


Jennifer sat up and stood down. She raised her frock and cut her panties a
slit. "Now I have a small slit," she said to her head. She bent over, and
shat a perfect shit, round long like green asparagus, green like long
round asparagus. It kept coming and coming. Where have you been, o vege-
table. "I will make you pile on the screen," said Jennifer (and panties).
Wipe wipe, she cleared a space, smeared apace, on the CRT. "Now it will be
me." Asparagus rows grew higher and higher, a small choir. They are my
lighthouse and my eyes, said Jennifer, sitting up and lying down. She
patted her frock lock. O wayward! Her feet bicycled the air. Her feet bi-
cycled tremendously! Whirr! "You are looking at my shit!" cried! Jennifer! 
Whirr! O! For to take a walk, now I will kill every dog.
