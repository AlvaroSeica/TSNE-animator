Spice Girls and Spline Girls


Abstract: The appeal of the Spice Girls lies in their equivalent on-stage
positions; young girls can identify with a dissemination of desire that is
not located in face-to-face alterity, but instead exists within a general-
ized field. The fairly explicit sexuality of the Spice Girls thereby es-
tablishes part-objects as models which can be played with, much as avatars
- entering and inhabiting bodies of real and virtual subjectivities - turn
towards the Spline Girls, spline "a flexible wood or rubber strip, e.g.
used in drawing large curves" (Oxford) - bending through forms which
become traces of subjectivity and a multiplicity of I's, eyes.
