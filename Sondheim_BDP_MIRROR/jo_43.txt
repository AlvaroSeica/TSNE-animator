[The story so far: Jennifer experiments with NNTP, desperate to find her
name listed on alt.fan.jen-coolest, the coolest newsgroup around. Jennifer
finds herself locked out of site after site, finally having to settle for
sad Panix attacks, where she reads her email in a small and almost
pathetic voice.]

Summary: Psychosis-texts, Internet Theory through "Jennifer"
Keywords: Avatar, Philosophy, Psychology, Cyberspace
X-Newsreader: TIN [UNIX 1.3 unoff BETA release 961018]

I have been working with Jennifer, writing/developing a continuous medita-
tion on cyberspace; you can find the texts (Jennifer Texts) at http://jef-
ferson.village.virginia.edu/~spoons/internet_txt.html .

Jennifer writes through a variety of styles; she is listed in the index at
the site. 

It's clear that Jennifer is not an "alter ego," or "avatar," or "gender-
bending," or "character" - but that the reality of virtual subjectivity is
incredibly complex, bordering on psychosis, on Freudian notions of hyster-
ia, and Butler's concepts of gender construction. 

You, Jennifer and others, may find the work of interest.
