prediction

this is a prediction and a truth of and towards the year 3000 in the year
3000 something will be a distant plant something will be a distant plant
and you will not know it nor the roots nor stems nor leaves nor flowers it
will be unimaginable it will be from and within wonder on an earth you
will not recognize in a non-being that is ultimata broken machines these
and other desperations dissolute in air of molecules and ruined atoms they
will not know then what has occurred unknowledge transpires and is every-
where there is a non-mattering of unknowledge that will be the same and
substance ruling or ruined same and ruling substance of the day or forlorn
day of gone time or world forlorn unknowledge towards a glimmer or horizon
towards transpiration and non-mattering this is a prediction and a truth
of and from the year 3000
