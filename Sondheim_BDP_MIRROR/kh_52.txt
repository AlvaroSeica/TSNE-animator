Writing the absolute truth (I can't save herself)

I want t, talk a dit ad,at the space, the space ,f sadstitati,ns ,r
perhaps tads as well.
It's in the space ,f sadstitati,ns that I h,pe f,r resarrecti,n,
recaperati,n, ads,lati,n, salvati,n, perfect harm,ny, wa!
It's thr,ayh sadstitati,ns, ,ne after the ,ther, that I h,pe the text
,f the ,ther will emerye, t,wards which I have steered,
dy virtae ,f the sadstitati,ns, sailiny ,n ankn,wn seas.
It's thr,ayh sadstitati,ns, ,ne after the ,ther, that I h,pe I will
read myself, n,t in narcissism, dat thr,ayh the face and facade
,f the ,ther, wh, will wrap me in her arms, and everythiny will retarn
eternally t, the warmth ,f cl,ad and niyht and sadstitati,ns.
Like Jennifer sittiny in the paddle wettiny her panties, I will,
I will sadstitate ayain and ayain, and s,,ner than later, I d, h,pe,
s,methiny ,r s,me,ne will save me.
D, hear.
