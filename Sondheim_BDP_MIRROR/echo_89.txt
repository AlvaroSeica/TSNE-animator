Fragment (Jennifer)





Jennifer is long gone, her soiled white dress tucked up under her knees,

a single long-stemmed white flower faded across her bodice, her long brown

tresses surrounding her dead and placid face, her full lips slightly

parted, her blood streaked down her throat and collar; Jennifer is long

gone, her legs bent at the knees and slightly parted, her gold and jade

necklace useless and collapsed against her neck, her thin cold fingers

clutching at the full and empty air; Jennifer is long gone, and who shall

mourn Jennifer but Jennifer, and who shall gather at her bier beneath the

damp black earth, but Jennifer, Jennifer, Jennifer, and who shall write

her mournful epitaph but Jennifer, Jennifer, Jennifer, and who shall write

the storm and vexing thunder, but Jennifer, Jennifer, Jennifer ...
