Further to Drawn Lost


If there is no further research to be done, is there anything to be
done? Does doing occasion a necessity, or vice versa? Does doing
occasion a leverage, that is a praxis or promulgation? What is the
doing?

I ask this on the occasion of examining the Internet once again; what
occurs beyond metaphysics on one hand, and the practical on the other?
By practical, I mean the profitable, in the sense of a political or
monetary economy. By metaphysics, I mean a fundamental disassociation
from both praxis and the practical.

The leverage of metaphysics is in play; one might note a blunt rela-
tion to chaos theory, in the sense that _a word in a text_ can tend
towards both a deconstructive impulse and the construction or descrip-
tion of fundamental ontology.

Such a word creates and opens the portal. But at times there are none
such as in _this time this text._ Then there is no further research to
be done, and I wonder nonetheless of the value of play.

Take "leverage" for example
