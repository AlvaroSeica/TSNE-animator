Poem by Nikuko


I want this poem to be cleansed of all reference
to bombings, aerial or otherwise, missiles of crews,
land or sea or air; we've only recently taken notice
of the violence against us, turned like cowards
to write of war and anger, mutilation and despair:
Now clean this poem, I order you: Get out with all
your wars.
