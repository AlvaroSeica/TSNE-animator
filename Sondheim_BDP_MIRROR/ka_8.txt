For Le. Parergon


If there is noise, nothing can be done about it.
Noise can be contained within a frame.
Noise can be framed, but there is nothing to be done about it.
Think of blackbody radiation as a kind of noise.
If there is chaos, there are strings attached.
Think about the strings attached and where they are going and where they
have come from.
Think about how noisy chaos is.
If there is anomaly, think about the bright new frame.
Think of how the frame is the anomaly, or the anomaly is the frame.
Think how the bright new frame is shiny like a fetish.
If there is a disturbance, think about the noise of other things.
Think of other things becoming chaotic, with tarnished frames and strings.
Think of how the strings are broken, and everything becomes noise.
Think of how noise becomes clutter and how things fall apart.
If there is anomaly, everything can be done about it.
If there is noise and there is no frame, nothing can be done, there is
nothing to be done, and nothing to do it.
If there is anomaly and there is no frame, everything jumps what later on
becomes precisely one level.
If there is chaos and there is no frame, it might as well be noise.
If there are no ideas but in things, there are no things but in ideas.
If there are things, there are frames.
