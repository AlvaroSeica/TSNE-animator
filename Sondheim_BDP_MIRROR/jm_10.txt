Sign/als


Balls rise and fall, cones face up or down; pure light radiates at inter-
vals from sources. Lighthouse signifies identity, presence itself radiat-
ed; it maps virtual modalities, waves of sound and light, in extension of
danger and submergence. 

Sources flood; radio beacons function through interpreters. Less precise
and reliable, they soothe and integrate, their signal broken by static.
The compass itself declines its proper function, graciously deflecting in
honor of local anomalies.

Weather forecastings are otherwise than being; these trace through the
signifier alone, superstructural guidance through double coding, inter-
preters and listeners, radios and linguistic unraveling/competency. The
symbolic as radical disconnect leaves no trace; ikonic lighthouse leaves
trace only within the chaotic domain.

O Mariner, look no farther than thine eyes allow, hear naught but what
confirms by amplitude of sound or visual warning. Virtual weathers de-
ceive, nothing is certain in the northern climes.


For these reasons, O Mariner, we have inscriptions and markings, bound-
aries and demarcations, transmissions and tokens, overlaying sea, land,
and atmosphere with guidance - all to be swept away by yon storm upon the
horizon, whiteout in violent winter, scudding clouds bringing sea to bear
upon barren deck, swept clean of eye and ear, compass and radio, signi-
fiers all.
