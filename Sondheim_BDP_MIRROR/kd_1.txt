The Thesis of the Recent Work


My thesis is, that all cultures are illegible.
There is always already a problematic of reading, writing, trans-
mission.
In one's native culture, these appear transparent, as if the habitus
were capable of denotation - as if the signifier exhausted the world.
After one has misunderstood, one consigns the rest to silence.
What cannot be expressed in a particular language, may not be expres-
sible in any.
Thought, cultural thought, thinking through or within a culture, does
not necessarily proceed by signs dependent on the culture.
Within the literate frame of mind, the world appears as if there were
signifiers all the way down.
If one omits illegibility, one begins with understanding, subject to
misrecognition.
What is illegible, the cultural _scrawl._
The scrawl is a recognition that cultural attributes, parameters,
languages, instantiations, may be heuristic, ad hoc, appearances only
as if there were cultural laws, superstructures, placements and
consensual citations.
I use Japan as an instance of (my) misrecognition. I _apply_ this
misrecognition elsewhere, to my native culture(s), to theory itself,
to my ability to _read, write, and transmit._
This is a thesis as _therapeutic_; make no mistake about it.
Or rather: continue to make mistakes: that is my thesis.
_All cultures are illegible._
