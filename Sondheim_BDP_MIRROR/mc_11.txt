     2	we're just here at whatever age,
     3	we sense the terror everywhere,
     4	but the earth will survive
      	
     5	incandescent heat and plasma
     6	steps us through anything into void,
     7	this letter 'i' doesn't see the terror,
     8	nothing ever will
      	
     9	you've got to drink and fuck all night long
    10	and look into each other's eyes and scream,
    11	you've got to carry on, there's not long,
    12	in the new story, it's the same old story
      	
    13	the terror's in the very way we walk 
    14	but we claw naked down the hall in hell, 
    15	return to heaven, fuck hard and raw, 
    16	drink our fill again, then crawl and scream
      	
    17	the candle burns, rains fall, the sun eclipse,
    18	the day grows dark, heaves light, we're drinking hard,
    19	and drunk we know it's just the same old story,
    20	until death parts us, even now we don't know when
