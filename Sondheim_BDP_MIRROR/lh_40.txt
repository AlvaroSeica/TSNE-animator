Nikuko sang the song of the north.

This was in Nara.

Again in Kirishima,
Nikuko sang the song of the north.
Then she sang the song of the west.
Then she sang the song of the west.
Then she sang the song of the west.

Izanagi said to her, Something is missing here. Nikuko replied, Nothing
is missing, either I am the east or nothing is the east, either I am the
south or nothing is the south. Izanagi said, Nikuko, you'd better stop
singing, if you eat up all the songs, there will be nowhere to go, and
everyone will be in your way. From that moment on, Nikuko sang all four
songs over and over again until there were many norths, many souths, many
wests, and many easts (i.e. each to her own). Later she said, now everyone
is lost and no one will find their way back. Izanagi replied, You have
just created death, Nikuko. They continued on their journey (i.e. no one
knows their destination).
