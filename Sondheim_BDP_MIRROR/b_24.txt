Homely





[echo $HOME]

When you need to go home and are all alone

Who are you to listen to?

Life becomes unstuck and glue

Won't cut it, take it to the bone.

But echo $HOME, and all turns towards the thing

That roots itself, and yet will give you wing.



[cd ..]

(To turn away, seedy; the dots that follow

Withdraw your presence into something hollow.)



But I'm tired and I want to return. Tired of reading and writing, tired 

of subbing and unsubbing, tired of administrating and tired of life, worn 

out, another birthday an hour away, and all I can think, where are we going.



I think: It might be good to attack, subvert, take over other lists.

I think: We need a fortified Web Site with carnivorous maverick links 

devouring all the others.

I think: Check out the Computer Underground Digest *now* as the Net turns 

towards corporate power.



Let's all write about things we don't believe in and send them out 

everywhere on the Net. Let's become unwanted holy angels bringing nothing 

but bad addresses to bad people.



Let's get them.



But I'm tired and want to go home. I echo myself (yawn, already trite), 

Narcissus in electric pond. I can't even see my fucking self; there's no 

Mosaic in ancient Greece, no Netscape. .jpeg downloading worked flat and 

out flat-out in Plato's terminal.



So I'm tired and go cd like Paula said. I go seedy, jump from the window. 

Lame, I'll beg in subways. You'll hear me asking for net.money net.sex, 

you'll know I'm a whore.



Let's get them. I'm out there with Clara Hielo Internet. I'm not alone.
