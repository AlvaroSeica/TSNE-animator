When nighttime falls, I crawl the walls,
Miss all that I hold dear;
I drop a tear, my crying stalls,
Because I walk the sphere.
I walk the left, I walk the right;
I walk both far and near.
I am bereft, an ugly sight,
Because I walk the sphere.
The sphere is big, it has no eyes,
It has no ears to hear my cries;
It is a nightmare in disguise -
I walk it in great fear.
I never know where I have been
In spite of mourning and of sin,
Because I walk the sphere.
