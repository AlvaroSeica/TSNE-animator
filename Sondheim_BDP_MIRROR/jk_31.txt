The discussion between Jerry Everard and I leads to the following:

Is drawing a distinction an instance of the application of an a priori?
In other words, is _distinction_ primitive? I think so. You may _not._
_Drawing a distinction_ is an act of course. Is an act a primitive?
Does every act draw a distinction?

These questions, while idle, aren't idle.
