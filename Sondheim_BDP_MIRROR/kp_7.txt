whatever you want of me in whatever form you want
because i write something called "theory" and it is you
whom i call to be my object taking my words
into her description and giving my words
into her explanation, against which  any slight thing
will bring me to my knees or other position
and as long as i can type or hold a pen or memorize
your figures i will be found against my mind
or place of writing, that is sondheim@panix.com
or 432 dean street in brooklyn new york, or other
numbers or others, whatever you want of me when i have
knowledge and a way to hold it uncorrupted and dear
or corrupted for your pleasure, as theory starts
and turns and shuffles forward in the night
doing that long slow dance, that theory theory dance
