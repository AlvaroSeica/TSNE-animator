The Monologs


<Julu> As long as Nikuko remains the beautiful Russian ballet dancer,
she'll pull it in.
<Julu> Only the universe will feel it.
<Julu> It will be identical to itself.
<Julu> The universe will be winding and winding as Nikuko pirouettes.
<Julu> We will wait forever and a day, it is all the same to us.
<Julu> Nothing at all.
<Julu> No thanks.
<Julu> I'll say amen to all of us.
<Jennifer> My teeth take your tricks, turn them inside-out.
<Jennifer> I wake up in the middle of the night and *sob* and I think.
<Jennifer> It's hard to concentrate.
<Jennifer> *sob*
<Jennifer> She's wrapping the whole universe around her.
<Jennifer> She'll pull it in like a woven garment.
<Jennifer> The universe will feel nothing.
<Jennifer> And yet...
<Jennifer> *sob* nothing to do with it.
<Alan> I do want to thank you for this display of wonder.
<Alan> In the morning, after stars are stretched to the limit.
<Alan> The universe nestled among the folds of organdie.
<Alan> *sob*
