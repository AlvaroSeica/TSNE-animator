Read Meat


Let us call her Jennifer, who operated in my mouth, discovering two con-
nected large abscesses and a third smaller, both in the upper jaw. Let us
describe the miraculous lasers and their operations, white-green light,
red-orange light, blue-white light. Then we are ready for the splitting of
meat and psyche: for as Jennifer applied herself to the fiber-optic carry-
ing, not packets, but energy for cutting and cauterizing, the mouth-meat
is seared, cooked, and smoked; and let us call Alan, this patient under-
going such treatment, wearing dim heavy and green protective goggles. Then
notice with Alan (now on codeine, novacaine, ibuprofen, antibiotics), the
smoke and odor emanating (as Jennifer has emanated) from his mouth, pre-
cisely, as he explains to Jennifer, of the scent of succulent and well-
cooked roast beef. And while Alan rarely engages in red-meat (more like I
am read meat, says Jennifer, aroused now by all this talk), this scent,
from his own flesh and blood (as I would be, says Jennifer) leads to a
certain hunger on Alan's part; he finds himself dreaming of a beautiful
meal of roast beef, garnered from his own flesh, perhaps (if not from
Jennifer's, she muses). Self-cannibalism, a form of the auto-chthonic, and
I am ready for her devouring. Like Ouroboros, metaphysics eats its _tale._
