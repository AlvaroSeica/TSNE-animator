I'm Digressing a course for Underacademy College - here's the description:

EDIBLE AVATARS, ANOREXIA, AND FALSE ACCUSATION: THE THEORETICAL BASES OF 
HOLOGRAPHIC FUTURES AND MELANCHOLIA

Edible avatars succumb to anorexia; prims have little or no body of 
course, although avatars might be accused of just about anything, 
including. Holographic objects have no weight and that makes them sad; if 
you're a tree in a forest you can't hear an avatar crying in any case.

Digressor: Alan Sondheim

We've been discussing the topic - mainly dealing with avatars and 
apparitions, anorexia, pain, The Visible Human Project, and other related 
issues. The blog is at http://anorecticavatar.blogspot.com/ and open for 
comments from anyone.

I'm really happy at the level and direction of the discussion; I'm 
learning a lot from everyone. Please give a read!

Thanks, Alan, Digressor

when things turn out death gets hir chance to sing

death is a woman following me
death is a tall man in a black fedora
death follows me and sings hir mournful tune
death owes me nothing and gives me nothing
i scream at death you owe me a piece of wood
you owe me a nineteenth-century piece of wood to make a flageolet
death pays no attention and hides the piece of wood
the wood is a cylinder designed for breathing and singing
the wood cries out, i am useless, death has me in hir grasp
i beg you i say to death release my piece of wood
anything you say to death, death has heard a million times over
in every language and cry, death has not listened
i will record my language and cry to death and here it is
here it is death, you can take it or leave it

extended meditation with extended denouement

http://www.alansondheim.org/labor.mp3 sarangi

please listen with earphone with as much fidelity
as possible, you will be rewarded.

the sarangi used was the antique one, which i now
am fairly certain is a modified sindhi sarangi
with the two metal melodic/drone strings replaced 
by a traditional sarangi gut string. reverb was
added with adobe audition; the sarangi creates its
own cosmos or resonant space. labor of course is
fundamental to this music, which is exhausting to
play. as musicians we are never paid enough, not 
for our sound, not for our gift of meditation to
you, and not for our architecture. here is then
the promised gift; the musician fades away and may
not have sufficient means to survive for any
reasonable length of time, however defined. the
sarangi, too, needs tending; the pressure on the
bridge and pull of the strings is tremendous.
enjoy.


Three Improvisations

http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/greatoud1.mp3 oud for me and you
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/greatoud2.mp3 oud for Myk Friedman
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/greatcobza.mp3 cobza for everyone

there are p.m., post meridean, early afternoon improvisations
greatoud1 transforms 1/3 of the way through
greatcobza is as difficult as cobzas are wont to be
greatoud2 meanders glissandi until you're immersed in meandering
 glissandi

the oud's the Shehata oud and the cobza's the rare 10-stringed one
 enjoy. please. enjoy.



Sondheim's "Music"

He's always showing off.
He's a total fake and doesn't know it.
He's fraud and really doesn't care.
His music has no depth at all.
His music is just a lot of runs.
He repeats the same chords over and over again.
He's melodic ideas are moronic.
When he can't escape he throws tricks in.
He seems to be in love with the minor scale.
His minor scale is always the same minor scale.
He shouldn't be surprised his audience is tiny.
He shouldn't be surprised no one buys his stuff.
He's too embarrassed to look at the audience.
He's always too nervous to play well.
He's always dissonant but he can't hear it.
He can't tell one scale from another.
He thinks he can master just about anything.
His intonation is atrocious.
He can't play at all in tune without frets.
He should put his flute away or sell it.
His repairs are a joke.
He'd be lucky if his instrument's in tune.
He has no sense of dynamics except loud.
He accompanies other musicians like he's deaf.
Someone should take his instruments away.
He huffs and puffs like he's actually working.
He can't really play with any sense of rhythm.

He's ridiculous for thinking he's important.
He's always thinking he's breaking new ground.
He knows nothing about music.
He doesn't listen to anything except himself.
He's the most arrogant musician I ever heard.
He won't let anyone else touch his instruments.
When he can't play something he just gets rid of it.
He spams Facebook and email lists with his garbage.
He thinks playing fast makes his music better.
He can't read music and doesn't think it matters.
He doesn't know when a peg slips and he's playing.
He gets this pseudo-deep expression when he plays.
He's always trying to play with his eyes closed.
Other musicians run from him.
He's the most desperate musician I know.
He gives music a bad name. 
He gives musicians a bad name.
He's a control freak and tries to run everything.
He's lucky if he has an audience of ten.
No one wants to listen to him.
The sooner his stuff is forgotten the better.



the gods have spoken

http://www.alansondheim.org/balalu.mp3

the rest is up to us.
but the gods have spoken.
i don't understand what they're saying.
just as soon as they begin to get somewhere near the universal
frequency, they leave the scene - we alone once again, mumbling
sounds and hoping for the existence of gluons like fireflies on
stretched strings.
just as soon as humming and buzzing confusion straightens out,
somewhere, something, someone, comes along and tries to pin it
down and this is called culture that operates locally.
my culture which is left up to us operates globally.
the gods told me they're a real mess thanks to us.

If I die tomorrow

will there be much horror
if I die tomorrow

If I die today
will there be much play
will anybody pray
if I die today

If I have died before
I will wait at Heaven's door
I will wait and more
if I have died before

If I have died at all
I will wait upon your call
I will not rise or fall
if I have died at all

I will wait upon your call
if I have died at all

Kalakotkas, Osprey


Foofwa sent us the following link:

http://pontu.eenet.ee/player/kalakotkas.html

- A beautiful osprey nest on the border of Estonia and Latvia
- There were many birds in the background
- I thought I would play sarangi with the birds
- Well aware was I that the birds could never hear me
- Nonetheless I persevered in my accompaniment
- In Osprey1, I am working more with imitation
- But in Osprey2, I have composed a little tune as well
- Many times I have played with and for birds
- Many times they have answered me and we play together
- This time, I was at the mercy of the birds
- They would never hear whatever I played
- But I wasn't play for myself, I was playing for you as well
- And so I wanted to honor Estonia and Latvia, and you
- And above all, I wanted to honor the kalakotkas, the osprey
- I did not want to make a mistake!
- I wanted everything to be as perfect as possible!
- I wanted to touch nature through artificial technology
- I wanted here, the slightest hint of nature as well
- And of wilderness and of wild places I would never see
- Wild places I would honor with my playing
- Here are the two singings of the sarangi

http://www.alansondheim.org/osprey1.mp3 
http://www.alansondheim.org/osprey2.mp3

- And again, here is the living bird in her nest

Fifth Avenue, Dean Street, Urbanic

i play sarangi and bow

http://www.alansondheim.org/urbanic.mp3 

i awake from troubled sleep my body in incredible pain
the doctors can't find anything wrong
i've got kirba afaa xonso on the boombox
it's pouring outside and i can't see because of pain
i can't hear because of pain i can't feel anything
if you know me you know my pain which swells and crashes
quick it's time to pull out sarangi against the rain
there's noise on the streets, trucks and construction everywhere
when i sleep i hear jackhammering everywhere and wake all nervous
time i say for sarangi but it's so hard to play i say time for it
i do my best but what can one person do against an entire city
if bombs weren't illegal bombs would be everywhere
i drag myself and my instrument and begin to play
kirba afaa xonso in my mind stays in my mind
i will play music bombs and gunfire to death and then feel nothing
the bow goes bip bip the bow goes back and forth like rockets
the noise in the streets gets louder they are trying to drown me out
i am furious with them in this terrible pain and move to second octave
i am furious and move into third and begin to gain traction
my sarangi treads do not slip and my fingers ring strong and true
my fingers drive furrows deep into wood and my hands cut down bodies
i listen to kirba afaa xonso on the radio machine and the machine
i silence kirba afaa xonso and begin to play i am against the world
quick it's time all i have is bow and sarangi all i have is sound
they do not take sound from me they add sound to me
they add sound everywhere in my illness and my illness
look just there they have added sound i play sarangi and bow
i play sarangi and bow i play sarangi and bow


analog

http://www.alansondheim.org/152.mp3

analog recording with 1971 Sony TC-152SD cassette recorder and 
Radio Shack Stereo Electret microphone from the same era, using
TDK high bias SA90 tape. this is fed through Audacity into a
.wav file fed into Audition where normalization and studio reverb
are added and outputted as .mp3. the reason for all of this is
analog's ability to handle high-onset/format sound, resulting in
greater fidelity to the overall envelope of the instrument, even
though the high end cuts out around 15hz. I've been fascinated 
by the results: this is what I 'hear' in the room or directly
through headphones. the tape is edited to bring out oud, sarangi, 
pipa, and cura cumbus. the sarangi could have been better; I've
been bleary. I've been working with harmonics and 'grating' the
bow. oud, pipa, and cura cumbus are fine. 


trudy

sometimes you just make error after error until
you're fascinated by them and thee occur in the 
registers of timbre and approach to the instrument
itself. you're locked in there and produce the
first half of trudy. sometimes you just play 
slowly and the timbre comes, bringing with it the
potential for release, but you're remaining
guarded and can do little with it, and this 
produces the second half of trudy. sometimes you
have a premonition in the first half and a memory
in the second and that seems interesting to you
and you hold onto them as they bring life farther
into consciousness, holding the bad things at bay.
here is that consciousness and here is something
interesting, in 'trudy.'

last of the good-time boys for Tyler Stallings

http://www.alansondheim.org/lonesome.mp3

the good-time boys hear that lonesome whistle blow
the good-time bows have their ears to the track
they have their ears to the telegraph
anywhere there's steel, you'll find the good-time boys
anywhere there's noise, you'll find them breathing
