To Poetics list, I wrote of broken symmetry, in the midst of a discussion
of Zukovsky's A, _A_, "_A_", "A", which mirrored itself in every post;
there is a necessity for good postmodern punctuation, "for example,_ or
even _as a matter of fact." The length of the phrase gives status to the
twist engendered, cross-over between, say _italic* and *bold,_ but not
granting too literal "this or any other_ point. I would in fact add the
presence of the "_shunt or _"circumscription, backchannel"_ _as well,"
holding the comma to its prescribed task of _breathing through the line.*

In a fashion similar to _"the breaking of the nose, occurring over three
decades ago, *effacing" what remained, punctuation normally considered
_askew" pushes the symbolic into the *real,_ with the predictable result
of discomfiture, defuge, _the gathering of spines._ An occurrence of sym-
metry,_" then, seems overly cautious, the _insertion of the shifter" in or
within hegemonic space: *_a lie," in other words. *It lies in these or
other words.*

The universal broken symmetry of the K meson rises to the foregrounding of
the preference of mating organisms for "_pure pattern; this is the remnant
of that "_object a, lure or masquerade, from which there is no "re-turn-
ing._
