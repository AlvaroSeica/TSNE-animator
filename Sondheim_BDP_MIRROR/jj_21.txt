dusts

Core-theory is both intrinsic and extrinsic in its couplings; finance is
pervasive, agency of dissolution, worn and wearing down. Finance cancels
time and history, fissures populations; core-theory inscribes populations
and time. As dust dissipates the effects of radiation, finance cauterizes
the investigation of core-theory (Brillouin) which is coupled with energy.
As core-theory dusts and dissolves the entities of the world (Jeans and
Hiroshima), finance introjects and projects radiation. Radiation trans-
forms into media under the guise of capital; dust transforms into a re-
cuperated time under the guise of the scanning electron microscope. Dust
and finance embrace chaos and self-similarity; radiation and core-theory
reproduce the leniency of bandwidth.

The chiasm is the positioning of the abstracted alienation of the subject
who appears within other masquerades; this is the construct of the post-
modern.
