Thus - to a future editor:

I am writing as quickly as possible before I die. For example, the concept 
of 'alias' I employ here might well lead to a phenomenology of the imag- 
inary. But who has time to complete this? Furthermore, my work is full of 
misspellings, errors of grammar, confusions and awkwardness of style. I 
hope these will be corrected. I am blind to them. Even with copy-editing, 
I am blind to them. But they are present as the real is present, and as 
such, are erroneous; they conjure only what the alias permits. The sememe 
is catastrophically shattered in such, and most likely in all, instances. 
So the act of correction must be an active one - not merely copy-editing, 
but editing for content, deep-editing, correcting faults, and restoring 
the texts to their (non-existent and accurate) originals.

There is something deep here, more than meets the I ...
