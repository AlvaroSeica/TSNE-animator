joy joy joy
in every girl and boy
listen to the bells
singing radios
listen to the birds
singing merry words
playing lovely songs
in many lovely tongues
and talking radios
listen to the trees
saying what they please
whirl whirl whirl
and every boy and girl
turns in true delight
sings both day and night
and god will hear the tune
above the sun and moon
and god will come to us
and god will make amends
and fill a world of joy
in every girl and boy
and play the radio
and dance above the birds
and listen to their words
and whirl whirl whirl
fills every boy and girl
and joy joy joy
fills every girl and boy
