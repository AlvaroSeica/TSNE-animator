Parable


Izanagi and Nikuko came upon a corpse lying by the side of the road. They
were on the way back from Kagoshima; it was the middle of the night, but
the moon illuminated the landscape. Look, said Izanagi, something is
moving. Sure enough, a thin shadow flitted across the body, which was that
of a young samurai. He is not yet reborn, said Nikuko, and is moving
quickly through rebirth after rebirth; he continues to commit seppuku,
waiting for the proper body. He is bound to the wheel, Izanagi replied;
see how the body freshens every so often, as he almost returns to this
life. With that, Izanagi took his sword and severed the head with one
blow. He'll have to go somewhere else now, said Izanagi, turning around,
but Nikuko was nowhere to be seen.
