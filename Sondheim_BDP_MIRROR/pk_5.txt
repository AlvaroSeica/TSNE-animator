Recent work is related to human modeling, analog/digital distinction,
ontological/epistemological issues.

Older recent work:

"Recent work has been building on hardware software wetware outware
issues, especially the phenomenology of the virtual, motion capture, the
current political state of the nation; I have been moving into new realms
of representation in which body and substructure are mutually
problematized. I am also working on extending some theoretical work
dealing with cybernetics and (non) aristotelian logics."
