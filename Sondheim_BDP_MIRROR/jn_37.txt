Losers


For a lot of us, coming on-line is the sign of defeat, that real-life,
physical-life, material-life, pratico-material-life, has failed us; we
translate that into our own failure, immobility, handicap. So for many 
of us, on-line is already a tragedy foregrounded as community, good
friends, neighborhood bar - but a tragedy in which fate remains behind
whatever scene we choose to construct. 

There is always a bifurcation, decision to be made: turning on the com-
puter, signing in, entering a password into pathos. This is the inherent
sadness of this space, for those of us not here purely for research or
recreation. Every moment huddled over the keyboard is another moment in
shadow, out of sunlight, comradeship, loving partnership, engagement to
the fullest in the social.

Thus many of us are shadowed here by those who have denied us, turned us
down, rejected us, for often very good reasons. And in the gloom, many of
us spy beautiful and healthy bodies and minds, just beyond our reach, or
perhaps in the far distance - in any case, turning us inward once again,
towards our distorted mirrors.
