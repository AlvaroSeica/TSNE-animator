the debris field swirls around ground zero
the debris field swirls around ground zero

the debris field says
the debris field says

i am your names and your airplanes
i am your children 

of rock and metal i was born
the world returns to me
the world returns to me

i am all airplanes and all children
all airplanes and all children come to me

i am all names and all metals
of rock and metal and of flesh and bone
of rock and metal and of flesh and bone
the world returns to me 
the world returns to me

the debris field swirls around ground zero
singing its lonely song
singing its lonely song
