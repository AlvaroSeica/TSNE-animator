Zero, Flooded


Ms. Keyboard writes the texts, and Mr. Cloud fogs the screen. Mr. Clear 
cleans it up, and Ms. Keyboard writes the texts again. 

When I am on IRC, I am in an enormous funnel; query /msg comes across as 
lateral extension across the lips. When I am on MOO, I'm in a basin, lips 
turned up on the horizon.

Zero plus zero times zero times as many times zero, a comfort to compre- 
hend this expanding and collapsing structure. As in Whitehead, these are 
processes, operations; dividing by annihilation produces the world.

Ms. Keyboard sings the songs, and Mr. Throat mouths them. Mr. Song is 
sung. 

The womb fills with text; page appears as thin thread, mucous, across the
lips. When I'm on IRC, the hypnotic of the words body-arched mimics that
of feed-forward talker talk pouring down the throat. 

On ytalk it's like this, see? Ms. Ytalk cuts the screen, seeps in below. 
Mr. Me scribbles but it's really Mr. Cloud. Mr. Clear visits Ms. Keyboard 
on IRC. Zero times Mr. Song slides into Mr. MOO's funnel. And Mr. MOO is 
Mr. MOO.
