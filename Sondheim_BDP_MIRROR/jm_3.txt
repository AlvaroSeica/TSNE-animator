How are things done?

In order to do things, there must be a thought and a concept.
There must be leverage as well, hands to grasp and serrated edges
There must be material ready at hand.
One must have a concept of a goal and a future.
There should be a weaning from possession.
Jennifer needs a domain in order to accomplish things.
Things are never done, but are a short-hand for the doing.
Shoosh shoosh with a wave of the hand and a place to walk.
Everything can be used such as the biting of teeth and nails.
In order to do things, there must be a sense of being done.
A sudden burst of energy is all that is necessary to begin.
Beginning and ending and doing are just things that happen.
Language must silence itself, at least for the briefest moment.
Orderly promotions of tiny movements tend towards completion.
Movement are organized and may be thought away, like walking.
Jennifer needs a bit of energy like milkshakes or simple booze.
Sleepiness is not conducive as the body walls in with bark and leaves.
Momentum comes from a desire which informs and curls down to biomolecules.
O lazybones, get up, deconstruction obfuscates, circumambulates.
Laying out on the workbench is already a thinking and a doing.
Bursts of energy, lazybones, collapse into a pile of fatty acids.
Doing is all my beautiful domains, defuge withdraws and decathects.
Knotted cords anxiously tighten goals and scripts which are higher-level
processes already gone with the doing.
Anxiety and dreaming, thinking and nervous tightening, are all doings of
things as well.
Potential barriers and boundary maintenances are doings that are necessary
for the doings of things.
Jennifer underlines.
