Jennifer's Sonnet of Marbles and Brambles

Brambles have marbles by their bases, glass against knobby 
bark up towards dark green shoots, lovely white fleshy soles.
They're in cahoots, marbles' burbled presence by Jennifer's toes. 
One among each and each, each other. Jennifer's in throes
Of pain and anguish, delirious happenings. The sap drains 
from Jennifer's waist down to the ground hoisted by the naval beach.
We're not going to the beach, to the ocean or the grotty sea. There are
no waves. Jennifer shaves her body, slides marble packets in and out.
They make rackets, Jennifer shouts with joy, delight, dissolution. 
Proliferation of cornucopia of confusion, white wire tangling profusion,
the marbles are covered with dirt, whole villages of paramecia, stentor,
amoeba, nematodia clad and pillaged by Jennifer's souls.
We're not going anywhere, Jennifer-in-the-brambles monuments herself in
dark white beautiful marble plinth, she's in't.
