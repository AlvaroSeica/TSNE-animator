Unwitting


Unwitting: Decerebration of wit. A mouth came and ate my skull out.
Teeth grated against the bone interior. Teeth ploughed the cerebellum.
Gnawings at the junction between the hemispheres sliced, unfolded.
Perfect warriors in these seeded times. Roses and Argonauts.

Bulge of cranial effluvia in the throat. Swallowed hole of memory.
Gapes in the stomach, first one of us, then like a plague.
Devouring the rest, avatars and their swords-with-permissions.
Us them them / I other other / Eye   and the other    Eye/ .

Unwitting the brain: In front of you _I have nothing clever to say._
My tongue cleaves to my mouth, foreign teeth plough its tissue.
Furrows, agricultural lineages. Death trips over the seeding.
First, mine, then yours, the world. Skulls rocked emptied, furrowed.
What new plant slouches against the bone, rocking towards Jerusalem.

What no root.

Us them them.
