			All dancing is diirty.

( bodies sweat, contact, anorexia sets in, a dancer just died here today,
the body wants from nothing )

I think of the dance as a whirl without consent, like the body burning, on
fire, like frozen in hysteria: and then I think I do that and my heart
bursts open, and blood everywhere, this burst heart! And then I no longer
	   think, my whirling body-heart, body-burst-heart!

( like a singer without a song, totally open to the world, no computer, no
prosthetics, glasses, tampax, nothing encumbering, the dance opens up as
if there were no need, as if there were heavenly bodies, as if there were
floats and floatations, as if suspensions )

    I think of an inverted hysteria, the world as symptom of this
 burst-heart-body, world roiling and heaving system fast rotation and
				wobble

( the world's subsumed within the dance, it's a symptom, it's there as an
extension or an afterthought - the world is the afterthought of the dance
- it wobbles on varying pivots, it gyroscopes in varying axes, it twists
and turns, it turns away the face, the face of the world is the dance )

I think the hands hold old-fashioned canes and crushes these could be
		  quite dangerous wobble turn around

( I think you leave holding hands )
