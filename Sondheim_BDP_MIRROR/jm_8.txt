BAY OF FUNDY, SOUTH OF GRAND MANAN ISLAND, LOCAL MAGNETIC DISTURBANCE

Capt. W. J. Milne, master of the C. G. S. "Curley" reports the existence
of an area of local magnetic disturbance southward of Grand Manan Island.
The area is situated 3/4 mile southward Three Islands and is about 150
yards in diameter with depth of water of 12 fathoms. The greatest deflec-
tion of compass observed was 45 degrees. The northern portion of the area
is fixed by the following sextant angles; Gannet Rock lighthouse, 0 deg. 
southwest Head lighthouse Grand Manan Island, 92 deg 42' Whitehead Hill in

feet high; visible 17 miles; iron tower encased in a reinforced concrete
covering; red, polygonal lantern, 55 feet high; visible from all points. 
Diaphone operated by compressed air, gives blast of 3 1/2 seconds duration
every minute. Horn points 77 deg 90 feet above high water mark; situated
near edge of cliff 200 feet northeasterly of the lighthouse. Marine tele-
graph and signal and ice report station. Depot of provisions for ship-
wrecked mariners. In fog, low light may be visible when high obscured or
vice versa. Should the fog siren at Belle Isle south and light station
become disabled, cotton powder bombs will be exploded temporarily every
ten minutes; and if a vessel fog signal is heard in dangerous proximity,
an additional shot will be immediately fired, and the firing will be con-
