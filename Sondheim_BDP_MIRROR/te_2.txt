Bewails (ca. 1996)

An Older Mind bewails nations. It hovers dark, interconnected at 
nodes, sprayed in star-configurations connected across night- 
twinkling-stars, incandescent bulbs streaked with blue at 
magnification 150 just across town. An Older Mind would bend 
deep in Thought, would stir dark waters into dark and stillborn 
Action. An Older Mind would enumerate Nations gaunt and hoary, 
branches of trees rustling the sky stormed into carbon-russet 
darkness. Lightning is sky-crack, cragged break of black 
porcelain, Older Mind Sim-Symbolic illumination burned into 
seven-layered blood-stained retinal booking down to bedrock 
flaked with muscovite.

Older Mind is t = 0, is <=refresh> constant, emission into 
screen-object, sound-object. Older Mind turns at t0 pace, 
haunted as body heaves thrust onto side; it ponders for 
No-Reason, is None. None hurtles downward into No-Reason; only 
nations say split, no capital. Look elsewhere than there. Older 
Mind shudders sky-bowl swollen, crusted with Sim-Symbolic. 
Bewail.

Failure to Overwhelm (ca. 1996)

To theorize the Net, analyze it according to one or another 
model (see below), to examine it without any philosophical 
presuppositions (an impossibility), to include or exclude 
metaphysics: A closed - an academic loop is formed, the 
placement of a book or article (I try for this myself), but what 
occurs beyond this, what reason, what point (reason collapsed to 
a node)?

What can theory _provide_ if it is not, for example, descriptive 
kinesics, software design philosophy, standardization of 
protocols, typifications? It remains an augmentation, appendaged 
to what? Half in and out of the corpus of philosophical 
discourse, applied philosophy, but towards what ends? What? 
(Consider _here_ the onset-characteristics of a trumpet tone.)

There is of course the theorizing of the virtual - from a 
phenomenological viewpoint, theory describing _stuff_ on several 
levels, the _stuffing_ in fact of cyberspace itself, however 
that term is defined, split, deconstructed. Of course there are 
no conclusions; there are, instead, parallels, analogs, 
interstitial or liminal displays of language.

Statistics appear in sociological analysis, almost always soft. 
Structures may or may not emerge. Whatever they're made to speak 
is manufactured. On the other hand, considerations of Being, 
etc. lend themselves to curious metaphysics. These can go 
anywhere, routed in roots.

This _applied_ theory centers it _on topic,_ a source of decay. 
What if there's no theory-otherwise? What theory-otherwise would 
apply? What ghosts enter the maelstrom, alternative selves, 
ectoplasms, staggered or schizzed personalities inhabiting the 
same flesh?

Theory vis-a-vis topicality _here_ is already abject, a vestige 
of territorialized minor philosophy, slide-rule humans 
approaching the discarded object, still clothed and 
canvas-wrapped. Minor philosophy, perhaps in the sense of 
Deleuze and Guattari, minor literature.

Even the psychoanalytics of the space generate ghost shots at a 
new subjectivity - but these things change on an almost daily 
basis.

All this spells ennui, the peculiar analytical burnout where 
cyberspace theory is concerned, entrance and exit _the 
doldrums._ It's partly the socio-political atmosphere of "the 
times," exhaustion as theory becomes mechanism, predictable, 
unused, negative dialectics. On one hand, articulation is all 
there is; on the other, overwhelming information all the way 
down/across, well-definition literally ruling, graduating the 
day. The liminal fails to erupt; the liminal is theorized.

Paul, Sail On (ca. 1996)

If I gather up, will you bury me, will you bury me if I gather 
  up
Your ambergris, your bronze helmet, your amber, your bronze
Swollen by river's wake by cavern opening cavern awakened by the 
  river's swell
Motivated by gutted reeds cut stuttered clay, read in gorgeous 
  monuments gone motivated
If I lie with you, will you lie with me, if I lay with you will 
  you lay with me
Near the pregnant cow near the gutted horse near the emptied 
  house by the coward's prayer
Through the dim dark night by the knight's despair by the armor
  there
If I wash for you by the river's edge and I wash for you by the 
  same edge of the river
Where down the river there is a gathering of knights and women, 
  I think they are celebrating Telipinu at the moment

Yes, I will lie with you, I will lay with you, I will sacrifice, 
  you will sacrifice
Your horse, your cow, yourself, against my golden hair, my eyes 
  of blue
Sparkling in the waters pooling by the marshes, waters sprinkled 
  with blood, swollen with whitened
Bones you have slaughtered, your bones you have slaughtered
While I, while I
  I'm leaving for Telipinu.

dawn* (ca. 1996)

cancers flooding the body in part or in full, tumors attacking 
one or another organ, membrane-spreads of _illnesses of the 
surface,_ attacks on bodies non-virtual of all ages, genders,**

there are millenarian warnings as the human tide heats up, 
microbes approach with landing-gear erect, this is serious as 
insecure bodies escape to the cybersphere, sloughed skin 
dragging them back,

we are close to degeneracy genes gone bad in polluted air not 
responding to antibiotics lost, no longer fortification bunker 
against molecular transformations, lost, in other worlds, the 
air itself,

wires clean wires with electrons, cloyed filaments, carbon dark 
against smoothed electron emissions, tunneling, run around the 
sync clock, skin a sin or shame a dark shadow, no longer named 
but ceased symbolic,

so we slough skins, our poisons trail behind us, so our 
membranes turn translucent, troubled, and there were no tomorrow

source of disease, scoured in the heat of day

suppurations suddenly appearing in the half-year past, 
portending uneasy crawl towards overpopulations, extinctions***

extinctions, ozone, desire, capital, technology, spills, 
desertification, violence for real for sure****

Justice (ca. 1996)

There is no justice in this world! That is, because justice is 
never _of_ or _in_ the world, nor is it a horizon of the world, 
nor of community, nor of the subject. Then one can never be 
just? One can act accordingly, as if justice were a past that 
still encompasses the present. This is the dream, the opium, the 
simulacrum, abstraction, but without it, irrigation disappears 
and selves dissolve, as if they had once existed.

Surge/Cut

http://www.alansondheim.org/surgery.jpg

surgery is from surge, to cut from the body, annihilate;
to surge is to purge, purjery, annihilate the truth, violate
the body politic, violate the corporeal body; to surge is
to annihilate the corporeal politic and the political corpus;
to annihilate is to swallow space and time; to swallow 
space-time; to annihilate surgery and the potential for
surgery; to embrace space and time. thus the 'blown-out' body
of the ancients is the eliminated/purged/expurgated body, the
eviscerated body, the absent body, the absence of absence,
hence dependent-arising. thus the dependent-arising is the
totality of space and time, emptied of body and surgery: that
is the Surge.
