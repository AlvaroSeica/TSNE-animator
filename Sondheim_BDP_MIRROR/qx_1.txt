two philosophical texts

branding

trailing names shuffle inscriptive debris
it doesn't matter anyhow, no one will remember them
among them, nothing, between them, nothing
you see every secret in the world

inoperative trailing is operative
in the virtual, reading is nothing
reading is nothing but phenomena 
in virtual worlds, time is otherwise existent

"All things lack entitihood,
Since change is perceived." (Nagarjuna, trans. Garfield)

disappearance

disappearance of the landscape by virtue of invisibility machine
where the landscape is not, nothing is annihilated
everything is presence and absence, however the life of the screen
the life of the screen is a disappearance, always in the process
