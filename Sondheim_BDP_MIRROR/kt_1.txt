OINTMENT


BECAUSE JENNIFER could 'walk the walk' and 'talk the talk,' because Jenni-
fer dissected the Republican Party precisely as that area beneath the en-
crusted area of the scab, pus-filled and huddled against the all-too-fee-
ble skin, I grant her permission to speak "now, taking over from Alan, al-
though you might not recognize the difference, only that the broken end-
ings of each and every line imply the cauterization of the subject, nece-
ssarily recommencing once again as speech"; no matter, in fact, that ini-
tial reactions tend towards closure. For it is the very _sight_ of Jenni-
fer's "speaking that announces my presence, as if a voice or scream em-
anating from the prison house to which we are all bodily suspect." Never-
theless, not precisely the _sight,_ but the sight as _signifier,_ herald-
ing "a Jennifer-enunciation, the blank neutrality of the symbolic stand-
ing-in for myself" - whether or not recognized by the reader, which cons-
titutes another narrative altogether. "I'm about politics, says the recum-
bent Jennifer, but I'm also about _me._ And if you want to know _me,_ ob-
viously you have to be able to read," at least just a little. In "Jenni-
fer, enunciation meets annunciation, ointment meets ointment, and obvious-
ly as well, that's me all over."
