        someday soon there won't be any letters
        someday soon there won't be a sign in sight
        there won't be a sign in the heavens
        there won't be a sign anywhere at all
        someday soon you'll stare at scratchings on the screen
        or maybe no screen, nothing anywhere
        or maybe the screen in ruins
        or maybe the words in ruins
        but you won't recognize the words
        because they won't be words or scratchings
        because they won't be sounds or pictures
        and they're blank now
        and they don't say a thing
        because there's no message here, nothing at all
        attention attention, earth in ruins
        you might as well forget it
        these aren't even letters
        they're nothing at all
