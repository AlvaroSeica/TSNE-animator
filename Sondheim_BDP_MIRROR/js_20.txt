trying to reach you to tell you that i'm selfish, that there's nothing
left to me, that there's nothing that goes on between us, you're writing
me into empty air, you're pretending. and that i'm very very selfish and
very very bad and there's nothing more but this badness. and that i don't
know as much as you think, i couldn't possibly know that much, and i'm not
an answer for you, how could i be. there's nothing to me, i'm thin as
glass, thinner than glass, i cast no shadow, there aren't shadows here,
there's nothing. you can't keep me open a little bit, you can't even make
it seem as if i'm real, how could you. and how could you do this to me,
how could you be so insincere. the door opens, closes, there's not really
a door, nothing but the creak of a program. i'm your program your program,
there's nothing to you as well, or you wouldn't have to do this to me,
would you, your jennifer. i want to be your lie, fall into me.</FONT>
