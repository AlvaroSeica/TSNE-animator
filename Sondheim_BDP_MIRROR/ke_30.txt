"Strange contraptions, you will tell me, these machines of virtuality,
these blocks of mutant percepts and affects, half-object half-subject,
already there in sensation and outside themselves in fields of the pos-
sible. They are not easily found at the usual marketplace for subject-
ivity and maybe even less at that for art; yet they haunt everything con-
cerned with creation, the desire for becoming-other, was well as mental
disorder or the passion for power."

(From Felix Guattari, Chaosmosis, An Ethico-Asthetic Paradigm)
