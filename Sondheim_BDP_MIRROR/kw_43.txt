seriously, to that turning
where an edge fastens into
same branched flesh, break
in limbs sun-speared, your
neck caught, cauterized, back

hand comes as through the back
curves smooth white flesh down to folds opened
neck of neck

my wish is to be so beautiful that i would never have to
   do anything in the world. i'd wanna be so rich that i'd
   never have to do anything for myself.

overheard, 'i need alice now for who i want to be, and i need
   the person i am with for my new needs.'
