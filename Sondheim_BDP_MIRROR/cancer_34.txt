OF THE binding of names


a shrieking angel falls in the water
& his sodden wings will not fly again
& BIND the name to the number & BIND
& transform the number to the name 

& a shrieking angel will be reassigned,
his name taken up across NETS in this
& every other world, & his name REBOUND
& his number reassigned 

i do fall into the depths of the waters
i do swim among the winged and feathered hollows
& there i do bind this wayward drowning angel
& there i do spoof his useless address UNBOUND 

i will ride high in the midst of NETS & routers
i am the NAME & the NUMBER
i do BIND the NAME & the NUMBER
to my great wings, to thy great wings

ii

Siehe, die Baume _sind,_ and, wandering
among forests of directories and files,
until at the end of the long path,
there are only files, files are only things

veering among beauty, such, placed and cited
across the plateaus of disks and drives,
huddled within the fragments of domains,
turning, transformed, when the glider veers
in our direction, UNBINDING names and numbers

every file leaves itself space
unfathomed, between one and another domain;
it's here that wings, terror terrified
holds to the semblance of the real

but i, i have forsworn the real
huddled in my wings, huddled in thy wings
