STAR TEXT


The program below creates one or another night-time skies near the
center of an erratic globular cluster. In order to run it, all you
need to do is download this post, edit out this text, and place
everything below the dotted line in a file called STAR.BAS which is
then executable. At the DOS prompt, type qbasic star.bas and when
the program comes up, hit the F5 key. That starts it. Try entering
2 at the window prompt and .2 at the config prompt. Play around.

What is the point of all of this? The creation of a universe-image
mirroring or mocking the REWRITE of the posts themselves. The image
eventually will reach close to a steady-state which can be altered
in all sorts of ways by changing the pruning-back constant (.3 in
the example). And the image is designed to play with _peripheral_
vision, occasional events happening just outside the field. (You
should run this on a machine that can support Screen 12 and at least
25-33 Mhz in speed.)

Certainly the model is crude. But I cannot, myself, help attributing
certain catastrophic creations to the unfolding evolution of ...
nothing. And I have designed the model with catastrophe in mind,
plasma-jets constantly annihilating everything in their path - a not
unlikely scenario, give or take ten billion years...
