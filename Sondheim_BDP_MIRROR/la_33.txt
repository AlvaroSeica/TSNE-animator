Vito Hannibal Acconci


She was an ordinary girl from a nowhere place. She came to Hollywood to
make it big and I knew her back when, way back when her name was Carrie.
Carrie was sixteen and just about as sweet as they made them, and back
then they made them sweet. You could take one look in her eyes and know
that was innocence talking and you'd never be the same. I once saw her
stop traffic with her voice; I wouldn't have believed it if I didn't see
it myself. The cars just pulled right over. She sang her poor little heart
out. You'd take one look at her and you'd know she wouldn't last. You'd
take her in and take care of her and ask for nothing back. She would have
given you everything in the world, you thought,and she made your heart big
as all outdoors. I saw the sun rise in her eyes and I thought I'd see it
set, too, but it didn't. Everyone knew she was doomed to failure and
everyone worked hard to make sure she never failed.

I'm an old man now, I could tell you stories, she'd still remember me, it
was just last year I heard she died, I gave her the best parts of my life,
I can still see her then, you wouldn't believe such innocence, her smile
brightened my life, sometimes I hear her call me, I turn around thinking
she's there, I remember her like the day I was born
