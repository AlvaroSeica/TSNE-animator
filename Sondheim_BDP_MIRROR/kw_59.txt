Julu, returned from Asia there were low clouds on the horizon horizon they
were monsoon, they were tsunami the truth of the clouds: my dying in your
arms, Jennifer Jennifer - Jennifer whose arms are hurricane, whose legs
are Santa Annas it was a stretch for me, these clouds they were lowering,
I didn't have a choice it is getting closer to the truth this is moving
more in your direction, with every stroke of the keys, there are strokes
as gifts for you, there are strokes in this world of no ceilings, there
are strokes in this world of no walls: this is a saying of Julu, returned
from Asia; this is a saying of Jennifer-Julu.

Yeah...:Mark::Head Your wet Neck is in my nice Leg Your love seeps into my
Leg - something stretched open to the limit, something held in abeyance:my
thing is my dirty hole of walled up bricks:Julu:knee:  Your giving tongue
is in my thrusting tongue and knee: there are no more, nothing left of me,
nothing Devour giving tongue julu-of-the triple-course-red-brick-tied-up:
something stretched open to the limit, something held in abeyance!
