Which I would pursue, the Way of the animal across a land or semantic 
territory, an evoluted half-definition, quasi-object, inherent and 
inchoate in relation to the (say) partial/dimensional processing of the 
real (see) in David Marr's theory of vision. 

Even if the structure of a language is exact, its concatenations, surface 
contiguities, is not. 

If metaphor (via Lakoff et. al.) reverts (say) to the body, then 
shouldn't we say that ascii, here, limited as to appearance, nevertheless 
retains the embodiment of the fullness of the real? ( I (see) would 
hesitate before saying no. )

We have a lesson in Cantor's mapping of the points of a line onto any 
n-dimensional space, one-for-one, well-definition extended indefinitely.

Say the other with her magic wand (see) which is the bone of an animal 
which is the feather of an animal which is the cry of an animal which is 
the word of an animal made.
