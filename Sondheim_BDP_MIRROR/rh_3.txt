 therefore something should come together 
between the two bodies separated by a serrated division, vertebra one 
among other. pain is this logging-out, is the collapse of the backbone, 
the melting or melding of the body as it begins to disappear.the body's 
not here either, the body is a square, is a playing-field, the body is a 
holding-pen.the i is a stream of i's, of eyes, these appear as if it were, 
but just imminent, as if just momentary, just for a minute.drying, in 
other words a stain or residue, we can say a conversation is a drying, a 
drying-out.in other words, you're saying this is dust, this is red dust, 
this is a failure or faltering, this blows away.it's already no longer 
here.
