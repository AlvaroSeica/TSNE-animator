It's up to an arm

Dirt slopes, tickles around toe rest, tons around toe's fill. A spigot
pours on toe, soapy are wits' drawn, expressing my face. Were armor's
rings kept, toe grind, muscles foldng up the arm. Were gooey jinns throt-
tled by tons of wreck. The neat moat, the poem recited in roads. Tell arm
your secret of armor's sullen angel. The sultry lung, and a host of lost
air. Dirty and thumb. Tell arm: armor eyes soldiered in a fault. Tell arm
the moat - it feels like lying without the arm. Bending towards arm. Fur-
ious energy for armor's spin. Soldier cutting air. Necklace, soldiered
then. Your team snaking throgh armor. It's up to an arm
