These files are remnants, residue, of larger works such as Trilby, 35
minutes in length. The still images are used in video; the .mov files
are chained together, modified; sound is added.

We collude between death and sex, to the limits of distortion - space-time
burns around configurations of terror and the body.

The skin is always a skein of communication. Words are performative only
to the extent they can persuade physical reality beyond the sememe -
propaganda or persuasion of language.

Sexuality, body, language, create a matrix of interpenetrations, an
almost impossible separation of interior and exterior. Space inflates,
the temporal dimension shudders, reverses, cycles, escapes.
