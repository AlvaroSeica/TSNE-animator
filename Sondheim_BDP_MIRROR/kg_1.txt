Unwise Thinking about Japan


In Japan the compression of space is matched by the compression of time in
the United States. Just as kabuki or noh focus on the thin moment and its
holding into other facets, slowly, so does the United States disperse it-
self into plateaus, mountains, suburbs.

Japan measures itself against the eternity of thousand-year-old cherry
trees, shrines before writing. Against this, the disparate symbolic,
piecemeal extensions of techne, imports, accretions. Sometimes the trees
have names. Sometimes the streets do not.

Sometimes more often the signs are no-signs.

The sign is everywhere, as are its interpretations; breaking into pieces,
the signifier is a radical departure.

The gaijin apparently breathes as others; even now, I am defined by my
ability to walk, wear a beard, turnabout into children's stares.

What is total is a misreading down to the ground of history, shinto and
yayoi, or down to for example the pocket monster, rows of talento panels,
dissolves into cherry-blossoms.

The magatama jewel around my neck, protect me against the other signs of
empire, imperial melodrama, the shielding of the sun in the cave until she
comes out, what a terrific dance.

The group writes about what the group is ignorant of. To _know something._
To _be ignorant of_ something, _of_ something. To possess through ignor-
ance. What for example is the height of the world?

To measure the 1342 stone by the side of the highway, I would say three
sanskrit characters about 25 centimeters in height.

I cannot _about._ It would be unwise. It would be ignorant. It would be
mute.
