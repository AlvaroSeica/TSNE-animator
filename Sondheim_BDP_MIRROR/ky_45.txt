tonight


it's cold in here.
two fans and an air-conditioner and there have been thefts.
eight-hundred dollars stolen from a neighbor.
the chipper i mentioned elsewhere, other tools.
two smaller motor-tools from the downstairs workshop.
a man wandering through the halls.
footsteps on the roof.
one man working slowly on the bricks while the inside is robbed.
headlines coming, rapes, muggings, violence everywhere.
the temperature of the hot 3 a.m. air is already rising.
in my spare time i compose headlines of the future.
i arrange it so things will happen accordingly.
i've promised myself some happiness once the weather cools.
someone's clawing at the walls and i'll write him out of the story.
no one was found clawing the walls.
the walls are emptied of human intervention.
the sun comes up with its friend the heat.
i'm happy and haven't lost anything yet.
the world will develop a more beautiful weather.
the loft is funny and warm and comfortable and secure.
the air-conditioner gives its gift to the fans.
i give my gift to you.
