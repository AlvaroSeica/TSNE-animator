Nikuko invented the syllabic script; Izanagi threw it away. Nikuko inven-
ted the wheel; Izanagi rolled it out of site. Nikuko gave fire to humans;
Izanagi stole the flames. Nikuko invented clothing; Izanagi tore it into
shreds. Then Nikuko invented all the kanji, a myriad of signs; Izanagi was
overwhelmed. What can I do with them, he said, There are so many, they
will prove useless to men. But men read and reread the kanji, memorizing
each and every one, and out of the shapes of the signs arose the wheel,
fire, and clothing. Only the syllabic script remained behind, nurtured in
the lives of women, always a chance, in this or any other worlds, of sub-
verting, replacing, the kanji. Thus was hiragana born, as a reminder that
invention and memory can reside, not only in the signs themselves, but
also in the spaces between them.
