Oh when it is so white with snow you can see when you clothes your eyes 
so do so many pretty pictures they do show up on the white snow now
white filled with many fool colors from lights when you press your eyes
Oh when it is so white with snow I do know you are so vary live
I will be tiny snow angel making my hans do many fluster tricks in snow
white trace making many tiny tracks teling you so many pretty pictures
Oh in snow it does so this
so the fine large epick was made in the snow the vary first time
during what we all know is called the snow age
Oh then the snow age made water and the epick was writ down
because it was to be wash away if it were not writ down
so then we can have many telings of so many pretty pictures
Oh my sisther told me she was a vary big shaman
oh my mother told me she was a vary big shaman
my susther and my mother they have many sticks from many trees
Oh you will know these green sticks say my futher
my bruther he told me he was to know these vary green sticks
oh
