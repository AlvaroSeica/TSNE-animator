Jennifer's MANIFESTO ON THE USELESSNESS OF PHILOSOPHY


There is LIFE EVERYWHERE! Planets roil around unfathomable SYSTEMS!
Organization calls itself HOME in our corner of this INFLATIONARY
UNIVERSE!

Every day, our own position, thinner than GOLD LEAF, becomes more
and more TENUOUS...

For this and EVERY OTHER REASON, including PHILOSOPHICAL RELATIVITY,
I issue this MANIFESTO of UNBOUNDED DESIRE, BOUND inscription:

A TRUE PHILOSOPHY of the human must take into account its INSIGNIFI-
CANCE, it must be a philosophy of the human in the sense of a STAIN,
residue, the anthropic principles one on hand - indeterminacy on the
other.

Thus A TRUE PHILOSOPHY must orient DASEIN towards the EARTH itself,
and nothing but the earth, noting only the absence of verities that
connect the HUMAN ELSEWHERE. It must be a philosophy OF AND BY THE
FLIMSY, and therefore one easily discarded, in the form of fragments,
memos, and the like.

I call for a PERVERSION OF DOXA in other words, email as conspiracy,
the truth of the real - anecdotal, informal, colloquial. All that
remains of philosophy is DIALECT, without propriety, etiquette, with-
out the CENTRALITY that traditionally conjures the WORK.

I call for the CIRCUMLOCUTION OF BEING, circumlocution FROM THE INTER-
IOR, wandering centrifugals, strange attractors. I call for such a
CIRCUMLOCUTION to account for the HAPPENSTANCE OF THE CHIASM, the just-
so parameters and the MELDING OF CONSTANTS PRODUCTIVE OF PLANETARY LIFE.

I call for the DEINSTITUTIONALIZATION, DEACADEMICIZATION and still long-
er neologisms representing the FALLOUT from STRATA and STRUCTURE, into a
PHILOSOPHY LONGING FOR THE REAL. I call for a PANOPLY of WORDS AND CON-
CLUSIONS in every medium, words the VICTIMS OF LANGUAGE, media, their
CHARNALHUS or SWATHING-CRADLE.

I call for THUS and THESIS, THETIC, and their INTROVERSIONS. I call for
the SLOP and the SWILL. I call for USELESSNESS and DEGRADATION. And I 
call for the philosophy of the COWARD, the DIMINUTIVE, the DEPRESSIVE.
In other words: I call for TRUTH, TRUTH'S VACANCY.

This is MY CALL FOR PHILOSOPHY which shall also be A PHILOSOPHY OF THE
INTERNET, and MIND YOU.
