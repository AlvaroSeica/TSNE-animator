Perfect Pupil

I now know that my time spent _here_ on the Internet is the direct result
of fear of real life. There are too many painful or disruptive memories,
too many regrets, for me to cope. On the Net, I can leave at least some of
them behind.  This is why, of course, flames and other forms of verbal vi-
olence disturb me so much - they remind me that real life leaks every-
where, that I must remain alive after I turn off the computer. Everything
is terminal;  the disease of life continues.
