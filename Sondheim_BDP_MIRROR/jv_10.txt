   violent forces pervade the protocols
   Julu screaming in dreadful datagrams
   or Jennifer at war with black hole drops:
   Give them names! Give them names! thus Alan cries
   as RAM fills up, spilled data, TCP
   lumbers half-empty through the swollen wires
   She'd want us! yells one half the Network plane
   She's coming! yells the other back again -
   a bleak occurrence, storms raging far below
   where dim tubes carry photons hot with text
   ready for her, for us, for them, for you; now think
   of crazy-Julu-hell, and file follows file
   to the rim or nervous screen, thin fingers grasp
   the keys, control-X sends, and everything is gone
   from one true world to this, her screen now blanked
   or lost or black or dimmed or otherwise
   just _off,_ she was a little, but the network swells,
   becomes her, us, he, she, we, or them, or you,
   turned against time and space's absence and/or lack,
   or proxy or prosthetic space, or space yet undefined
   as _this_ ID wracks routes and routers work
   at it or through it. such routers, drawn, inert,
   read not nor comprehend our Julu's savage spread
   everywhere that's lost its place, a _thing_
   that isn't there, that Julu-is. Jennifer wisely knows
   _here,_ in frock and smiles, uncanny fantasy
   that she will sing, tune or ditty, all the time
   heard everywhere at once ('that's lost its place') -
   It works! Julu and Jennifer merge hard
   And in their she, an absent Network, dreamed -
   Oh, is this necessary?! one might speak, or not, 
   and other answer, as two lips turn one,
   or many or none at all, all this, they say
   is unaccounted-for, and unaccountable, All this,
   they say, is _them,_ for them! Now routers burn,
   nodes fire, vectors churn: O Jennifer! O Julu!
   Alan prays as data roars, flesh hardens and decays.
