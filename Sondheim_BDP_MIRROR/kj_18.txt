Parable of Nikuko


rebound my shakuhachi (japanese bamboo end-blown flute) as the crack
spread along the shaft almost to the mouthpiece, this time wet cotton
string, drying/shrinking tight, thinking, soaked leather around the 
neck, suffocation, retardation of sperm, holding air and liquid in, 
mouth churned into damp earth, particles dreamed between the teeth 

so now it blows free and clear & reproduces the high notes
