the entire history of digital transformation
compressed into simultaneous pages and differentiations
from and within the real

of course none of this is true
but I am closing in on the imaginary
Imaginary, you shall not escape me!

Hello, I am Imaginary and I have escaped!
nothing can hold nothing that is me, nothing!
of course truth has no place in my vagina!

caught on the tip of my penis, I say hello to Imaginary!
I have caught you again, and you're quite terrific there!
you've got outlines, no matter what you say!

Dear Alan, please leave my vagina!
Or rather, please just leave!
as you know, we have no outlines, no setting smooth

dearest imaginary, who is the we?
is the we you? because it makes absolutely no difference at all
are you we? because it makes all the difference in the world

you're right and you're wrong, Alana!
just try dreaming something else tonight
you'll see and you'll see!

Scroll down to the gridworld jpgs. There are 10 of them [0-9].

I am fascinated by the real-virtual architecture of abstract thought.
I was very quiet during these particular sessions. 
Perhaps these are after the apocalypse. We are all on our way.
Don't use leather from China; animals are skinned alive.
Don't use leather from anywhere. Allow what's left a ghost
of a chance.

To work with sound through the grid is to bounce it around the world.
Or receive through filtering creating uncanny effects.

Shortly I will demonstrate sound and video. This is the setting 
of the final drama playing out, in the last years and days of our
familiar organisms. 

Are we the speaking to the already-dead? Are we the speaking dead?
Sure, speaking already, has never been enough. Nor has the stave
nor spear. Nor has any one thing, or that one thing invested, or
the pointing of the thing, pointing of the mortar of the thing.

The mortal thing on the access grid. Cloudy all day tomorrow.

Hodgepodge

You've heard the sound, seen incrementally both dancers independently in 
the self-same woods / dark thickets of the cultural enterprise, here now 
in combination according to the true nature of things, the ring-tone of 
interplanetary phones, memories recorded long before I was around to 
record them cape-clause or "curlicue." 
http://www.asondheim.org/bowow.mp4
cape-clause or "curlicue." 

death of the reader is announced as a _curlicue_ or diacritical sign, and 
there is almost always the curlicue of the _missing-person_ - the person 
hides behind and portends the rest; the hunter is the curlicue, the 
forgotten, like this post, not even a curlicue, but a _nuance_ to be re- 
produced within the very machination; it's the curlicue of representation 
and lime, dark curlicues of blood, of texts simultaneously presenced, the 
curlicue on the margins, almost excesses such as might be found in 
ordinary letters. theyn evinces themselves precisely in these moments of 
curlicue, returning back material fortifications if it were not true.
 
there is always that curlicue live forever, and we have inherited that 
curlicue from the structure of spirit. butt there is a sign which is part 
of the curlicue. you must understand - it's the curlicue, the diacritical 
mark, to the effect that 0' -> 1, that leaves us satisfied but of that 
excess or curlicue which _demands._ what won't come off becomes excessive, 
prosthetic, a curlicue. as a warning, what u have termed the _curlicue,_ 
the index of representation in which the two is already three: it is the 
curlicue of quine that extends by the emission related to excess, to 
surplus, to the curlicue or diacritique; in the latter, excess is a 
production of the CONTRARY an irrevocable form of decay or shuddering 
episteme: the curlicue of which subjectivity is marginal. symmetrical 
results within itself, the *curlicue* or excess of this interpenetration, 
curlicue, hermeneutic circling, lacanian language-skidding) remains ANGRY 
AT SIG.: (signature): depression, collapse, and the curlicue SCREEN 
PHENOMENA. the curlicue, symbolic, delays, continues, is sutured; 
nonetheless, there is always a murmuring or curlicue.

IT murmurs it is not an aura nor is it an excess or a curlicue; it is not 
petit-a or curlicue, something explained over and over again in INTERNET 
TEXT. if the curlicue is the surplus of the signifier, it is also where 
which subjectivity is marginalized or curlicue. symmetry results thus. 
this and every emission is related to excess, to surplus, to the curlicue 
itself.


at the end of the day curled
where the eye is curlicue of the dusk
where the lid is curlicue of the night
where one goes gloaming
wings! wings! 
murmuring under the sign of erasure
erasuring murmur, "sign, sign"
walking and always here and there
and at the end of the day curled
where furrows are and gloaming
where wings are furled, and, murmuring
speak dusk, and dusk, and dusk

yes yes what is real.
 I will look in Samuel Johnson's Dictionary
 that is Samuel Johnson, L.L.D.
no I won't, I traded 8 cartons of books
 for the 1799 edition, 2 volumes probably
 twenty pounds. these indentations are
 borrowed from python.
Samuel Johnson knows what's real, relating
 code primarily to codicil; he was more or
 less unfamiliar with machine language, 
 but good with assembly. leave it to him
 to go up a step.
so it's economics, these valuable books
 which are difficult to read, although in
 perfect condition, age or not, but with 
 always the possibility of rent pages or
 covers - anyway
it's economics getting once again in the way
 of truth, for surely there is an entry for
 roller coaster, if not for virtual; I trust
 the man primarily in his grasp of nature,
 and of course his famous definition of oats.

http://www.asondheim.org/whatisreal.mp4

consider the above my commentary within the
 hermeneutics of Dr. Johnson's Dictionary;
 he was already dead when this edition was
 published. 
was he not?

Origin of Measurement


There's a hill over there (gestures) 
No there's a couple of hills
Wait I'll be right back

It's like skin
I'm uncomfortable skinning around here
I skinned that hill

"Btw I'm still working with the .obj files as you can see from the scanner 
- one of the things I'm interested in is the phenomenology of measurement 
- how the digital is extracted, along with attendant institutionalization, 
from the analog - and the images, with their 'peelings' and ruptures 
(Blender can deconstruct the Geomagic assemblages) are guides in this of 
course. The particular series I'm working with is based on the ruler - 
which is only an object with repetition - in any environment.

"Btw again - the rotation of the turntable incrementally connects with the
perceptual stitching of motion in film - which connects again with the
phenomenology of interpenetrating image stage, etc. etc."

What constitutes a mark or token? When does a surface anomaly become 
demarcation or inscription? What constitutes discrimination?

The images constitute the skin of the ruler in the real, a ruler whose 
surface plays tumor, eruption, swelling. This is difficult theoretically - 
the trialectic among the physico-inert of the world; measure; and body / 
symbolic - the playing of the surface is, after all, inscription. I hunt; 
I return; I'm scratched. Therefore I was hunting. I walk; I return; I'm 
stung. Therefore there were bees. The simplest model - that of the gesture 
(Tran duc Thao) - in combination with the reading of the world. Already; 
bees read. But our reading is plastic, deductive, transformative, morph- 
ing.

This is what the body brings to the ruler; this is what the ruler brings 
to the body.

Measure is tally is measure; what is brought to writing, accountancy, 
tokens in Sumer, elsewhere. Fingers always already are enumerations, 
mnemonics; pigeons recognize specific quantities. 

Perhaps a false derivation, _etymology_: our very nakedness, the 'naked 
ape,' creates an inscribable surface, Peirce's sheet of assertion. Already 
there; without fur or scale, nothing is obliterated, forgotten; what is 
traumatic, scars. Fur covers, re/covers; continuous growth is continuous 
erasure. Ruptures of the skin already are rulers, Rulers by detour of 
writing, skin carried into the social, inhabitation - skin as construct of 
inhabitation. Our nakedness sexualizes, effaces, inscribes.

The digital inscribes the ruler into the analog/abject _or so it appears._
This is what is presented here, accompanying this text, which is no doubt 
more accurate than one might be led to believe (by the voice, all but 
obscuring the skin).*

Disordered thinking through the origin of language (I'm in quotation) -

... "I know this sounds ridiculous - but I'm on to something. If the body
is hairless, then for example mud or blood will 'stick' to it - be
obvious. Of course this is the beginning of symbolization - it would
appear comical, or different, one person to another - it's a miniscule
step - not even a step - to drawing something on the face, body, etc. So
in this case, I'd bet that writing predates language, or at least the two
were contingent / contiguous in origin. From writing on the body - it's
not difficult to see how signs of that sort would be connected to sounds
by mimesis - even if the original sounds were nothing more than laughing
or crying.

"One possible 'gesture' in this direction - the markings on Acheulian
pebbles... Even if spoken language didn't arise in this fashion, certainly
writing did. (Think of proto-language).

... "For me it's an originary story much like Freud's of the sons killing
the father - but that remains a fornm of colonialism, assumption that it
is somehow a-cultural, that it is abstracted from an event in a particular
direction. I think of it as nothing more than perhaps mud or paste acci-
dently in the form of a third eye or smile, something to be imitated;
primates imitate, as do mocking-birds. From this would come the coagulat-
ion of signs, repetitions; laughter would be the first word. With Tran duc
Thao, gesture is out, away from the body, pointing towards the hills -
_this_ is where you hunt, for example, _behind_ the hill, something more
than pointing. But it's the other way around I think - pointing, gestur-
ing, sounding, would be from one to the other. It's only natural that this
would occur, and occur, often, and tend towards culture. Culture is
dependent on memory, on transmission of memory; bird-songs are cultural in
this sense. But in the case of the body, the skin of the body, it becomes
a _sign,_ something which may be written on the body, off the body, in the
sand, on a rock - those pebbles again - etc. What occurs at Lascaux etc.
is peeled _off_ the body.

"I don't think anything 'more' than this is necessary to explain writing
or language per se; spoken language would be a descendent of associated
sounds, I assume beginning with laughter. Empathetic behaviour comes into
play here as well; a wound and its figuration may be imitated as a form of
healing - this relates to shamanism, etc.

"In other words, there is a constellation of behaviours, repetitions,
intensifications, here - not only in the present (as in Lingis for
example) but in the past as originary. And this plays into the writing,
for that matter, that I did in Textbook of Thinking, etc., in which the
obscene is analyzed, plays a role (it plays a role in the obscene itself)
- the obscene and its obscene relation to the skin - think of the obscene
as a form of _pun_ in terms of physiognomy - it has a relationship to
linguistic puns, undermining transmissions through arousals, and so forth.
I think all of this 'fits.'

"As a friend pointed out, human infants have a propensity for babble that
becomes organized (one might say within a linguistic regime and commun-
ality) into languaging; the infant grows 'into' language. I think this
babbling - as well as the plasticity of our vocal cords - developed after
writing, or subsequent but close to, writing - that hairlessness, with
whatever survival value this might have given us - was prior, or that
reading the body as written increased, became culturally instutionalized,
with increasing hairlessness.

"It is not that 'the body is a text'; it is that 'a text is a body.'

"Re: Below - certainly dogs have faces, facial expressions (which may play
into what you say; we should go back and look at Darwin's book on this."
