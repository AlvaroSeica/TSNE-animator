DOWN AND OUT on the Internet, I lost my cybercafe consulting job today. 
They weren't listening to me anyway, and were running with the idea that
events would bring people in; I've always opted for mundane service bene-
fits. Attendance their way is sparse; for all I know, mine might have been
sparser. I may still do some teaching for them, but as for consultancy and
_rent_ that's pretty much gone; I'm back on savings again, watching my
hour approach me on its hoary clock-hands. Sometimes I don't know what's a
meta for. 

Find me a niche and I'll do reasonable work and will promise to make no 
money from it. I've been lucky to live in a small enough ecosystem that I 
can continue writing. Don't fear, though; at 53, my luck's running out 
and sooner or later there won't be copper in the coffer for coffee much 
less rent to rant. The texts will stop with a blister. Lick here.

Alan, sucrose.                                          [5/17/96]
