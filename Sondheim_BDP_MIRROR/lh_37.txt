Parable


Izanagi and Nikuko were outside the Sanjusangen-Do, the great hall with
1001 Kannon. It was there that they met the counter of arrows. I will take
them back, arrange them in the proper order, he said. They are like the
stars, always alone, always together. What is this about, asked Izanagi.
The games that are played here, said Nikuko, the great shooting matches.
And the counter of arrows, asked Izanagi. He is of no account, he has no
bow, and this is his fair livelihood, said Nikuko. Ah, said Izanagi, let
us do something for him, in order that the hall remain intact (i.e. the
arrows were eating away at the beams). Nikuko replied, let him die, reborn
a poet in another life. At that point in 1580, the counter of arrows fell
to the ground, and at that point in 1644, Matsuo Basho was born. But the 
toshi-ya ceremony continued, and the beams became heavy with the strength
of others, weak with the strength of their own.
