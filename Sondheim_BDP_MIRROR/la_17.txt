the laws, somebody decided something
they heard it passed down, they read it in a text
they interfered with the law of gravitation
they said, suspend

different people moved apart from different people until the same went
with the same

the same modified the laws to their liking or they forgot them

they'd heard there was more than one path through the forest
they understood what they heard

we're the people of understanding, they said, one to another

there were interpretations of gravitation but no one understood that the
world was everywhere in the world

if they'd understood that, the troubles wouldn't have started
as it was
someone asked what the laws had to do with anything
she said it properly, spoke clearly, no one had trouble with it
she lost her head over it, it couldn't have been otherwise
the head was the seat of the problems
things that sounded like words came forth

i think they continued for a long while
later the laws, somebody decided something
