skin





/you can't tickle yourself, you loop:/



skin, covering the body with an unmistakable translucency, my fingers 

pressed against layered plushness, resilient with the memory of bone



the body loops through the touch of the other. it doesn't do that in 

cyberspace. it doesn't do that anywhere in cyberspace. forget your dreams 

of virtual reality, hiding out in the suit of the other: it doesn't do 

that in cyberspace



the body is tickled, bruised, caressed, massaged, through the other, the 

body is always already transitive; hungry, it looks for you



you are in the memory of the flesh



transitive, the body lends itself through a looping back towards itself, 

a ring with a gap across which your presence sparks, you bring me 

presence through alterity yes, but through the sameness or suturing of 

touch as well



the metaphoricity of language itself references the body which completes 

it unstated, the body is never produced in language, but language is 

produced embodied



untouching in cyberspace, one borrows the hysteria of love, infinite

effusions, displacements onto language as i have said, with a mouth sliced

like the internet man, language itself microtomed, already microtomed into

the re-assemblage of language



_you are never any closer_



cyberspace burnout is just that distancing, i won't laugh with the touch 

of your fingers, won't transform becalmed with your thumbs pressing into 

the depths of shoulders and neck, won't erect with your teeth on my 

nipple, inscribing yourself forever and ever



never, burnout, my skin sutured back into the body-bag, i can't breath, 

can't breath, but can only _tell_ you that -
