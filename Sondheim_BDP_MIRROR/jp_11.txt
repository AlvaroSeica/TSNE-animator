"We Agree to Disagree: They are Dead Now."


The earth swallows me up. This badger of the end of the millennium con-
ceals everything behind a false front, ideologies on a subterranean level. 
The furrow remains hymenal, inviolate; just beneath the surface, bones. 

What appears as concourse buries the earth's incoherency. There are no
"facts in the matter," only the decaying substance of facts. Hertzian
mechanics, the Tractatus, Euclidean geometries, inscribe the remnants of
truth; in _fact,_ carry its definitions into and out of the trenches of
the First World War.

_The last _fact,_ different in this version than in the _other,_ that is, 
_the _fact_ which in the original text was not italicized in fact; lang-
_uage in fact rests on this basis, taken for granite or ground. There is,
_in fact, this _this_ that we read as if the coherence were always already
_there. Does not one, _always,_ point to _one_ in fact? What are the facts
_which _reign?_

_(Imagine the facts stormed, splattered against the sidewalk, an exhaus-
_tion of facts, exclusionary, an absence of bodies. Iran, I walked, Iraq
_it up. Clouds Scud the sky. Voices yell BASTARD cause there are no par-
_ents. But I sit at the rainbow desk and agree to disagree. Perhaps we
_vote together. That is the _chiasm,_ caught in the _Web._)

Now, war is everywhere. Now, evil. To agree to disagree is to comply. 

Take no prisoners. Harbor no survivors.
