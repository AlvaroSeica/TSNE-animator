Beautiful Stranger of Simmel





When I meet you you are the beautiful stranger of Simmel. Your eyes 

conceal a hunger that made Julia Kristeva worship you! Idolize you! But 

Julia never suspected the truth, my darling, that your flesh is always

already dispersed and I say that in lieu of the fleshmeet that thrusts 

bodies into relations with one another.



It's the project of the flesh which has never begun; the flesh has never 

begun. We're (un)hinged temporally dispersed. 



We thrust ourselves into the digital, replicate exactly one hundred 

hundred hundred times. As if that were enough. Breathless, we replicate 

exactly one hundred hundred hundred hundred times.



Our breath expels our souls. Our eyes engage with hooks and rods. Demons 

enter through our pores. Our cum are simulacra of being-human. Our hair

unnerves us, our nail cuttings ennervate. 



We are thrust into the analog, replicate exactly one hundredth hundredth 

hundredth times. As if that were too much. Exact, counting to ourselves, 

we breath one hundredth hundredth hundredth hundredth times.



Dying within the analog, living within the digital, I remember seeing 

you, the beautiful stranger of Simmel whom Kristeva loves. She always has 

this love in her heart because she's Catholic and filled with love. Jesus 

is a stranger, born unto a manger. 



Jesus' flesh rose up to heaven because he had it self-contained and took 

in the shame that he gave to everyone else. So he could be an object. So 

he had the proper name, the really proper name. Jesus was always polite 

and always got his way.



Everyone else's flesh dispersed, blew all over the place, windstorms, 

nomadic wanderings, diasporas, refugee camps forming a bridge over which 

the strangers crossed, leaving the flesh behind.
