Remnant


This I found, recent, buried in my files on my hard-drive, a tomb or epi-
taph from Jennifer, doubling of pico file structures, account crashed out
and down during the denouement, the tail of the bodily word. It is a mem-
orial for Alan, hardly for Jennifer, writing case-sensitive jennifer,
sensitive to everything about her, the languor of her body as she works
through mosses and worts and lemmings. It is, in short, the _nature_ of
the _culture_ <here>:

it's languor and lunges and a tong altogether, dynasties of tongs and im-
plements just as the uniform is carapace not character / armor, but true
and real revelation in the blacks and whites of the fatherland;

and it's line and length and tinged altogether, tainted with scents and
odors of the true-real body supporting it above and atmospheric, against
blood-red plant-green, the khaki family desert fairy-tale untrue;

and that is the tail of the bodily word, i jennifer always do say.
