face


there are facial scrubbings, sloughed skin, foetal membranes ,,
drawn down over nose and mouth, palls over eyes, burst bubbles,
waters, afterbirths, miscarriages, thinned to blown egg-white 
consistency ,,
*/ what makes you yearn for me for me for me
breathing through albumen, caught against glues held taut across the
ears, lymph-tympana, silked, almost sweet and globular ,,
stumped arms, legs moist and glistening, phantom flailed limbs soaked
in mucous ,,
*/ i so do do do want to understand to understand
understanding through the throat, black bile, bruised abdomens,
cauterizations ,,
yellowed scars, dipthongs and pallid scabs, little stories on
distended skins ,,
*/ i see those boys boys boys
boys and their milky legs, boys and their milky legs ,,
swollen salivary glands, mouth dribbles whitened against pale
contusions, marks of non-memory, dried tears, fleshed-peeled from torn
corners of tumescent eyes ,,
mumblings beneath surfaces, through the nostrils, what, nothing, 
what, what ,,
girls' blood, clotted tastes suffused on paler skin, ruptured dreams
gone long ways back ,,
coming broken to you, i, i, i, i am sick of that letter, of any
letter, of any ,,
*/ does it bother you that letter of any, or a father or a mother?
of you, what a bother ,,
closed up remnants, edged with juices, designs and vomits ,,
and and brocades, and a long way back ,,
and and and drenched clothes, and a longer way ,,
and a way and a longer way ,,
*/ you mentioned that letter of any letter of any?
back back back ,,
*/ can you elaborate on that and look at me?
