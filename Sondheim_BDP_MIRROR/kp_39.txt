shived hunger cloaked, slave-girl with violent tongue, she-male
shined and shaved, distended balls, poised and splayed, almost
as if s/he were alive, you'd have to do that yourself, inflate
the air in the chest's vicinity, produce the guise of stretched
skin, flesh bound to please - or maybe you're tied up, a fashion
of oiled surfaces, reflecting worlds and fingers, violent tongues
and naked penises, stroking, writing themselves into impossible
surfaces of what makes up a world so safe as to be inconceivable.
