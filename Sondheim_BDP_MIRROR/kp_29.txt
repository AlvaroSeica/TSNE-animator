(Alan) oh of course, for me too - mistress and begging seem to do it ...
(Alan) It also has to do with the position of my body - I might write about
 this -
(Alan) I imagine myself either beneath you, or naked, bent over, facing away
 from you -
(Alan) As if I were a blank slate you could write yourself upon, or efface me
 totally for that matter -
(Alan) So that my nipples, cock, arms and legs were matters of punctuation -
(Alan) Or my face might be a responder to you, in the form of a broken mirror -
(Alan) As if you're making a world out of me, reflecting your own -
(Alan) But it can only do that with a certain degree of distortion - I could
 never fulfill you -
(Alan) Limits everywhere, I'm humbled by them, turn myself inside out for you,
 beg from you -
(Alan) Anyway, yes, mistress and begging are two poles of fantasy here...
(Alan) I'm naked, splayed, supine from one to the other
(Alan) So I could write all of this up, publicly to you, my secret muse
(Alan) A way of thinking through obsequious giving and taking
(Alan) Learning the landscape and language of the body that refuses landscape
 and language
(Alan) Ah.................
