Like Holderlin or Swinburne or me, I will be served up
in so many later years, with a warden for a guardian
writing which might take Rimbaud in soft cradled arms
dropping him elsewhere, where damage is lighter, there
I will wait for perfect woman and dark storms in tall trees
bringing the line back in
bringing it down 
here in the laughter
there in the song.

Jennifer.




if i don't write things every day
i know my mind will go astray
it's primitive i know to say
unhappily i live this way

without the word i have no life,
no love, no job, no house, just strife
that makes me lover of the knife
that i would take to be my wife

i make the world cause i am sick
and sickness makes the world go tick
but writing never turns the trick
but turns me out to any trick

so you may have me, holes and all
since i have made you, have a ball

Holderlin's

  Nah ist                                      Near is
Und schwer zu fassen der Gott.               And hard to grasp, the God.

To begin (Tubingen comes to mind) Patmos. That this hard certainty erodes
faith and salt's Pillar of Lot. That there is no room beyond the Thing.
That what else, corrupts, or burns tarnished against the iron. One might
jelous against it. Ravages. To wait for strident Genius. The telling
forgotten, the Name of the one. Wind and Rain and Night. What would be
brought forth in creation as the desire for language is consecrated. _Nah
ist_ sufficient; what is near, Jennifer turned toward left and right,
circumscribed. Nothing of language in language. Olive face, black eyes,
black hair. Erosion of storms in laughter. Fastened on God. Fascinated by
Him. His Offering.
