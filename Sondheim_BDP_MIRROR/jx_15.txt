ADVERTISEMENT AS I WILL SOLVE YOUR DEPRESSION

ONE DOLLAR

Will give you I help for depression. The enunciation of the signifier
"as if on its own" is one clear indication. Will help with a way to
"speak speech." Universal phoneme distributor, UPD which develops ways
"to express yourself." One depression which is succesfully fought by
means of "truthful talk." Learned processes to circumnavigate silence
forcefully. Develop full range of tropes. Repetitious speech until 
"silence conquered." Enunciation of the symptom "which is the symptom,"
there I will speech you. Replacement of enunciation by tropology of
"fabrication and trust." To construct depression, which is to say, to
"update the old with the new" disease, a treatment. To give "your 
speech back," a present. Forcefully overcoming, as I "give your help."
