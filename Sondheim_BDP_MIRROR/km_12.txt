                         your man.
                         my hair
                         his fingers.
                         your drama.


is the text of a billboard advertisement over fourth avenue and pacific
street, an image of a young woman of color with great hair staring out at
the camera which becomes you on the street: who are you? who am i?

just thought you might want to ask these questions when wondering who is
speaking to you as you run your fingers through your hair, typing your
answer on the keyboard, dreaming one last sad sad time of the _dramatic-
script boy_ who has you somewhere in his scripts, or does he or will he -

for it's the truth that, as newton's equation in the calculus of finite
differences indicates, any script can be written after the fact - you
might want to speak to _dramatic-script boy_ before making any quick
decisions in these matters -

meanwhile _the continuity girl_ wants you to be me - all of them are in
collusion she feels, tracking down one or another emission - the screen's
hot with them, lifeforms pouring out of machines all over the planet -

meanwhile again, jennifer notices still another attempt to find signs of
life elsewhere in the cosmos has led to null results (sci. amer. this
month), and so and then again, the spectre of the very anthropic cons-
tructs of our universe appears -

that the world is constituted in such a manner that intelligent forms of
life appear relatively suddenly in the evolutionary process, discover
nuclear energy and weapons of high destruction, and extinguish themselves
just on the verge of reaching for the moons, the planets, the stars, the
universe itself - too much power, too little time -

there are no exceptions -

it is built-in with these inflationary-universe times, it's the way things
are, the neutral and tragic foreclosing of the world we live in - it's the
first and last atomic fact - it's all of us -

there are no exceptions - 

                         your drama.
