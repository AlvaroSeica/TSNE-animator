Netted = Death = Text

I've been sending out writing / images / video / audio since the beginning 
of 1994. writing = codework = theory - everything. images = difficult to 
classify. video = the usual as well as executables. audio = radio = music 
= sound. Perfect moments. The project is moribund, decayed. Jennifer's 
excitement disappeared a long time ago. The open space has closed as the 
text = me tends to suture itself = suture myself. It was never a space. It 
was swill. I perform emptiness. If I send out a suicide note = nothing. I 
await a Grand Inquisitor. I misuse alphabets, bits and bytes, pixels, 
email lists. I become a sickness unto death. I inhabit no-man's land where 
I am braced. I write myself into myself. I swallow my words like a Jew. 
Another file where I remember writing crash-land Tokyo, Nikuko, Travis, 
Honey, Tiffany, Julu, Alan, Jennifer, Doctor Leopold Konninger. The sick- 
ness of the Doctor is my own. Cut to early video: supine Azure calling: 
Doctor, Doctor. The Doctor is a special case, intransitive. The Doctor 
begins and ends _there._ I work my fingers down to dead music = bone. I 
make the bone = gift = Second Life flaccid. I give you space to swallow. 
My space is stolen from me and they thieve my prims = things = shapes = 
nothing. Sky = nothing = earth. Damp sky = certain smell. I am your files 
and corrosion. I am your fluids which you dry on your bits and bytes. Here 
I wait my death and the death of my work. My missiles have no mission. My 
posts are crossed and crowded. The signature of my fraud will disappear. 
You will find my splices melted, my tapes sick with print-through. A dream
= offer my archives for ten thousand, all my work = fear no one will buy. 
Online I compete with noise = my skull rots within. Someday this will stop 
= that moment of inbox automated erasure = kill or delete. In my sickness 
I delete. In my sickness I = I
