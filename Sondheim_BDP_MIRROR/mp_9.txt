In September, 1752, September 3-13 did not exist.
In September, 1752, September 11 did not exist.
The ghost of the future visits a past 250 years ago.
We did find the couple from the Towers suspended in mid-air,
their skin touching skin, screaming what words in 200-kph wind
rushing towards them, the ground rushing -
floors collapsing in the great container behind them - 
strusses breaking - speed picking up -
as weight is added to weight - but never the speed
of people falling, turned internally to dust and fire -
the charisma of burned flesh - not left, for a moment - whole
and together and identified -
In September, 1752, the collision and recuperation of calenders -
the elimination of these autumnal days -
they're turned around - the future anterior of ghosts -
already visited (everyone's living there)
(everyone's waiting for the earth to start again)
