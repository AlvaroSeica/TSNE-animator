clone me, you'll never have to see my swollen open body
clone me, perfect clean room, surgeon hermeneutic
you won't have to fuck me, won't have to touch my holes
you won't have to run the bypass of the tongue or the finger
you won't have to run the techne of the rope or the clothespin

clone me, there won't be any detours
the sounds will be repetitive, murmured hydraulics, valves
no stains around the bed of brilliant birth
no scents hovered in heated murmured air
you already know this
'you already know this'

cloning's useful for my survival
i am my genes, my genes, my texts and images
my texts and images, my bits and bytes

where i am, dream of my 'swollen open body'
there's nothing to say, 'you already know this'

you've already seen the original
you've already dreamed it
there's no difference! 
'there's no difference!'
