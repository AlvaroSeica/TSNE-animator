ginelle bringing the flowers, sprigs of holly, tulips, to
ginevra dancing in white toga beside tree with laughing
ginger! who shall go the distance, cross the brook for
ginni, running in the distance near the mountain shadow?
ginnie shall go, shall run and skip so merrily, and
ginnifer will go as well, carrying baskets of flowers!
ginny, shall you go with me, dance beneath the maple tree?
giorgia, will you go as well, gaily dancing by the pool?
giovanna bringing streamers, smart fruit from lovely
gipsy, singing! as the sun begins to set, dark svelte
giralda steps forth, crying as soft shadows deepen.
