iiiiii P of I

I can't write anything but stupid examples. If humans aren't mewling about 
the limits of the text, they're mewling about death and its horizon, text-
ual and non-. Whatever's said is simultaneously irreducibly stained and
reduction. The examples are trivial. It's all helpless, a return to Dosto-
evsky's underground absurdities. Where's Sonia when we need her? For that
matter, Jennifer's been quiet lately... And I'm sick in my liver, bitter
in this season apropos of the wet snow, some of you know what I'm talking
about.
