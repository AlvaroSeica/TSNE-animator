How I can lie to myself here


What you don't see in this space is how bad I am.
I can always put my best foot forward.
I can be the beautiful person I've always wanted to be, not filled with 
decay and the dissolution of the thing.
You can't see that I'm damaged and that only some of you know how.
You can't understand what my regrets are, the sad story of losing my 
virginity, the story of the miscarriage, the story of the student 
suicide, the story of initialed names carved into absent substance.
Some of us are composed of narratives we can never escape.
My narratives clash in the night like warring armies of valiant women.
We appear as within the appearance of a character within the story.
The women storm me storm you, the women storm cyberspace.
The Internet is perfect for us; I am lifeless.
The Internet is stories and those of us who have stories, who are 
burdened by them, appear here.
And some of us will tell the stories, and some of us won't. 
But they are always there guiding us, and there are no women, no clashing 
armies, and there are only pathetic pawings over graves.
N1 moved in the day I met her, N2 went crazy, K cried wailing outside the 
door, G1 was abandoned, G2 killed herself.
I am only a story. I am a good story, and a bad one at that.
