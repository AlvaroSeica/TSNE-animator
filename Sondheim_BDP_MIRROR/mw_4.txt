sauntering long ago


in the northern darkness the fish has its name kun, of it no idea how many 
thousand li, and it's a bird and it's name is peng, yes it is, it's got an 
enormous back, i've got no idea how many li it is, when it gets angry or 
aroused then it takes off and its wings! its wings! you can't imagine how 
big they are, anyway an anhinga and an atala butterfly were talking and 
saying to each other, wow, you just can't fly high enough to see the whole 
pond which was in a cut that shook the water but seemed much larger. so 
they said, the story is in the northern darkness, etc. that's how big the 
world is, so big that you can't imagine or even walk through it. and what 
comes out of the northern darkness goes into the southern darkness, yes it 
does, i can't imagine how it does that, but it does. i don't think it sees 
much of anything either, but then how should i know, its colors are 
amazing, maybe it's because it's so large there's room for everything, i 
think maybe it's a bird called peng, but some say it's a fish called kun, 
but how could fish fly, and how could a bird swim across the darkness so 
far it goes from north to south, you can head north and arrive south, you 
can head south and arrive north, a white horse is black, a dog isn't a 
dog, you never know, loafing long ago and floating just about in any 
direction, in the south, something stirs for three thousand li, some say 
it's the waters, some just can't imagine
