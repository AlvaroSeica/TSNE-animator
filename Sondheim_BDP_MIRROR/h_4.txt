imagine the bone with the attachment of tendons, tissued burrowed or 

borrowed, furrowed tissues slathered dark into the wormholes of place, 

the living marrow, the skeletal girdering of the weight of surrounding 

space 



you imagine space now imagine desire



which performs the operations of the space, my body circulating, probing, 

a question of response, bone groaned against bone but with the difference 

of tissue lending skin to skin to touch



"You loved Ishullanu, your father's gardener,

Who was always bringing you baskets of dates.

They brightened your table every day;

You lifted your eyes to him and went to him

'My own Ishullanu, let us enjoy your strength,

So put out your hand and touch our vulva!'

But Ishullanu said to you,

Rushes would be my only covering against the cold.'
