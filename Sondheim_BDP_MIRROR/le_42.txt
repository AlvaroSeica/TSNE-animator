there is no ROUSSEAU in ROUSSEAU; ROUSSEAU grapples and greps ROUSSEAU,
toadler:*:3850:99:todd bROUS:/net/u/6/t/toadler:/usr/local/bin/tcsh alone
appears for cat /etc/passwd | grep ROUS, the EAU turning later on, along
comEAU:*:1682:99:greg comEAU:/net/u/12/c/comEAU:/usr/local/bin/ksh
darren:*:4507:99:darren fieulletEAU:/net/u/6/d/darren:/usr/local/bin/ksh
damfino:*:11627:99:robert deverEAUx:/net/u/17/d/damfino:/usr/local/bin/zsh
bEAUgard:*:16637:99:ed bEAUgard:/net/u/1/b/bEAUgard:/usr/local/bin/bash
and we forget the other cat/etc/passwd | grep s, the other _s_ or the _s
of the other,_ there is no place for it; it remains sightless: ROUS s EAU,
one remove from the water. there is no reason in ROUSSEAU; ROUSSEAU shakes
ROUSSEAU in sleep, what murmurs! what songs -

ROUSSEAU can't find him anywhere!
ROUSSEAU can't find me anywhere!
ROUSSEAU can't find her anywhere!
ROUSSEAU can't find you anywhere!

There's no ROUSSEAU in ROUSSEAU; the word takes a walk. Reveries: Late in
the afternoon when the village is half-asleep and only the forge of the
blacksmith sounds outside my door, I walk out into the world, and no one
cares. Were my ideas more of a poverty, were my thought itself disgraced,
there would be no one to blame but myself; now, however, I find myself in
doubt of everyone, and it is only during the hours of sleep that I become
a boon companion.

Oh ROUSSEAU of no ROUSSEAU, to whom do you talk! I love to listen, cradle
your book against my naked breast, my milk nursing your poor chapped mouth
and eager lips. ROUSSEAU is no ROUSSEAU, broken and dispersed among the
password files ranged across machines; the social contract has long been
abandoned in favor of the rustle of bytes and nibbles. The whole world is
hungry for the pure liquid of your thought. Let me flow through you,
resurrect you! The world needs your walking limbs! The world needs your
tongue!

There is no ROUSSEAU in ROUSSEAU. There are no survivors.
