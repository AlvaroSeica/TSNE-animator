Parable


Nikuko was resting at Dazaifu. Izanagi said, Nikuko, how many kami, beyond
the eight or eighty million. There were kami everywhere, pouring from the
stones, from the blades of grass, from the hills. There were kami gathered
in the shrines, shadows swimming without a ripple, beneath the surface of
the ponds. Nikuko replied, Sometimes it's not even me who's speaking,
they're swarming within me, sometimes one or another speaks, their words
escape me and new shrines are built, one even even made a world so fragile
it destroyed itself. Izanagi replied, And I, Nikuko, what is within me.
Nikuko replied, The blades of grass, the hills and pools here, worlds of
inconceivable fragility. Suddenly Izanagi split open and the same world
emerged and settled down, with Izanagi in it. This is the 'Enlightenment
of Izanagi.'
