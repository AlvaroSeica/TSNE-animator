the most beautiful thing in the world, light gleams light
light moving from one to another room
there is light flowing from the window
light seeping beneath the door, light over the transom
 ^breathing
the light murmurs deep into the floor, walls, ceiling
light gleams light, in another room
in another room, the ceiling has sent emissions
there are dull glows, surfaces murmuring to surfaces
nothing is ever in silence, nothing in void
nothing in abyssal vacuum 
nothing ungleaming with the beauty and light of the world
 ^breathing
with illuminations no matter how faint, how subtle
how subtle is the shimmer of heat, radio elasticity
elasticity of the world murmuring the world
the gleaming of light gleaming light
