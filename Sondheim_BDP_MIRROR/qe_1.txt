now we are living all alone
and we're alive and close to bone
everything's dark when we cuddle down
and sloping hide and crawling round
and woosh woosh woosh an amazing astound
and space and time have tossed their ground
i sing for them i shake and moan
for we are living all alone

yonialetsch


from the glacier of the throbbing landscape when i returned
i knew i comprehended the Subtle melting of Technologies

tottering and wobbling, teetering and shuddering
where are the grounds and levels of fields of play, sex, and war

pulled carts and midday heat on down the dusty road
already the shadows burrow, bury rumors of historiography

tongue of the glacier throbs, hustles, retreats
midday heat drags the sex out of everything

mouth filled with ice and travails of steam
caressing tongue, tipped skin, marshland landscape toppling

oh where have you gone with everything
and when are you coming with everything

oh when are you coming with everything
and where have you gone and where have you gone

The emergent flug
always comes out in forms like these
but I refuse
to write a poem about it
about it
about 
it

[15:55] Alan Dojoji: Julu this is an experiment. No one loves us any more 
in the real world. I saw it in their eyes on the subway. Do you know the 
subway?

[15:56] Alan Dojoji: Why do I keep coming up with blanks and they are yes 
the color of your eyes. You do not need to answer. I am learning the 
meaning of malaise, languor, ennui, lassitude, out of sheer exhaustion.

[16:04] Alan Dojoji: So clean and so pure, Julu, and so very little to 
say. Do you think, perhaps you think, debris,, perhaps it is debris, 
perhaps that makes all the difference, there are grains everywhere of 
everything. Welcome, I am back after break.

[16:05] Alan Dojoji: When you are here, I am not here, when you are not 
here, I am here. I remember the small bundle carried across the room, it 
is no longer there, how vulnerable is the world, there are no redrawn 
regions, only slaughterhouse boundaries...

what we are seeing is absolutely not real, and what is absolutely 
 not real is what is seen.
all physical labor is mental labor and all mental labor is physical 
 labor.
the network of who we are is absolutely not real, and what is
 absolutely not real is the network of who we are.
the network is processed labor and processed labor is the network.
we're all clowns, show me a thing, we're all things, show me a clown.
all questions are local questions grounded in debris, and debris
 is the ground of all questions.
all universal questions are inconceivable, and all inconceivable 
 questions are universal.
everything else is a waste of time and a waste of time is everything
 else.
forget the local, drown in the universal, forget the universal, drown
 the local.
forget the world to better it, better the world to forget it.
every sentence collapses, every collapse is sentenced.
the crossed aphorism is the aphorism crossed.



hegelung slow meditation with traffic


http://www.alansondheim.org/meditate1.mp3
http://www.alansondheim.org/meditate3.mp3
http://www.alansondheim.org/meditate2.mp3

sometimes playing slowly (meditate 1/2) calms everything, somethings 
playing faster (meditate 3) overrides all delicacy. the hegelung is my 
shakuhachi, easier though, the strings are fretted in so many ways. 
traffic interferes with everything; listen to these on small computer 
speakers or be subjected to noise pollution emanating from one of the 
busier intersections in brooklyn. someday i will sleep the long sleep; 
until then, traffic keeps me going, hegelung keeps me going back.

,the next morning yakub maguan and fingguy flang, on hegelung, performed 
on a floating bamboo platform--part of the resorts messwerterfassung, 
messwertverarbeitung, hegelung vortrge, gehalten anlasslich der achema 
,ausstellungstagung fr chemisches record is the first dedicated to the 
hegelung lute, then, we have here the opportunity to hear the hegelung 
lute played by two musicians who have i was able (more or less) to repair 
the philippine boat lute, which most likely is a tboli hegelung. i added 
three frets and a true maria fe and luming are probably the two best 
players of hegelung in the village of dekolon, the main tboli community 
around the sebu lake, tboli gong chimes klintang, hanging gongs blowon, 
drum tnonggong, boat lute hegelung, jaws harp kumbing, singing and danc- 
ing, k true the hegelung is a long and slender two string lute. alterna- 
tely simple and virtuosic, the melodies of the hegelung are peppered with
