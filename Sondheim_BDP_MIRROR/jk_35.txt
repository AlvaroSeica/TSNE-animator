The Most True of All I want to Say


I don't say anything much anymore but I watch and read and I'm very care-
ful in what I write and I take _note._ And what I _note_ is that everyone
writes to _you,_ whoever you are; that _you_ are at the end of every post
and every text, every aside and every response. _You_ are absent from the
bed, _you_ are just around the corner, _you_ are always reading, always
watching - or _you_ are never reading, never watching.

Indeed, would I write to _you_ if you were reading? Isn't every post a cry
for _you,_ public in the absence of your presence, the absence of reply?

You are not in the bed, you are not in the room, you are not in the home,
you are not down the street, in the town or city, in the province. Or you
are _not,_ there is no you, a knot of you, a tangle.

Your absence makes my presence, our presence, hopeless. Since you do not
find us, since you do not find us pathetic, we are as such. Since you do
not find us, we are the written of the dead.

Now I will put a stamp on this and mail it out, says Jennifer.
