A Season of Thought


Afflict your flesh with hunger and vigils and apply yourself tirelessly 
to psalmody and prayer; then the sanctifying gift of self-restraint will
descend upon you and bring you love.

- St Maximos the Confessor

Many ascend the cross of mortification, but few consent to be nailed to
it. For many submit to hardships and afflictions of their own choosing,
but only those who have died completely to this world and to the respite
it offers readily submit to the sufferings that come against their will.

- Ilias the Presbyter

A man who through ascetic effort withers the flower of the flesh, and cuts
off all its desires, bears in his mortal flesh the marks of the Lord.

- St Theodoros the Great Ascetic

- Compiled by Doctor Leopold Konninger from the Philokalia
