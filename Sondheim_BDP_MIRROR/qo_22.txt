Ritual

Over a hundred times I've had to follow the paths below, adding new files
to the Internet Text as they _accumulate,_ transform into theoretical sub-
stance. Last night, file ff was added to the rest, and the net index was
updated. The files are easily retrievable; the whole morass is around
four megabytes of solid bristly ascii. 

I travel from panix.com to the site at jefferson.village.virginia.edu, and
then: 

341	cd ftp.archives/cybermind-digest.archive/internet
342	ftp panix3.panix.com	[getting file]
343	wc ff				
344	ls -l ee		[checking permissions]
345	chmod 664 ff		
346	ls -l ff		[changing, checking permissions]
347	cd
348	cd public_html
349	pico internet_txt.html	[adding access on home-page for filename]
350	ftp panix3.panix.com	[preparing home-page for download]
351	exit
352	cd ftp.archives/cybermind-digest.archive/internet
353	ls -l netindex.txt
354	rm netindex.txt		[removing old index for Internet Text]
355	ftp panix3.panix.com	[adding new index]
356	chmod 664 netindex.txt
357	ls -l netindex.txt	[checking permissions]

I exit, enter internet_txt.html from panix.com, make sure everything is
running properly. I have had to change the netindex.txt first, by down-
loading ff, and toggling between it and online. The index has grown to
390 entries, something for everybody. It's spidery, out of control; it 
has bones in it. The sequence above, server-side, is the bi-weekly stir-
ring of the soup.

Writing in Minimal Fare


Writing in Pico in the linux or unix shell strips away excess; what 
remains is inner speech, a dialog of thought unencumbered by design. It's 
difficult to work within boxes, colors, menu systems, corporate or other 
headings. Here I think through the movement of concepts, ideas, emotions; 
there, I founder on the barriers of software design. True enough, Pico 
itself is design, but the design minimal; what is visible is primarily a 
window of unadorned text, processed by a minimal number of commands. There 
are no distracting images, no sounds or other annoyances (the arrival of 
new mail, instant messaging, banner ads). It's as if writing has returned 
to its source in the body and stele or table, and lost in eternity, stone 
hardened writing should tend only towards existence. the self-inscribed 
desire sexuality desire's written for & conceivable tablet, there are 
others that Reading _on_ virtual-real bodyonly to disappear, write

Poetics in Internet Text

crossing of words, language and its poetics, is an undertow, vectoried

I don't comprehend haiku; I do comprehend zen poetics. I don't comprehend

of the poetics of technology and the bypass of the circulatory systems of
shrapnel beyond experimental poetics.
