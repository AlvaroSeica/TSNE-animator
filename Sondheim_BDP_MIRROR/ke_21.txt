A Bush Incident


In the bush, nothing was visible. The sky was brilliant blue-white and
the ground was cluttered with ground-clutter and there were trees
everywhere but nothing to see beyond the immediate road ahead. There
were also sounds, however, just a moment or fragment of sounds, I'd
say fwoomph fwoomph for example as something quite large was _jumping_
just beyond us, invisible. The fwoomph fwoomph circled our place,
where we were and would always be (although a mobile site to be sure),
as if a large sullen dotted line were drawn in the area. Now I do de-
clare this was the eeriest thing I have heard since I have been abroad
here or anywhere else, this fwoomph fwoomph, perfectly in rhythm with
itself, as some great kangaroo kept out of our way, perhaps in flight
or attack, perhaps thinking of it or thinking the better of it, but
within an elsewhere, in the sense of a yearning or nostalgia for a
better life, that could never be achieved. So we were there as a lack
in the center, and this intelligence circled us on the late summer day
and we were never, from that moment on, the wiser.
