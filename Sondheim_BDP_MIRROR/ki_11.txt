"From her Avatar Byoin"


_Liar, liar, pants on fire!_

My name is Alan and where the fuck are you, Nikuko.
Nikuko, 8 people got shot here tonight and the bones
are falling apart, and there are scream butterflies in the streets
and I see you in every Japanese woman's face in town, no,
in every American girl's face, or as you would say,
8 people got shot here tonight, 
la
lala
8 people got shot here tonight

My name is Alan and I'm feverish and ill, it's something old, new, old,
when my health was all I have and horde, tiny bits of magatama health,
stretching the skin over the bones without too many lacerations,
folding the skin between the bones without too many scars, contusions,
and I want to dig out my health and throw it away, Nikuko,
I want you to come back here, Nikuko, you can pick up my health,
you can put it in your cunt, Nikuko, you can carry it anywhere,
lala
lala lala

My health smells like life, but it's a semblance of life,
it's a photo of life, life's spectacle, imaginary,
it wrapped for you, I don't need it any more, don't have it,
it's waiting like a ball for you, like a top or a mountain,
like a cave or a valley, where the fuck are you, Nikuko,
come and rescue me, stop laughing at the 8 who got shot,
my health is yours hack hack cough cough, blood on the floor,
faces in the blood, holes in the faces, kanji in the holes,
lala lala
lala lala lala lala

where the fuck are you, Nikuko, put my health in your cunt,
like a bone or a stone, like a stick, like a slab,
put the letter in the sleeve, put the bone in the letter,
where the fuck are you, Nikuko, 
let me rattle a death, now leave me alone
lala lala lala lala
lala lala lala lala lala lala lala lala
