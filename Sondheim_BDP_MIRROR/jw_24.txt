	  Mira I will wash the feet of my Lord and Will Sit
	    Mira at this Washing of the Feet and they will
     Mira make of This a Shrine of a Pool of Water and They will
	  Mira Make of this a Goal of Pilgrimage and I Mira
	       Mira Will be Your Slave, and I will Tend
	    Mira the Lines of Men and Women, and I will Be
Mira the tears from Your Eyes, And I will Wipe your Eyes Dry of These
 Mira Yours Tears, and I will Wipe the Sweat from your Brow and Oh So
   Mira Careful I will Dust by thy Footprints on the Road and Oh So
 Mira careful They will be Hide from You Know Who which is of My Name
Mira of Mira will be for you Of That Darshan and You Will Know Him and
Mira You Will Know Her and There is a Red Thread Across the River and
Mira There is A Red Path of Red Dust by the Thread and I will be Your
 Mira Guide by This River and I will Walk along the Red Thread by the
  Mira Red Path in the Red Dust and I will Wash your Feet and I will
			 Mira Wash your Feet
