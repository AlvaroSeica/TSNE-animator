[I've been extremely impressed by the work that is going on here in Cape
Breton, using or developing the Internet for a variety of purposes. I was
also impressed by other CMC projects at various institutions in Australia
and the United States, vis-a-vis Native Peoples or isolated populations.

is more a request for comments - i.e. other examples and directions - than
anything else. Please send in any relative comments or additional infor-
mation.)
