moving somewhere else another space to write in.  Later: what will be the
combining?  An arrangement of stones thick and swollen - quartzes and
granites on the ground (perhaps the desert).  Your arms working the stones
working them - that's what you're thinking about, you're looking at me;
there are other spaces of alterity.  But there was only one, a marvel or a
travel."  0 0 2>>  "She squeezed her breast hard, her nipples swollen nubs
rending her soul; pain was her world, arched-back-body thought a marvel or
a travel.  My arms wrote from distended cock, wired hard against bruised
skin.  The room smelled of holes and human debris (a marvel or a travel),
and my arms writing smelled of holes and human debris: broken arms, legs,
used-up whores, dead soldiers with cocks stuffed in mouths - gay laughter
of little children HA HA HA, or a moment or a movement of your arms."
