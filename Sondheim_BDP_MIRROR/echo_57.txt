Parables





Daishin Nikuko says, don't you see that everything I do is towards my

death, towards dying, that my economy is the economy of death. Daishin

Nikuko says, when will you grasp this truth. A name is a marker of death.



Daishin Nikuko came across a blind man, a writer of parables, by the bank 

of a river.

You are my eyes, she said to him.

You are my parable, he replied.



Daishin Nikuko met a lion in the desert. Where have you strayed from,

she said. I have strayed from the flock, said the lion. Mine or yours,

she said. The difference of the hunter is not the difference of the

prey. If it were, she said, there would be no hunters. If it were,

said the lion, there would be no prey.
