I do not know, but that I identify with the life of Vaslav Nijinsky.
It is not a question of madness, but of a body perfectly attuned to
_becoming_ in all domains, thus a body freed of the technological,
downed by its own impulses. I imagine him dancing, sparks shunted 
from the nipples, glows in the ground itself.

Dance does move the body with nothing and dance contains the connec-
tion of the body with the body. An arm does not emerge from a leg, 
nor does a nipple sprout a finger. But a neck turns beneath the arms, 
and the organs of the face thrust themselves close to ground or be-
neath the throat.

It is so silent that it is not a language of its own. Nijinsky opens
to impossibilities. He says, nothing remains when the ground's cleared
for planting. He says, it is not a question of seeds. Who is this Bro-
nislava Nijinska who dances in the Diaghilev Ballet?

Here, the fingers dance deliberate their moment of damnation, black re-
petitions going nowhere, drowned figures washed up on violent shores.
There, the body is a rediscovery, mobile shoals strewn across inert and
silent islands - continuously born until three decades have passed, then 
uncanny and passing for wraith.
