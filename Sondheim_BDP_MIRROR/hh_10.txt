Gauged Sedge, Leave Message

 
From Cybermine Talker, My September Message To You:

From: Alan , 24/8/1996 at 19:01
When things are difficult and there is no beginning
And there is no ending to their difficulty
And they lie entwined like lovers speaking for the last time
About the nature of _things_ and _things_ are in the way
Of things and lovers; then appear in this space once and forever
To heal, ascertain, overcome, measure their beginning
Of everything and all; you will heal, wounds turned deep, and scars
From wounds and no more, and thus you will a woman be, or man
Or gender-free, the sullen flesh expanded into ecstasy
For you, for me, and ease will rule the stars.

From Pearl, My November Message To You:

When you have read this message, leave one of fraught presage.
When you have found common ground, fall soundlessly beneath the sedge.
O Starry Knight whose lance hath pricked the plain
Fond attribution once again.

Come home where lilacs rue the day
That found no pomp and circumstance held sway.
Leave such message that will presage upon this stage where thou wilt gauge
Fondly pearls fall in such numbers that swains and swills wake from their
Slumbers
Daunt well, gaunt knight. 
A single signal drop of blood upon the bracelet blood and borne.

Come dance with me, flaunt ruffled sleeves, across in France, the Maiden
Grieves. She takes to arms, she hurtles spear; the knight hath fall'n,
Rude night is near.

Partake, wayfarer, stop and sup; the sun is down, the moon is up.
Welcome, talk, stay and say a pace; love hath won Love's steady race.

Weave what thou canst now speak; speak when thread hath sundered.
