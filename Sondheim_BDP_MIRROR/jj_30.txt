Jet and Lag


From west to east, jetlag increases its attack on the body as time com-
presses and finally disappears altogether. It disappears as lather; the
body remains suspended between night and day. I continually check on
Perth-time, Sydney-time; they're no longer "natural." East to west, New-
York-time remained evident and subsumed, easily calculated and absorbed.
Expansion of time across days appears easier for the body to mediate.

Compression or expansion applies to internal time consciousness, those
Husserlian diagrams loosening or binding in a way he could hardly have
predicted. The breathing _substances_ time; this is the ontology of the
disappearing lather, held and suspended in phenomenologies of insomnia 
and defuge (Levinas for example). 

Exhausted, I rise and fall in waves, lying diagonally across the bed in 
space artificially heated to 28 C. Naked in 25 F winter weather, I twist
as seasons cross bodies, float them in spaces-interstices; Net-like, I
move among them, transformed as substance floats free. For a split-second
I pass (like water, feces) the image of a falling arch. The night closes
in, "various."

Sleep produces nothing, emptiness; I crawl back and forth within the Nets
which know no occasions. They're cylindrical, helical-hyperboloid, inter-
meshed, dog-legged. I've conquered what will kill me. The image drowns.
