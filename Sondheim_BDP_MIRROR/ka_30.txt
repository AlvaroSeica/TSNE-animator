approaching departure, beginning
to hold my breath, you see me flying over pacific ocean
you see me fire-star, scarred cloud cover,
WOUND GOD! KILL ALL ANGELIC FORCES!
fly on their feathers-settled-in, you know
all bridges are transparent-lateral-glass
THERE ARE STICKS ON THE GROUND!
hurtled towards hurt incandescent air, there
in or upon longitude-speed-of-speech, 
I AM PERFECT HUMAN above you, CRUSH-OF-ANGELS!
ICARUS-JULU! who hasn't got space for this
i haven't got space for this for this for this:
breathing, HURTLING, this isn't a poem, 
isn't a wreck, frontier REPORT
where air gets sucked outside of any weather
I AM GOD! I AM ANGELIC FORCES!
I WILL FLY ALL LAND AND ALL AIR!
WE WILL FLY TOGETHER ALWAYS IN-BETWEEN!
I WILL DESTROY ALL LAND AND ALL AIR!
EXPLODE WITH PERFECT ENERGY!
/at the airport, a scene!
/at the airport, broken plate-glass-barriers!
/at the airport, WE ASCEND!
/at the airport, BURN ALL PLANES!
/at the airport, DESTROY!
RISE! you will see a perfect star!
RISE! you will see a perfect dance!
You will see the dance of HUNGER GONE!
You will see the dance of THIRST FULFILLED!
You will see the dance and madness of the Insomniac!
You will see the dance of lust and devolution!
"to hold my breath, you see my flying over":

LAND CAN'T HOLD IT; YOU CAN!
