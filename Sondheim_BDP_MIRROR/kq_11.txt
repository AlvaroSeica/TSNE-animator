but I meant it
but she meant it
but they meant it
because it was easy for them to say
because they were speaking from the hearts
because nanotech s/ms sprung like bees from the clover into the
   of the clay - into the heart of the matrix
because the eight forbidden words were an excuse for the truth
because the seven forbidden words were named for the days of the week
because there are five vowels of truth and there are twenty-one
   consonants of lies
the vowels are of truth because the vowels are breathed from the body
the consonants are of lies because they hold the breath back
restrain the breath
stop the hands from clenching, fingers from spreading wide
because they sieve the vowels
but they meant it
but she meant it
but she meant it with her whole heart and very soul
s/ms in the eyes and hands
s/ms in the fingers and ears
hearing the consonants trying to get through trying to gettt through
consonants are s/ms - consonants are linkages couplings
she knew they thought vowels linked and coupled
vowels breathed
breathed blood - distension and fissure
the vowels paid no attention to the vowels
paid no attention - too busy with the body
blood and sacrifice of the body - s/m incisions
cuts - scars - wounds - breakthrough - consonant inscription - 
consonants run rampant
but she meant it - the way they ran rampant
busy with meaning - way they made meaning
she meant to make it run
