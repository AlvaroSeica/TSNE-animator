What impending death of oneself or another may construct:


i

One assumes in the absence of danger, disease, the extremities of life,
that one's project may continue indefinitely; thus writing tends in this
fashion towards a normative foreclosure, drawn by the exigencies and es-
thetics of apparent internal necessity. Impending collapse produces an/
other approach: that a project is only a process which may, like a diary
for example, be cut off arbitrarily at any point. Writing in these con-
ditions is a writing through urgency and emergency; it is writing that
attempts, in every phrase or sentence or paragraph, a recuperation and
resonance - as if the phrase or sentence or paragraph will be the last.

In this fashion, after time/ after time, it becomes apparent that there
is, of course, no last, not even with the excision or exclusion of life
-- that one's project is always already open-ended and on the verge of
failure. This recognition re-enters the project, restructures it from
within, so that the manifesto, for example, transforms into meaningless
phrases, self-doubts and critiques -- and all those other states that
some say characterize wisdom.

Of wisdom I know nothing, and of truth, less. I do know that impending
death, of oneself, or of someone so close that one is rubbed raw through
it, has the ability to transform text into fragile self-reflective flow;
object into discourse, a never-ending conversation full of glances, ex-
postulation and pauses; and foundations into an uneasy grasp of such,
the world slipping through one's fingers, the sky always already threat-
ening, close to disappearance beneath an angry, raging, dying, sun.

When the thing becomes a catheter
When being becomes a sponge
When beings become intravenous
When nothingness becomes a scan
When the void becomes radiation
When the I becomes chemotherapy
When entities become medication
When objects become neurasthenias
When selves become schizophrenias
When death becomes thing, being, beings
When death becomes nothingness, void, I
When death becoes entities, objects, selves
When death becomes thing, being, beings, nothingness, void, I, entities,
objects, selves
