CHURNMONSTER is a "broken or dirty text," modified by a program I wrote; 
the program asks questions, mixes and combines and reorganizes the 
answers. The result is a combination of what I am or might be trying to 
say, and code interference, which rises to the surface, for example, "And 
it has taken you just 5.200 minutes to make a monster!" which simply 
documents the amount of time it took to enter the text. I can't judge this 
in terms of traditional literature; I can say, however, that what is 
produced is almost always a surprise - something that comes from partially 
externalized, partially internalized structure.
