What I'd say if I had tongue to speak:


I'd say yes, the hands bleed in cyberspace, pools of everything on the
keyboards - hopes, warfares, ammunitions and remissions. I'd say we're all
blind _here_ or deaf _here_ - that we're all groping in the dark, to find
our way through to the virtual light. 

This is absurd; blindness and deafness have nothing to do with this space,
and to consider them in regard to it is to play into the hands, feet, head
of prejudice, the politics of deafness for example, the enunciation of
sign language, the problematics of the verbal sphere.

Mouths open up speech balloons in any medium, format; stigmata occur be-
cause we're overwhelmed with the passion of part-objects - holes in the
hands, feet, and head. 

A hole is cyberspace "is-when-you" stop speaking, writing, staring, JUST
FOR A MINUTE - that's a hole! And a whole is _any_ address, protocol, re-
cognition you bring to your JUST-CAUSE, JUST-CAUSE-FIRST-CAUSE!

We're stigmatized here. We don't belong here. We belong in the open air. 
We're led by boy-girls girl-boys. We're led by greed, capital-flux, capi-
tal-shit draining the last remnants of air out of cyberspace. We're led by
64-bit graphics gone all the way 2^n out to infinite rows of Jasper's ci-
phers. & Older & Younger Will Dance The Strathspey!

Hands, feet, and head, we're bound. We've taken up the cross: We're taken
up to it: It's easy VRML! We're dripping like crazy. Plug the leak in
finger; finger the dike. The signifier's just-so. O holy Mary. O so sew
so sewn shut. From O to NULL: from O to NULL: Rain in!
