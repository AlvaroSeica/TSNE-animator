Parable of the Goats, the Princess, and the Wise Man


I, Daishin Nikuko, attended an elegant dinner this very evening. And
during the course of this dinner, I, Daishin Nikuko, came to speak of
parables and of the nature of parable writing. And I did declare, that,
in fact, it was only a matter of choosing, for example, a princess, two
goats, and a wise man, and the parable would form itself around them,
just as if nature herself were telling the tale. And that this was a
way of vacating the premises of truth, while citing such from the dis-
tance of the word. And this is the parable that has come into being, my
mind, and yours, the parable of the goats, the princess, and the wise
man.
