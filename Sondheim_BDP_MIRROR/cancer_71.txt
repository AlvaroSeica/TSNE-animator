unclearness of writing


the text is unclear (that I have written an unclear text; that I don't
understand the text I have written; that the text which has written itself
through me is unclear; that these reasons and motivations, results and
phenomenologies, are unclear); that the text is blurred, confused; that
the text is unreadable; that the letters themselves are unreadable; that
the lines are askew; that the referents are unknown or peculiar; that the
referents are one-to-many; that the text is far too abstract; that it
references things, persons, or events totally obscure (that I have gone
into hiding; that I am uncertain of my meaning; that I am drawn to the
unknown or obscure; that my thinking itself is askew; that I employ un-
clear writing as a defense or strategy; that I am asserting something I do
not seem to be asserting; that my real intent and content are elsewhere);
that it goes elsewhere; that it goes without saying
