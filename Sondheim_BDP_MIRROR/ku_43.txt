	 		   compiling you
				  
       inside, tongues call helplessly across time and space,
	 against the brittle specific orders of the bones -
     bones separate tongues one from another, carry them away,
		ripples and surfaces on the tongues.
      the bones meander and comply. the bones move and carry,
	 devour to the bone, bones touching and caressing.
       tangled inside and thoroughly, tongues call helplessly
	     across time and space, against the brittle
		   specific orders of the bones!
