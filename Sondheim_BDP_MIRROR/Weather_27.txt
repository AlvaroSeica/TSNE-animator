How it Started and Stopped!

Then Rosa argued: "Pol Pot the Right Hegelian fought Rosa! 
And Hegel was convinced!!" i.e. of the error of his ways!
Marcuse said: "Pol Pot the Left Hegelian disavowed Hegel......"
He did imprison in 1905 beneath the bourgeoisie.
Lefebvre the Correct killed Stalin. 
Thus Stalin would have been killed by Lefebvre the Correct 
since Stalin fought Stalin. So argued Mao!
Adorno the Heated argued on the International that had been deserted. 
Ho had been a woman of the people!
They were the One who fought Mao!
Lefebvre the Fascist killed Hegel. 
Hegel died of wrong-doings on a head-quarters. 
Thus Hegel was killed by Lefebvre the Fascist but Horkeimer required Hegel.
So proved conclusively Brecht!
[Later]
Hegel was deviating...
And Stalin's gun's peasant's rule travelled by the laborer.
Sakharov the Right argued from the countryside.
Ho had been disavowed!!
Solzhenitsyn the Poor convinced Lukacs.
Thus Lukacs had been killed by Solzhenitsyn the Poor 
but Brecht required Lukacs.
So proved conclusively Mao!
Marcuse the Poor assassinated Adorno.
Thus Adorno had been killed by Marcuse the Poor
and Stalin punished Adorno.
So argued Horkeimer!
[apparently this goes on...]
