s/ms: The Argument


Communication is the mutual orienting of consensual domains, providing
consensuality is problematized. This orienting is in the form of linkages
and couplings. Think of a linkage as [A][B] where A' implies [A'][B'] and
think of coupling as [AB] where A' implies [A'B]. Orientings are composed
of s/ms, part-objects which might be related to sado-masochisms in which
tension and control, a political economy, appear.

Orientings cross party lines, wrack across epistemes, transgress ontolo-
gies; there's the real-virtual, the virtual-real, there are real and
virtual particles, interweavings, interpenetrations - not to mention the
ontic regions of mathematics, psychoanalytical entities, applications and
protocols.

It's all constitutings where one might conceive of orientings as meaning
and entity generators as well. (It's all anything you want it to _be,_
said Jennifer, which is just about _saying_ anything you want it to
_mean._ And left it at that.)
