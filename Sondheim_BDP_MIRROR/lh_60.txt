all this traffic backwards and forwards /usr/bin/rz -vv -b -E 
shuttling packets with similar names /usr/bin/sz -vv -b zz
you might never know what you'll find /usr/bin/sz -vv -b en
it's a grid or raster, its cultural production /usr/bin/sz -vv -b ww
you can hear the sound of the shuttle /usr/bin/rz -vv -b -E 
operations are closely watched /usr/bin/sz -vv -b zz
control is all the way down to the singular bit /usr/bin/sz -vv -b zz
these things occur in place, following each other /usr/bin/sz -vv -b yy
they move cleanly, screaming network! network! /usr/bin/sz -vv -b ar
they move in absolute silence /usr/bin/sz -vv -b zz
perhaps the wires are slightly heated, charred /usr/bin/sz -vv -b yy
anything could be moving here, just anything /usr/bin/sz -vv -b zz
when i turn my neck i hear bones grating /usr/bin/sz -vv -b ba
