West Flemish Online (for A.)


"Unfortunately, all that survives from the earliest period of Old West Low
Franconian, beyond a great deal of onomastic material in Latin texts, is
the follwing remarkable West Flemish sentence of the eleventh century,
found in England in the binding of a Latin Manuscript:

hebban olla vogala nestas hagunnan hinase hi(c) (e)nda thu w(at) (u)nbidan
(w)e nu
'all the birds have begun nests except for you and me--what are we waiting
for?'"

manic Languages, Orrin W. Robinson.)
