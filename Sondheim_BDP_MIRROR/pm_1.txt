second life third life

begin by setting out directions, these are the five healthy directions, 
the middle direction is one of exhaustion and ecstasy, then in the 
direction opposite the middle direction set out the last direction, which 
is one of wounding and suffering. if the middle direction is reception, 
the last direction is penetration, if the last direction is reception, the 
middle direction is penetration. set the house in order from the middle 
direction outward, these are the spokes which narrow to the point of 
intersection between the middle direction and last direction. now forget 
the four directions, concentrate on the spokes, the point, the middle and 
the last direction. then concentrate on the spokes, forget the point, the 
middle and the last direction, the spokes come close to the point, forever 
close to the point, but the point is absent, emptiness, emptiness radiates 
outward between the spokes. now forget the spokes, emptiness radiates 
among the ghosts of them, the spokes are hungry ghosts, they gnaw at 
emptiness, they are wounded, they are defeated, they disappear. now think 
of emptiness, think of nothing else, think of nothing. now you have laid 
out the house and the world and the word, but you are in ignorance, you do 
not know house or world or word, if you think house or world or word you 
must begin again, laying out the five directions and so forth. now you 
have come to an end and you are ready to begin, you have come to the 
beginning, and you are ready to end. now continue.

you must imagine now yourself and house and world and word annihilated, 
you must imagine annihilation of annihilation. you must imagine almost all 
pleasure, among taste of delight and touch of exaltation, and among scent 
of numinous being and sight of untold beauty and hearing of harmonious 
sounds. now you must imagine another being joined to yourself and house 
and world and word, you must imagine penetration reception and reception 
penetration, you must imagine fullness and overflowing of delight. now you 
will find you are creating and you are making sheave-woman and sheave-man, 
you are sheave-woman and sheave-man, you have sheave-sight-and-sound, you 
have sheave-touch-and-scent, you have sheave-taste-and-mind, you have 
sheave-passion and sheave-ecstasy. now you will walk and remember, you 
will remember everything, and you will speak and hear, see and taste, you 
will forbid nothing, you will not be forbidden, you will rise above and 
sink below, you will be among the direction of wounded and suffering. now 
you will do this for a long time, for aeons.

now you will embrace emptiness, you are making sheave-other, you are 
making sheave-emptiness, you are making wrath, are making creation, are 
making annihilation. now you are making annihilation, now you are among 
them, beneath them, above them, now you are beyond them. now you are no 
longer imagining, you are no longer thinking among them, you are no longer 
thinking, no longer sheave, no longer thought, now you are annihilation, 
now you are making nothing, now you are annihilation, now you destroy 
house and world and word, now you are destroyed, now you are annihilation, 
you are free, you are emptiness, you are annihilation, you are emptiness, 
now you are free.

almost a sonnet -

Azure wakes up in the middle of the night, she says
she says, well I say, I'm getting up here in Denver,
there might be coyotes - I say, are you awake, feeling
a bit moronic with the possibility of an 'of course' -
she replies you have to get out of the way - I say, of
what - of the man with the cart - what man - the man
with the cart - I look, we're in a small room, surely,
if there were a man with a cart, I'd see him - well he
was behind the cart - but still - I look around, she's
awake now - I say where did he come from - she says
she says, from the closet - she says from the closet -
I can't sleep, it's 3am or 4am - I say, I'm getting up,
I rise like the dark sun of her dreams - she's sleeping
again, I dress in the dark, look out the window - no
coyotes to be seen, no man, no cart, no me, I walk down 
the hall, open the laptop, write this, almost a sonnet -

Derivation of "Bug," telegraphy code, etc.


"Bug" has been traced vis-a-vis computer folklore to early programming/ 
hardware/software/etc. as far back as the 1950s I believe. But recently 
I've come across a much earlier source. In The Telegraph Instructor, 4th 
and revised edition, 1908, G.M. Dodge gives a list of telegraph terms.

"Bug-in-the-wire -- A slang phrase frequently used when a wire is in 
trouble."

This relates to "buggy," "he's bugged," "stop bugging me," and so forth; 
what's interesting is the noun related to communications technology. In 
relation to computers, this might be a case of convergent evolution, but 
it's more likely to have moved through telegraphy - telephony - radio - 
and so forth, into the habitus of information theory and cybernetics.

Another early term relates to the origins of "ham" in "ham radio" - 
although the exact source of this remains unknown:

"'Ham' or 'Plug' -- A telegraph operator, who is not proficient."

[A number of phrases we take for granted are older than they appear. For 
example, "so long"; from A. Wallace, Popular Sayings Dissected, 1895: "So 
long! a leave-taking, a piece of colonial terseness is equivalent to 'au 
revoir, saluons!' of which latter word it may be a direct corruption, or 
again of 'salaam,' a bow, or 'salem,' 'peace be with you.' The phrase may 
be paraphrased into 'Goodbye, so long as we do not meet.'"]

On another related topic, early Morse code was somewhat different; there 
were all sorts of variations - Navy Codes, European Codes, Morse American 
codes, etc. The same book gives for example, "The Morse code of signals as 
applied to the telegraph is used exclusively in the United States." The 
code as given has three dash-lengths; for example,

t is - 
but 
l is -- 
and 
0 is ---- 
In addition, 
c is .. . 
that is, some letters have small breaks within them; while 
i is ..
o is . . 
and 
y is .. .. 
and Further, there are some longer strings; ending parentheses
) is .....  .. ..
and
capitalized letters are indicated by .. . .-..
- so it goes. (Oddly this has been difficult to type, since I wanted to 
eliminate meta/diacritical marks which might have been taken as part of 
the code itself!)

The actual telegraph (semantic) code on top of the Morse results in 
messages such as

Wr r ty gg r 9
or
Es r ty cn
and addresses/headers can read as obscurely as
Hr tru pink No 38 VO HW "HX" ck 12 collect N P R

The code, like international signals codes, is heuristic, ideographic, and 
was simply memorized by the telegraph operator. It was just as complicated 
for railroad telegraphy, where the difference between 19 and 31 - both 
meaning "train order" - was complex. 

Note that this is triple-coding - Morse to telegraphic code to ordinary 
language, and that, while natural language is fond of redundancy (re: 
Shannon/Weaver), telegraphy is dominated by economic considerations. 
Thus word counts, and what constitutes a word, are critical. For example:

Van Dorne - 1 word
Queen Anne County - 3 words
44.12 - 5 words
No. 185 22nd St - 8 words
North Carolina - 1 word
10 000 000 - 8 words
and so forth.

The telegraph operator also had to understand railroad Engine Steam 
Whistle Signals; here are a few (o - short sound and --- long sound):

o Stop. Apply breaks.
--- --- Release Breaks.
--- o o o Flagman go back and protect rear of train.
--- --- --- --- Flagman return from west or south.
--- --- --- --- --- Flagman return from east or north.
--- --- --- When running, train parted; to be repeated until answered.
o o Answer to any signal not otherwise provided for.
--- --- o o Approaching public crossings at grade.
o o o o Call for signals.

Air whistles are different, as are torpedo signals, light signals, 
semaphore, etc.

Service Message Code:

N S N - No such number.
G B A - Give better address.
G S A - Give some address.
DFS - Disregard former service.
92 - Deliver.
Deld (or) 92d - Delivered.

There is also Phillips Press Code - an example:

"A dsx rain es wind storm psd tru t nt end o ta county tsm dsyg a gt deal 
o prpy, roofs wr bln off a no o sma blgs es nux trees wr uprtd. A barn 
blng to James Sampson ws stru by lghtg kig 3 horses es burng svl tons o 
hay stored trin." This is standardized, but formed, it seems, primarily by 
the elimination of redundancy. The header for the same example, however, 
is another thing:

"o
Hr tru No 39 VO HW "HX" ck 63 collect N P R"
and so forth.

to go to Yahoo. I&#39;m curious about the full header - we&#39;ll see. 
I&#39;ve not been able to use telnet or get out of the proprietary

into the issue of ecoterrorism the patriot act de curity agree that 
ecoterrorism is a severe problem naming the se i am not a big fan of sony 
but if they piss off the ecoterrorism group known as peta they 
slaughtering animals is just a testament to mans brutality it condemns and 
deplores ecoterrorism and other violence in the name of we are concerned 
about the northern bush meat trade ie the slaughter for tammuz god of

Boojum


Our cat, Boojum, had to be put to sleep today, in our arms, two days after 
her 18th birthday. We were closer to her than most people. She meditated. 
She taught patience. We're distraught; she was a good friend, a companion 
who helped us through bleak times. She loved olives, asparagus, tomato 
sauce. She was beginning to close down; her last purring was about ten 
days ago. Losing a companion (Haraway's companion species) is as bad a 
loss as any other (in spite of my father, who said, It's not like losing a 
person you know). I can't do elegy after days of crying, running to emer- 
gency rooms, trying different foods and medication. Below is her Internet 
Index, within the crabbed space of my webpage.

Boojum Carter (medical report four years ago)


feline, aged 13 1/2, four years after our mother's death, biopsy diagnosed
as follows:

Microscopic: MAMMARY MASS ONE - This mass is demarcated and has a well
localized appearance. It is comprised of a collection of neoplastic
epithelial cells that are forming tubules. The tubules are separated by
variably thick connective tissue septa. The neoplastic cells have ovoid
stippled nuclei and a scant amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic
borders are distinct. The mitotic rate is low and ranges from 0-1 per
high-power field. Nonneoplastic tissue is forming margins. There are
scattered aggregates of lymphocytes and plasma cells surrounding the
growth MAMMARY MASS TWO - This is the larger of the growths evaluated.  
There are several large cysts. There is a proliferating population of
neoplastic epithelial cells. The cells are organized in the lobules that
are forming occasional tubules. The central areas of the lobules are
degenerate. Neoplastic cells exhibit invasion. One or two layers of cells
line the tubules. The cells have large round vesicular nuclei with
multiple nucleoli. The cytoplasm is eosinophilic, scant and cytoplasmic
borders are distinct. The mitotic rate ranges up to six per high-power
field. Nonneoplastic tissue is forming margins.

DIAGNOSIS: MAMMARY MASS ONE- MAMMARY GLAD ADENOCARCINOMA, TUBULAR, LOW
GRADE MAMMARY MASS TWO - MAMMARY GLAND ADENOCARCINOMA, TUBULAR CYSTIC

PROGNOSIS: Guarded

COMMENTS: Feline mammary malignancies should be considered capable of
metastasis and warrant a guarded prognosis at best. The first smaller
growth evaluated is well localized and is not exhibiting invasion. This
appears to be a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. The second growth is
exhibiting invasion and this growth should be considered as having
potential for metastasis. Lymphatic invasion is not identified with any of
the sections evaluated. These growths appear to be excised.

Comments by doctor: Guarded. Felines tend not to recover. She might live
six months, several years, or less. There is no way to tell. She needs
immune system fortification. The doctor wishes her news would have been
better. The question is whether or not the tubules remain within the body.  
The cancer could spread rapidly or even go into remission.

Comments by writer: Boojum is named after the Boojum tree in Baja
California. She is thirteen and a half. She exhibits no signs of illness.  
She has been my companion and is highly sociable and nervous, She has the
personality, if not the skills, of a brilliant writer. At the moment she
is sleeping, recovering from the removal of her stitches. She travelled
with us to Miami, where she encountered, even indoors, new and interesting
forms of flora and fauna. Azure and I pray that she will live forever.

Comments: That cancer is always the same, disordered, disorderly, a tough
go whose treatment is violent and invasive as well. The well-defined
structure of the body begins to collapse as tunnels are formed through
highly-organized tissue.

Every organism is a world of miracles, and every creature dissolves in the
fury of cancer and creation. Azure and I are beside ourselves, and Boojum
Carter dreams now, not of death.





elegy for Boojum, our companion cat, we are all poor,


'i can't do elegy' -
this is a poor and sleepless poem -
when something's at the limit there's nothing more to say -
for a moment i might have reversed the process
but heard nothing more than wailing or sounds like an animal -
nothing of crying, just tattered sound -
nothing of warning, fear, existence, trepidation -
nothing can be said on either side of death -
neither this one nor that one -
neither this nor the other -
death is an other -
(eighteen years, and death is an other) -
death is everywhere, death is not around -
(eighteen years, and death is everywhere,
death is poor, death is not around) -
always already other can't speak can't hear can't see -
double needles, of sedative, of anesthetic overdose -
doubled needles -
who are these people & their kindness -
(eighteen years and the kindness of strangers) -
i'm done with it, the other's never done with it -
always the last trip last day last night
last meal last touch last scent last sound -
(eighteen years and the last day and night,
last touch and meal, last scent and sound) -
in and out of the thick of it -
the thick of it never changed -
it stayed dry, viscous, substance and fissure -
it's uncomfortable, stains, sticks to everything -
lives on in us, exchanged, drops to the ground -
crawls out, walks to the sea, drops to the ground -
i can't drop to the ground, i drop to the ground -
there's an elegy on, everyone's there -
she says i think we're at the beginning of speech -
she says she's very sad and wants to go hone -
she stood dry, unattended -
(eighteen years and dry and unattended,
accompanied and unaccompanied, who can go 
into and out of the world) -
the fire went out, into the world --
today someone counted elements,
earth, fire, water, wind, air, heat, dearth, 
wood, & metal -
(eighteen years and the counting of elements) -
how was the air, the air was cold, bitter,
the wind harsh, we turned the carrier against 
the wind, dearth of it all, harboring a flame
until the last, dying in our arms, the metal table,
off to a far wood of hunting -
the world is filled with secret coordinates -
impermanence of the metallic -
she says she thought of the limit -
in a small heaven somewhere -
& now we are silent in the night, existence is silent -
existence crawls, we heard her cries, the catheter
carefully inserted elsewhere in the building -
we held her heat against us, we exchanged heat -
the tablets - prayer wheel spinning above a slow flame -
we couldn't bear to empty her water, clean
her bowl of food, now despair reigns, & in our arms
nothing happened, everything seized --
'this is a poor and sleepless poem' -
without goodbyes, with ill-knowledge,
with infinite regret, with the world undone -
(eighteen years and the world undone) -
ah ah ah ah
ah ah ah ah
ah ah ah ah
ah ah ah ah



intolerable.


always, I thought, intolerable.
I cried intolerable, it was a sound.
it is intolerable to decide for or against death.
if I leave a house, I may or may not return.
things may not return exactly, but most often they may return.
death is intolerable. death does not return.
I may decide, I will harbor this animal, this person, this cause.
caring, giving, are implicated; sympathy, and perhaps empathy.
this is a tending, not a shepherding or stewardship.
or a mutual tending, shepherding, stewardship.
this is a continuity, this is constant.
the decision for death is instantaneous at the moment of death.
it is intolerable to make these decisions.
a decision for life may be revoked.
then, again, at the moment of death, implying already decided.
or that action or performative accompanying.
I saw the sedative administered, needle and catheter.
even then, I could have stayed that other, harboring the moment.
I went through with it into eternal darkness.
surely Boojum did not suffer, just as surely she wanted to live.
I made a decision, for her, and against her living.
for in the theater of steel, she resisted everything and strongly.
she defended herself, lovingly as usual, her claws withdrawn,
her mind full, commodious, insistent.
she defended herself, death was the last thing on her mind.
and we held her and tried to comfort her, she growled slowly,
and then lay down and then not at all.
it is intolerable to make these decisions!
one should kill oneself after such decisions! I am a coward!
one should not make these decisions!
for one universe has ended and why should another continue?
WHY?

 



re\play


this replay of abjection
is the playing-out of infection
beneath the aegis of dejection
somewhat tantric rejection
resulting from subjection
swallowed from projection
beyond a form's bijection
operated through surjection

useless wireless trope
against a brainless dope
darkling in a mope
there's nothing left of hope
impossible to cope
headless figures grope
tangled in a rope
crawling down a slope
they're given too much scope
elephants in a bathtub one says to the other please pass the soap
the other says no soap radio kind of introjection

Requiem


requiem for Boojum, about 13 minutes

If the left and right hands have independent repeated patterns prime to 
each other, why then the cycle is right*left by which time, or a fraction 
of time indicated by attention span (based on short-term memory and 
defuge), right*left/[short-term memory, defuge], I have moved on (to 
another register, tonality, movement or moment of sound), listener follow- 
ing (if the listener is listening yet), so that the ride is imminent (in a 
distant sense related to 1/1 jazz rhythm or tabla additive combinatorics) 
or a moment of consciousness (moment in the sense of internal time con-
sciousness mitigated by short-term memory or long-term memory of other 
times and other musics by this selfing or other selvings) which at the end 
(as if the requiem is in withdrawal or unknowingly bracketed until the 
unexpected finality which returns as 'perfect sense') seems natural and 
sadly required, as such is required, drawn forth, by any organism, from 
small cat to whale, not a rupture or a ripple by a human, or at the least, 
this human, playing this guitar, a 1949 di Giorgio, in an act of homage 
hardly if ever unheard.     http://www.alansondheim.org/bbj.mp3



success at last, just for a moment

it has been a difficult few days in the virtual environments laboratory. 
we moved most of the motion capture equipment to 109 to use, but couldn't 
locate the bvh computer (which receives signals from an old 486 used with 
proprietary hardware). the explanations written by the interns were miss- 
ing as well. we knew the bvh machine had to be around. we found an old 
dell and gary put windows 2000 on that, getting the key from another mach- 
ine. we put bvh software on the old dell, but the signals from the 486, 
which, it turned out, had to go through a router since we had no crossover 
connectors, were crashing it. so we were back to square one. i figured if 
i could locate a photo of the old bvh computer we'd used years ago, we 
might be able to use it to match with one of the bunches of similar units 
in 302c. i looked through archive after archive, until i located it; the 
image was slightly blurred, but the layout of the masking tape label (un- 
readable in the image) on top of the machine allowed us to narrow poss- , 
ible candidates to two. we found we couldn't get into either without pass- 
words. i discovered a scrap of paper in a corner of the room, 302c, with a 
password on it; it worked. so now we set them both up and one of them, 
which had been used as a projector connection to a virtual wall, was it. 
we brought the machine down to 109 and it almost ran; at least the soft- 
ware didn't crash. i found changing the antenna parameters for the motion 
capture and moving from ascii to binary and from tcp to udp did the trick. 
gary set up the 5100 port and addresses and we produced slomo.bvh as he 
moved the sensors slowly around; i wanted to duplicate the speed of the 
5-7 frames per second output of the 486, instead of working high-speed as 
i usually do. we brought the bvh file to poser on a compaq laptop which 
for some reason is now permanently misconfigured but usable; the result is
http://www.alansondheim.org/slomo.mov which i quite quite like; if you 
ignore the hand fluttering, the movement is closer to what we need to work 
with at the moment. as far as the hand-fluttering is concerned, we're 
going to internally turn off the hand sensors by modifying the capture 
program, written in c, but with clear documentation; even a non-programmer 
like myself can get into it a bit. now to slow things down further so the 
inconceivable happens at the speed of amoeba-learning; in addition, to 
transform avatar into deity-emanent, following, introjecting yamantaka or 
one or another manifestation, moving mind and sheave-body into other 
realms far beyond 486, 2000, 109, 302c, 5-7, until what ever may appear in 
the future brought quickly back to earth.

Railroad Club


Images from open house, Morgantown model railroad club, embodying cuts 
from one scale to another, from human to true world, from mind to emanent. 
Who would call this the postmodern? One might locate something else here: 
not the cut but the suture, not disparity but deep memory; the locales 
represented, real and imaginary, conjure the West Virginia landscape of 
the 1950s, in the memory of many of the club members. What better than a 
photograph than a reconstruction in which everything is punctum, intended?

The photographs are of the text, of this text; they're weaker without it, 
they go elsewhere, I'm pulling them back in. I'm pulling them back in to 
indicate multiculturalisms and emphases on locale and habitus tend both 
suture and division (these people, these others) in favor of _listening_ 
and its phenomenology.

But listening is skew-orthogonal, again, to the _style_ of the images, 
based on any number of photographers and trajectories.

Now what do I see when I do not know what I see? Certainly aspects and 
entities are present within the true world filtered through the history of 
photography and photographers who have no responsibility for me.

Where are the passengers in this life? Where are the passengers in the 
life of the other?

You can already feel the economy of the land, extractive industries, pov- 
erty, environmental pollution, mountain-topping, strip-mining, deep-min-
ing, feed stores, small towns in the hollows, grey dust, what's worn is 
worn, what's not is brought into play through deep memory's suture which 
even bends, transfigures the landscape, someday we'll all rise to the 
surface.

I will live forever
I will live forever
I will live forever
As a hungry ghost
As a hungry ghost
I will live forever

I don't remember the exact name of the railroad club or the members. Some- 
one named Mike, I believe, made the larger mine model. I came in as a 
tourist finding nameless things. the models were both outstanding, depres- 
sing to an outsider. The images appeared as images, imaginary, with what- 
ever context I might bring from the outside; the social depth was absent. 
I turned to the jump-cut.

The jump-cut was of the visual, that disparity of mind and scale. Railroad 
switching systems were fundamental to the development of the Internet. 
Evidence of electronic skein was everywhere. Jump-cut sutured into dream- 
scape, dream-screen, displacement/condensation semiotics. What is of truth 
or tending towards the indexical in the images applies as well to the vis- 
ual in general, compounding of memory, suture, cut, surface. Whatever one 
sees is surface, surface-only; x-rays report on deeper surfaces, 
translucent or transparent to invisible light.

The photographs bother me, as if theory needed image-propping beyond the 
diagrammatic. But what can the image hold, if not an arrangement that 
might be constituted as evidence? If a diagram is indexical or symbolic, 
the photograph resides elsewhere; evidence stands for nothing and hardly 
represents itself, nor is it pointing towards something across ontological 
or epistemological lines. On this level the photograph simply reports as 
Bazin might have it, on what-is, or rather the what-is and thetic con- 
strues within the dialog of image production. In any case, the postmodern 
is left behind, or rather, is relegated to analyses of socio-economic 
phenomena where the theory works wonders; think of postmodern geography, 
Harvey or Roja for example.

What would postmodern geography make of mountain-topping? And then its 
representation which makes the wrecked landscape somehow graspable, 
something to walk around, replant with meadow or pasture?

I think of tantra, mandala, Jefferey Hopkins' introduction to the Kala- 
chakra Tantra (Kalachakra Tantra, Rite of Initiation, Dali Lama, 1999). 
Hopkins walks/writes the body of the reader through the mandala ("Notice 
the entryway at the eastern door, wider than the doorway, with a three 
storied portico above the entranceway. Each of the stories of the portico 
above the entryway has four pillars across the front, thereby creating 
three room-like alcoves on each story. In each of these eight alcoves are 
goddesses of offering; the middle alcove in the first story on the eastern 
side has a black wheel of doctrine with a buck and doe to the right and 
left." And so forth.) Now think of the Morgantown railroad club images in 
the same or different shimmer, think not of the imminent/immanent identi- 
fication of entities within them, but of paths through or around or by 
virtue of these entities, which themselves are processes (one doesn't live 
forever, the tracks are constantly changing). Is there a meditation here, 
emission or spew that is sourceless except for (in spite of) the corners 
or frame of the image? Can one imagine a habitus, inhabitation? Is there a 
seeing that moves through memory near and far without the supplication of 
the signifier? This is what literally remains to be seen, and brings the 
essay to its clothes.

Anti-Crystal


Crystal radio apparatus set up in Morgantown, with main inductor coil of 
the honeycomb type. A diode and air-capacitor were used; these three 
elements constituted the original radio, with the exception of the diode. 
The antenna was coupled with a variometer and second air-capacitor, both 
old. The antenna was 90 feet long-wire wrapped around two sides of a house 
in a hollow. Reception on 1300 from a local station was so dominant that I 
attempted at all costs to avoid it, bringing hum and background into play, 
with mixed results. The whole was fed into a sound editing program for 
further modification. I attempted a democratization of the airwaves, 
allowing the power grid and other interferences their say. The result is 
at http://www.alansondheim.org/mg1.mov which is a nice sound in a way, 
sculpted to be of sufficient interest in itself. This sculpting, like 
other aesthetic decisions, interfered with the original intent, but I do 
believe such interference constitutes the history of much recent art, if 
not certain schools of somewhat machinic poetics. For what is present must 
be presence, if presented, there must be a force behind it driving the 
efflorescence, there must be intention behind that force or a reading of 
that intention, there must be a consciousness behind that reading, there 
must be mind behind that consciousness, there must be confluence beyond 
that. What is here is confluence, for your listening and your listening 
pleasure.

'In every experience of every objective 'This' by every experiencer the 
female differentiating function is necessary, but so too is the male seed 
of unity, which supplies 'Being' from the side of the subject, the unitary 
consciousness of self from the side of the experiencer.' (Rawson)

'Why are so many boys and girls not erect? Look in almost any school and 
you see that many of the pupils, whether sitting or standing, are never 
straight. Heads are forward; shoulders double over a little, sometimes a 
good deal; chests incline to droop, and grow flat. Fine, full chests, and 
an easy, graceful carriage, are rare.

As the pupils get older, these faults, instead of going away, grow worse.

Can this be helped? Is there any way to make a crooked boy or girl 
straight? Take a slim, angular boy, for instance, whose father is round- 
shoulded and flat-chested--and perhaps his mother, too: can he become 
straight, like a soldier?' (Blaikie)

'The same [entity] does not arise from [itself], and how can it arise from 
another? Neither does it arise from both [itself and another], and what 
exists without any cause?' (Candrakirti, trans. Huntington)

'The singularity of specular reflections is demonstrated by the fact that 
if one tries to apply to them the schema of a communicational process mamy 
puzzling conclusions arise: source and addressee coincide (at least in 
cases where a human being looks at him or herself in the mirror), receiver 
and transmitter coincide; expression and content coincide since the 
content of the reflected image is just the image of a body, not the body 
itself; as a matter of fact the referent of a mirror image is pure visual 
matter.' (Eco)

The Beautiful Throbbed Emanentation


The following is a culmination of certain directions associated with mo- 
tion capture - in particular, operating too near and too far from the 
receiving antenna, with mixed sensors. In both positions, the configur- 
ation generates furious behavior as clusters of sensors shoot to ragged 
infinities and back again. Heads may detach and the cartoon integrity 
returns as such. The reading, however, is different, as is the jectivity; 
the reading is external, jectivity internal. The reading searches for 
coherency: which body belongs with which organ? Jectivity follows organ, 
head, and limb paths, identification with approaching, consummating, 
withdrawing, churning. This is Brownian motion, but radically integral. 

So what is being modeled? For one thing, slow-simple movement, carefully 
seducing, caressing, antenna and sensor alike. For another, electronic 
jitters which threaten to break apart the world. 

(This is some of the most advanced video/mocap work I've done; I'm always
amazed that both beauty and wonder can come out of such poverty. It's the
machines which are talking, which are rubbing against one another, which
parlay communication into visionary ekstasis. I must learn, I continue to
learn, how to listen, how to see, what is proffered, what is not within my
powers of conjuration. Magic is magic because it always come from the
Other. I have lost expectation.)

Violence, abjection, arousal, caress, tumescence, thickening, cutting of 
the sheaves. Sheave-figures which I am sure will soon be independent of 
our desire or construct.

Abjection is the most difficult. How to dis/comfort and fetishize, hold 
and release simultaneously. These emanants do this naturally, as Azure 
Carter, original model, follows suit.

Abjection is the most difficult, less so as the camera moves in, cuts
through sheaves. For the viewer there is the level of the subterranean bvh
code in dialog with the exigencies of Poser models, but there are also
levels of organs and affect, and it is the breasts and hands, high-speed
maternal display, that provide tremulous scaffolding:
