Why they can't have their freedom without taking it out on others as part 
of this human family.

Why they have to move in on the others in the hills moving in back on 
them sweeping over the same plains more often than not:

"'!Nemi Zapata! !Nemi Zapata! Nian ca namotata; ayemo miqui. !Nemi
Zapata!'" 

"'Zapata is alive! Zapata is alive! Your father is here. He is not dead! 
Zapata is alive!'"
[...]
"The Zapatistas and Carrancistas met in the middle of the wilderness. And 
there they killed one another."
[...]
"And one day the men of Carranza dragged the men from their houses - the 
fifteen-year-old boys, those of twelve or thirteen, the old, the young, 
the strong - and they killed them all in the village square before the 
church."
[...]
"Pigs and dogs fed upon the dead."
[...]
"For a while day, neither the men of Carranza or Zapata moved. They per- 
mitted the dead to be buried."
[...]
"Then in the month of July the Carrancistas came again. They came to turn 
us out. They said, 'You will have to leave your homes soon. And if you 
refuse to leave, that means that you are on the side of Zapata. Then our 
men will come to kill you!'"
[...]
"Before our return, our homes had been scattered, apart from each other, 
and the inhabitants were always frightened by cries of 'The Zapatistas 
are coming!' or 'The Carrancistas are coming!' But those days are gone."
[...]

"Achtocopa zan huehueca caltin oyeya, ihuan otlamamauhtiloaya ica occepa. 
'!Ye huitze _zapatistas_!' nozo '!Ye huitze carrancistas!' Yotlan."

Which is why they are always good or which is why they are always bad?
Why do people kill each other?
Why do people hate each other?
Why do people kill each other < >?</ >
Why do people hate each other < >?</ >
Is the reason that there is more bad than good because people always die 
and that is a sign of bad but that people are always born is not always a 
sign of good?

Nian ca namotata; ayemo miqui.
