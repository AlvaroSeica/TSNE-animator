Hating You

The screen doesn't do it any longer; it's too thin, too formatted, too
much control; I can't smell you here; I can't smell you anywhere. I can't
fall in love with a wall of text; I can hate text, hate the feel of let-
ters, limited punctuation on the horizon of the body's breath. Comma coma
and your chest swells in and out; period, and you've reached the end of
thought. I don't know who I hate, but the spiked letters _do_ for a start.
