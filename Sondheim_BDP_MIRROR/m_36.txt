Streams of data that continue to circulate forever, forgotten fragments 
of programs buried in almost-inaccessible archives, slow-running solar 
machines continued half-buried in sand, dusk-machines, where tiffany and 
katherine, tiffany and emission are generated over and over again -

These moos, these muds, other environments, are the remnants of collapsed 
worlds and we can't consider this virtual space without them, archaeolog- 
ical remnants of past cultures already disappearing with the roar of the 
'superhighway' overhead -

Which is why I have been reconfiguring the Mud, meandering through the 
MOOs in a more-or-less nomadic fashion, writing the transformations as 
they occur, as they will occur -

The politics say of PMC's changes being something on the surface, virtual 
tiffany something still buried within the matrix, the rhizome, emerging 
only in a forgotten future -

And this is what, and only what, the past our present can leave us - that 
the future not only will be forgotten, but that the future already is -
