Dark Barrow of the Death within the Net





Always on fire, 

I course through their lives of desire

Moving against the semblance of glass, window

Pained with the hearing of it, invisible,

The body dissolute, indeterminate, within its mire

Which had sought well, slaughtered itself, remote

The time or recompense. I'd write on the morrow

With "considerably" less sorrow.

Morrow is now, and again, more or less.

My arms have lost sensation; blood rushes

In exquisite channels, killing the flesh

Which falters, decathects, and pushes

Sullenly against each possibility it will survive

That self-same morrow's marrow keeping death alive

In order to die: Thus death by death

Defeats death; only once, this minor victory

Against all recompense or morrow, ironically.



The membrane of the Net speaks and catches ghosts

Deep within its claws of flesh; there are hosts

And servers, buried deep within its furrows.

Once the dead died, buried deep likewise in barrows

Where ghosts once later burrowed; now, these morrows

Shudder at the strain of wires; tombed, they foam

Within domain or other, search for home.
