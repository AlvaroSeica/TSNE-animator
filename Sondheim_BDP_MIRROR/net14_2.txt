world.std.com is alive





Ping to find that the world is still alive; where are you, where are you

there; where are you, in this space of the breathing of the world, space

of the enormous sighing of the world, thrust of blood in a million hearts,

thrust of neurons in a million minds -



What does it mean that the _host is alive,_ that the host is kicking in?

It receives, processes, sends messages; it returns, enfolds, disperses

messages; it fragments, routes, gateways messages, enabling EMERGENCY

THROUGHPUT I AM COMING THROUGH EMERGENCY SPEECH NAKED FINGERING DEEP 

WITHIN THE SYSTEM I AM BEING FINGERED ON MY WAY OUT ON MY WAY ELSEWHERE 

I AM FINGERED I AM BEING FINGERED HUMAN OPERATORS STANDBY! STANDBY!



_Human operators standby on the edge, standby on the margins of things!

Dynamos thrust enormous maniac power of female voices sliced out cosmic

energy! No calm in cyberspace! Standby! Standby! No calm!_



STANDBY! STANDBY! I AM BEING FINGERED WHOAMI WHOAMI STANDBY! WHENAMI 

STANDBY!



Standby on the margins of the Living Host! Host tended on an intermittent

basis! Membrane skin of the drum sputters packets across the Mouth of 

Transsubstantiation! Cyborg ghost operators await your every call! Uncanny

Shape-Riders course the Salivary Glands of the interior of the Mouth!

Mouth it, Clara Hielo, the Host is alive! Mouth it, Alan Eliot, devour the

bones, the grit today, marrow tomorrow! Standby!



I'm fucked! Thrust myself into the dynamo, flesh between one wheel nothing 

and another nothing wheel! THE MEMBRANE OF THE LIVING HOST IS ENGORGED! 

YOU'RE ALL ME! YOU'RE ALL ME! STANDBY! STANDBY! NO CALM NOW! NO CALM!
