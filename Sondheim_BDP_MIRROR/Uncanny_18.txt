Subject: Modernization

I want to add a final spin on the MOO/talker material I sent out tonight.
In The Homeless Mind, a now classic text from 1973, the Bergers and Kell-
ner describe the concept of _packages_ which carry modernization and (my
interpretation) the ideology of capital into regions where they might
prove highly problematic. The use of stripped-down MOOs and talkers, how-
ever, could conceivably create the opposite - that is, communication
environments which would be easily tailored to local custom and needs.
While the computer itself is disruptive, the simplified command struc-
tures might reflect, not universals, but relatively common modes of
speaking and writing elsewhere. Obviously, literacy and the use of alpha-
betic script is necessary - voice recognition is still relatively pri-
mitive. But given these two requirements, plus intermittent phonelines
and sufficient electricity for a central server, there's no reason why
these systems wouldn't appear relatively uncontaminated and open.

Obviously, I'm being overly-optimistic here; I admit that. But I like the
vision of a lowest-common-denominator CMC - particularly since the Web is
becoming _SO_ overloaded in terms of corporate development, the presence
of advertising at every step, "name brands" such as Netscape, and hier-
archies of users based on the machines they're able to afford.
