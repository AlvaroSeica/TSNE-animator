Then


Then to continue from Now, two passages from the work of Edmond Jabes.
And let me first say that this continues the theme of REWRITE, and
writing in fact as a wound or cut suturing the dismembered body, as
well as writing as suffering. Then we find, in Jabes' _Letter from
Yukel to Sarah,_ in *From the Book to the Book,* the two following
selections, the first italicized within parentheses in the original:

    "Does the book, here, take the place of love? The
book is an object of love. Love manifests itself in the
book by hugging, stroking, biting sentences, words,
letters and, outside the book, by an unveiled passion
for the wounds become writing, fertile lesions whose
lips we spread open like a vulva to allow the sperm of
death in."

    "'There is no end to the sea or the book," you said. 'Words unwind
the transparent thread of days in the continual back-and-forth of their
life and death left to themselves.
    'Though the pen grow weaker and weaker, the book nevertheless
continues writing, in white letters, to the end.'
    Making a book could mean exchanging the _void of writing_ for 
_writing the void._"

Then surely these passages circumscribe this writing-community, white
letters _writing the void,_ for paper and screen exist in the absence
of writing, but it is writing that inhabits the void, and inhabits it
as a body, a body of REWRITE, capable of the caress, of love.

Then still it is a death-love which enters in, the blankness or silence
of writing and the written, and it is always a question of whose lips
are spread, what gender - or is it our own that breaks upon the presence
of writing in this space?

Then you see now, as well, the _completion_ which is also an opening or
portal, of this train of thought beginning with the questions, which as
well might circumscribe the entire project of the Internet Text, this
train of thought serving as a demarcation of the body, its presencing
in this void or space of denial. ][
