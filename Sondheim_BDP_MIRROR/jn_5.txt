Oppositional Structures, The Voice


Between life and death, a horizon or certain cessation.
Death carries the trace of memory upon its body.
Non-life or clays merges into life.
Death in opposition to non-life is the perfection of all existence.
Nature, culture, and artifice form an uneasy continuum.
What culture lends to gender, sex borrows from nature.
Artifice crackles and inscribes, where nature fissures.
The narrow defiles of life and culture spew down among natural death.
The dissolution of memory is the transformation of inscription into
 fissure.
Energy is everywhere among the speakable.
Nothing is unspeakable.
Lost in discourse, the physical body reinscribes as virtual.
Between physical and virtual bodies, a horizon or certain symbolic.
Death ceases and seizes the body in a paroxysm of absolute rupture.
Death is always already the grand narrative, inert and obdurate.
Non-life is an invasive procedure.
The absolute disconnection of the symbolic reinscribes on the plane
 of eternity.
The bias of language, the body, the gender, the sex, the culture.
The bias of language, the absence, the real, inscription, the nature.
The bias of language, the fissure, the fissure at the end of the rope.

(I can't abide lists like these, says Jennifer. It's just like Alan. No-
thing ever gets done. It's sloppy. The aphoristic disguises what exegesis
reveals. But I'm lying. I love wild theory. I love lists like these, what
they do to me, thrill me up and down the spine. I love the guise or mas-
querade of the real, present in each and every case. Alan will never speak
of thrills. One of these days, I'll insert him in me, in a sentence. I'll
name my cunt for him. One of these days, and so much for oppositional
structures.)
