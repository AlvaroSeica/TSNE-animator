Family


Travis would later think about it. That he had been duplicated on the 
MOO, that the story was a lie. That the MOO was text, emptied of text, 
text flooded from basement to cosmos. That the sung language sang into 
him, sung dynasty, multiple entrancings. But then he would think about 
it; it was the unconscious in him that was thinking like a language.

He would think about it. _It was unconscious in him to think._

He'd think about "family," the story he read.  That he had been 
duplicated in the text, that the MOO was a lie. That the story was text, 
emptied of text, text flooded from cosmos to basement.
