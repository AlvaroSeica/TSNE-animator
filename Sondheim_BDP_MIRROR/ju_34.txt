old man stumbles to the window tumbles to the ground stutters a lot 
you can't understand him his memories are burned to the ground a lot
he types a lot he's got no grounds to type pants are stained he's 
dribbled his coffee grounds putters in the window forgets what he
writes writes grounds he forgets fumbles with his fly open doped on
computer slacker keyboard grounded to the light socket his lights 
go out old man ground to a halt

er top she's wearing last night's hard nipples' he typed her last 
words fuck him he's dead she said fuck him fuck him
