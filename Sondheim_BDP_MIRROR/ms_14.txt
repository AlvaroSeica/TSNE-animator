azure-ectoplasm or the remains of wayward slaughter
perfection of ts'ao
can't seem to get beyond a sadness gripping me constantly. almost 60 and 
nothing to show for it. the death of america all around us. you can almost 
see the horizon lowered to the ground -
people coming over tonight for a belated chanukah - should be nice - i 
think of candles huddling in the dark - rising to the temperature to stay 
alive. it's as if the future is speaking to me, writing it all out, word 
for word at the moment -
someday i'll have a real job and stability and we'll both have healthcare 
and the world will be at peace -
in another country and another life -
reading dropping ashes on the buddha, 'zen master seung sahn' - gift from 
eugene - quite recommend it -
ellen and i will translate again this afternoon - back to the 1000 char. 
essay - it staves off the breathless dark -
if we'd known, would we have wanted to be born - 
azure says hello - we miss you - the boys and girls of the flying saucer - 
everyone -

- love, alan, say hi to everyone in brussels -
