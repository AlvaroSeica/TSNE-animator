N


N your limbs around me holes caught in trees and flowers a thorns of love
screaming against your holes on the way to w don't you lisp you dare call
me havoc striNper perfect love is always interruption striNper and they
have black bellies of black bombs mouthed and swollen lisp i lisp i can't
sleep without you, live without you any striNper i lisp i want your lungs
i lisp i want your flesh, the bombs mail don't give me your dreams as
well, oak floors are hard log if you lisp you leave me i lisp i will kill
you, if i lisp i kill you, you lisp you striNper they are coming again,
winged creatures have nsmail down on my knees beg you lisp you crawl thru
me striNper does his tongue rot ours? temp we choose to draw blood with
blood. striNper we choose to draw bombs with our blood, striNper we draw
smashed people everywhere lying and we die for our love, our flesh and
blood feeds clash together, clawed hard, torn apart and you lisp you bet-
ter hold me forever, you lisp you better be good
