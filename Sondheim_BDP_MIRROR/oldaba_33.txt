we're in byzanti um. clustered to gether, we fear- the world. thin-
roots are spiked in this drear ea rth; beneath our feet, the last r
emnants of sun.- i can't continue in the red light of ironmongers i
n byzantium. my- name is sondheim on the maginot l ine down so deep
we're invisible. the weary sky of fear. the magino t. the blue sky-
which is dark me mory. we are all hanged men. we k now it in our bl
odd bones. we wa it for emptiness in this darkness , all worlds inv
visible, our fac es lost forever. john, i say, i c an't remember yo
u, an appearance since i are youn g. our words are shattered by the
bombs.
