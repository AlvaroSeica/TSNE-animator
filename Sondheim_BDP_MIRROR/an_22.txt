Subject: Empathy and Magic



It was necessary to make subtle changes to the empathetic magic post, 
creating a simulacrum or equivalence between two versions; "black" for 
"dark," for example, the addition of two commas, the indication that 
"blackberry" does not "connect" anything, but that there are mutual 
circumscriptions... These changes have found their way into the file 
_an,_ to be added in a week or so when reaching the requisite number of 
kilobytes, arbitrarily set at between 60-85, to the rest of the text, at 
the URL ~spoons site.

This text will be included as well, referring to the earlier version, 
which you have received, but which will not be located there. Neverthe- 
less, these changes, subtle as they are, attempt to draw off critique at 
the past, for what can only be an inordinately difficult subject, to be 
drawn, withdrawn, redrawn, in the course of several paragraphs.
