The Animal


It's fifty years from now and there's this one animal left. It doesn't
matter what you call it, where it lived. It goes on now by artificial
means, intravenous feeding, automated evacuation. It has nothing to look
at, maybe its eyes are clouded over.

The animal stands there, it's recorded from every angle. Temperature, even
radio-radiation, audio, video, hologram, old quickcams and 4x5 plate cam-
eras, everything they could think of. Terabytes of information flow out
through thick cables, documenting its every move, it shuffles.

On and on and on, into huge computers, they take the information, alter
it. Suddenly there are recreations of tropical forests, African savannas,
Pennsylvanian hilltops, deserts at night. The animal's reconstructed as
wolf, ibis, snake, spider, bear. Now everyone can see the wildlife through
the glasses, through the screens, through implants. The animal turns in
its sleep, even the animal has to dream. Walls, nothing, the placement of
a foot. Overhead, screens, birds soar, shimmer. 

The tail of the animal, maybe, the whiskers.
