alan and azure walk across the frozen pond. thump thump thump.

why alan, says jennifer, i like the look of the sound of the footprints in 
all the exciting snow.

thank you says azure, i was walking just to his right and watching the 
microphone. it was most fun and look at the graph of the tilting picture.
