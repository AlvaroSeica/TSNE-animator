<h1 align=center>beginning of inordinate collapse</h1>
<multicol cols=9><b>
thinned grey wires carry too much bandwidth, heating nonetheless as the
electrical drops; what drops, splatters: one might say, almost zero
energy. today we talk about crash, not about the wounding. or rather, the
pierce, rather than the scar. an explosion of effect. 
what is corruptible here, affects effects there. there's only so much room
on anyone's disk. columns begin to teeter, fall: the _bandwidth of the
human_ continues to play a role. it's the same role, the same limit;
window-pane yaya opens to blasted industrial landscapes dominated by the
same; chemical construe the earths damned presence. consider this, you.
It holds on so badly!
Inhalation/interference patterings across exhausted sheets, the denouement
of what might have been the visible. So the writing goes; semantics flow,
impede: We're considering the future here, considering the _dammed._
What happens when truth loses its foothold, when impossibilty devolves?
Think of the cliff of the sublime (about which too much has been already
written), crumbling within the interface:
The interface is the human. The human lends us its ear.
