you may talk with others and you may talk and talk, and they may hear you.
they will lovingly listen to your talking, and they will talk with you.
and your eyes may be bright and open and innocent, and their eyes will
meet yours with longing and kindness. you may smile at them, knowing your
smile goes deep into them, that they smile back with gratitude and love.
you may turn towards them and with them you may face the new day, and the
sun rising above the trees and the mountains, and the pure fog lifting
into the pure air, and a delicate light bathing all, and the birds
singing. you may sing with them, and laugh, your laughter bringing tears
of joy, and you may share these tears of joy with your friends, laughing
and smiling. you may hold the hands of your friends, and you may put your
arms around them, and they will hold you, and they will hold you, until
the hurt goes all away. your friends may hold you, until the hurt
disappears, until your tears are gone, until your smile is so deep it will
remain always and forever. you will be so happy, and your friends will be
so happy. you will be so very happy, and your friends will be so very
happy, and the sun will rise ever so slightly, and there will be a cool
morning light, and the birds singing and wondrous clouds in the sky.
