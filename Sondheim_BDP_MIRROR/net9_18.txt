POLITICS DOESN'T BELONG TO ME





Every system has a culture but not every culture has a system.



Just as the equation y = sin cot x falls apart at the origin, which

remains either undefined (the infinite refusing the corral or inscrip-

tion of sin) or cancelled within the system, intertextuality has 

neither a home nor a place of insertion. For the origin is not so much 

a blind spot as a _blinded spot,_ oedipal to the extent that the 

identification of the source effaces the source which is never a source 

anyway but a concatenation, loose at that. All concatenations are loose, 

preferable to causalities, defined by weakest links. What are the inter- 

textual links in this case? What sort of epistemological wavering 

produces them? 



What sort of wavering constructs the disciple, always an American fiat

such that the proper name enhances the pleasure of the self, such that a

circulation? The rub of it is the metaphor; we need a dictionary. I offer

the following, in the spirit of y = sin cot x, contusion or laceration:

The dictionary belongs to no one.

Our bodies are for sale.
