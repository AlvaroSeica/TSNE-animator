This repeatedly appearing in my Inbox; it is always already impossible
to address heidegger; I have seen photographs of him in the Black
Forest; as a Jew, I have not visitied; I am sick with worry; philosophy
is always already lost as well.

What does it mean, a philosopher's address? What does it mean to ad-
dress a philosopher? To address a wrong or right? To expel an address?
In order that h. is _neither here nor there,_ _neither A nor B._ So
that language is lost. So that the shallow remains, in the name of the
scapegoat h., so that the false returns, in the guise of nazism, so
that _Heidegger is missing._
