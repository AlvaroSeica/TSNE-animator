the perineum sutures the embryonic body following the depression beneath
the nose, the crease in the lips, hairline on lower abdomen; the embryonic
body sleeps with its fingers curled and legs in foetal position, in the
realm of easy dreams and stirrings; turned towards itself, the body hovers
in memories of warmth, world-murmurs, lips wet with first and last sounds; 
eyes closed, the womb reappears brown-blood red; & all in a state of pure 
suspension, slow churning of always-beginning;

& o, thus suspended eye in midst of net, closed and held by grace and
empathy; & o wounds licked raw and clean for eternal healing; & o words,
of rapture and perfection; & o, always meshing language bubbled, clothed
warmly, soft in evening's always dawn; & o always-beginning, wryting in 
turn, netting, here asleep forever & none other
