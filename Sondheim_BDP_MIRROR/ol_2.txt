The Stanley Williams decision comes in the midst of text production:


Tom, I say, into the phone, are you there? Are you there, Tom? Pick up, 
Tom. If you're not there, Tom, you won't pick up, and you won't get this 
message. I might then leave any message, Tom, it would make no difference. 
Not even differance. You cannot bend to my will, you do not know my will, 
you are not present to listen to this message. Or you are listening on 
playback, and I am not present. Either I am not present or you are not 
present; in either case, time is transitive, but hopeless. It is the 
hopelessness of time that occasions this message, this message for you to 
pick up. I am speaking to the unhearable, just as you are listening to the 
unspeakable.

Where are Janice and Maria? Janice and Maria should be here, this is the 
last class, this is an extremely important class. In this class you will 
learn, a. the reason for the class in its entirety, and b. your grade in 
relation to the reason and your participation in the class. I am 
disappointed in this class, no, not in your presence, but in the absence 
of Janice and Maria, and for that matter, the absence of Tom as well. You 
will be marked down if you do not come to class. You have not been in 
class for the past several weeks, and may not be taking this class for all 
I know, any longer. I know I'm speaking to those of you who are present, 
but what else might I do? I can hardly speak to those who are absent, who 
are unlistening, not even to the rumor of my speaking; they are nowhere to 
be found.

Pseudomainia: The mania of false hands. 10,000 PseudoMainiacs: The mania 
of false bands. False hands play in false bands; I listen to neither of 
them. To be precise, I do not listen to hands in any case, but to bands, 
to what the hands, more precisely, the fingers, accomplish in relation to 
the bands, or rather within the bands, what the bands desire to accomplish 
in their entirety, to which I am both subject and object. 

The governor of California has just denied clemency to Stanley Williams, 
an unbelievably inhumane decision. We are living in one of the most 
racist, polluting countries on earth. I hope there are riots. I hope the 
governor's mansion is burned down. I hope the governor is burned down. 
There is no justice in AmeriKKKa. Poor Arnold says this is one of the 
hardest decisions he has had to make. He is present for the decision. He 
stays alive. His stupid grin is present for the decision. His stupid grin 
will stay alive. His righteous muscles tense for the righteous decision. 
His cock is hard. It stays alive. Bind it. Blind it.

Notes on DanceDesign


{{the projective} {}

{Image 1: mobile screen, shallow stage or variable stage. later this will 
develop into the piston-image. there are three performers. the screen is 
above the stage and tilted. it's rather shaky.

Image 2: sideview. the mobile screen is constructed from cloth. if lowered 
it might occlude or even block the live performers. two performers are 
visible. the piston is at the back of the stage. the whole ensemble is a 
deliberate mess. one can imagine the dancers somewhat uncertain of their 
projected appearance.

Image 3: from above. the stage opens down on the page. the piston is in 
back. the dancer and the image are: dancer <--> image, or identical. mixed 
ontology.

Image 4: D () A: dancer{}digital{{}}avatar{}analog. D,A projections. the 
stage has disappeared, replaced by ontology. the ontology is doing what. 
the mess (intermingling of states/processes) becomes evident.

Image 5: D(particle){{}}(wave)A. projection of dancer/digital interference 
with embodiment of avatar/analog. 'project/embody.' 'embodiment project.' 
wave loosely coupled with analog/substance, particle loosely coupled with 
digital/raster/pixel.

Image 6: <<dance|culture>|audience|<avatar|nature>>. dance does not return 
to culture, avatar does not return to nature. audience claps for dancers. 
dancers clap for audience. audience bows to avatars. avatars bow to 
audience. the encoding of the audience: dancer/avatar split. neither state 
nor process, neither before nor after.

Image 7: dancer (left) on messy screen {} avatar (right) on stage carrying 
screen. projector projecting dancer. independent (non-projected) avatar. 
how did we get here. illuminate all: nothing to be held in darkness. 
secrecy trembles before the projector () projection.

Image 8: everything = projector. the projection projects the projector. 
the projection projects everything. meaning is (a) projection (a) project 
back into thing (projector) thing (projection). epistemology occludes 
ontology occludes epistemology. white letters on black screen () black 
letters on white screen. projection is a process () of equivalence.

Image 9: the projection below (prior to) the projector. projection and 
projector on stage. blue sky below red sky above. or somewhat red above {} 
somewhat blue below. in-between: the white zone. everything moves in the 
white zone.

Image 10: the sun is night. night is below. stars like dancers are below. 
the night is black below. the thin yellow line: earth and all culture from 
the beginning of organic life in the cosmos. above the night: green earth 
{} dancers upside-down (head downward). dancers like stars. but they are 
not stars, not even stars-of-dance, nor are they star-like. they are () 
nothing other than above night against perhaps periphyton or stromatolitic 
(lithic) surface. this is not (the) dance. the dance is theater-bound. by 
which is meant this is not (even) for example a background, for example 
matisse.

Image 11: return to (Image) 9. projector and projection: root directories. 
white zone = yellow zone (illumination). language = corrosion. dancers 
(messy suture / unhealing wound) stretched among ontologies. what are 
projects/projections. absent projector (by which is meant the projector is 
other than the two-dimensional image surface. projector = voiceover = god. 
god is a project. the sun {between} projector () projection. this is the 
curtain(s) for the project(ion). ion-project: growth of which the theater 
{} dance is residue. everyone = frame. 3:05 - 3:39 a.m.} {}

Disappearance of worlds, all is lost, every moment of every day, what is 
right and wrong in this and any other picture, even the microbes change, 
transmute, worlds crumbling, worlds unnoticed, deaths of worlds, our 
deaths, our worlds among them

Disappearance of worlds, Edwin Schroedinger, the room in Arosa in the 
Annex of the Villa Dr Herwig, here one can imagine the desk, the chair, 
the books that were to change science, the air and its chemistry which has 
long since disappeared (replaced by combustion byproducts, radiations and 
other pollutants), the microbes in the cracks of the wooden floor, 
seepages where the walls cornered, ceiling interstices, and all since 
mutated, the particular smell of the place, the atomic-molecular 
constitution of the room which has disappeared forever, the sound of the 
snow perhaps, the coldness underfoot, perhaps the fire and its specific 
smokes and crackles, Schroedinger's pen, unobserved, the richness of the 
leather, the muted sounds coming from without, the air of excitement in 
cause of the reinvention of the physical worldview of the universe, the 
glazed sky, the cold crystalline air, the surfaces cold nearer the floor, 
warmed elsewhere, to the touch of Erwin Schroedinger, these moments, the 
memories of Schroedinger, his may loves, the woman who shall forever be 
unknown, his accommodating wife, the paper unruled perhaps, his amazing 
concentration, remnants of holographic notebooks, the winds and rattling 
panes, perhaps the sounds of wolves, animal scurrying in the underbrush, 
iced trees and long walks leaving damp spots, slight stains, in the room 
where Erwin Schroedinger compiled and completed the reintegration of the 
physical Weltanschauung of atomic and subatomic physics, the buildings 
perched on the hillsides, the peaked roofs, the dark gables and white 
exterior walls, the windows pursuant to the inn-keeping of warmth and the 
inhabitation of Erwin Schroedinger and the women who accompanied him, the 
distant sounds of vehicles, the Christmas of 1925, the new year of 1926, 
the smell of food, coffee or tea, in the room, the love-making of Erwin 
Schroedinger, the completed meals, the food taken away, the quality and 
color of the plates, the cups and saucers, the metal slightly cold to the 
touch and taste, of the spoons and forks and knives, the slight scarring 
of the body of Erwin Schroedinger maturing into early middle age, the 
women and the solitude, the specific references surrounding him, papers, 
notebooks, the presence of the telephone, the quality of its ring, the 
electric lamps and the dusk of falling snow, the worrying and the hounding 
of equations, the explanations of variables and constants, mathematics of 
quantum physics and vibrations of atoms, eigenvalues and functions, the 
distractedness of Schroedinger approaching the shores of universal forms, 
subtle background of chimney smoke, the inkwell and the black ink, the 
book of Schlesinger on differential equations, the sounds of laughter in 
the room of Erwin Schroedinger, the tinkling of glass from another room, 
smells of meats and vegetables suffusing the space of wave equations and 
the presence and slightly sexual smell of the unknown woman and Erwin 
Schroedinger, the air at 1700 meters in the Alps, the shadows and presence 
of the Weisshorn, the pulmonary tuberculosis of Erwin Schroedinger, the 
Viennese cook and the healthy cuisine, the small sounds of the pen moving 
across the page, slight cough of Schroedinger looking forward to the 
coming year and many more, the deep and sincere belief in the value of 
physical theory, the startling sound of a bird in the distance, echoing 
against the slopes, the rumours of Davos, mice scuttling across the floor, 
drifting snow outside, the windows darkened momentarily with a wintered 
squall, somewhere a crying kitten




the video of murmured life

http://www.asondheim.org/anja.mov 23 megs

w/ Anja Schmidt, this is a video made perhaps two or three years ago.
I've looked at it repeatedly; it's peaceful for me, something perhaps 
harmless, yet the warm-up speaks to eternal humanity. originally taped
at the Kitchen in New York, in a perparation by Foofwa d'Imobilite and
company. soundtrack recorded later, for the most part, on Mirage.

NTSC, the movie

http://www.asondheim.org/ntsc.mov
I spent hours creating at least thirty generations of intermediary steps 
to arrive at this small segment imitating the look and feel of the Toaster 
software operative a decade or so ago, early digitized effects created on 
an analog base. What is the point? That noisy lunacy reigned from Young- 
blood's Expanded Cinema, even decades earlier, all the way to the advent 
of the purified digitized image. Youngblood was not the first, but he 
described the nexus of video manipulation, influencing at least two gen- 
erations of young video- and film-makers. Now granularity in the image is 
reverse-engineered, low-frequency color blooming is added, posterization 
is manipulated in any number of ways, and feedback itself is distorted as 
if there were analog delays and colorization technology in the image 
chain. I no longer yearn for those days, but I do miss the ability to man- 
ipulate video signals on the fundamental levels of pedestal, bandwidth, 
and so forth, as if the signals were _signals,_ rough derivations of the 
real world. This short tape is a paean to those days. Enjoy; the sun is 
setting on our eyes and minds.




I'm sorry I wasn't able to deliver your message.


In Geneve the dancers waited in the cold.
The image bloomed and blossomed and the world faded.
Parochial, I only remember Claire and Mary.
The Shelleys watched the domestic drama unfold.
They died but not here, nowhere near here.
Apologetically, they left the film and story.

Male and female bodies were zipped closed against the wind.
You can imagine who bundled up who.
We all wear culture underneath our clothes.
Our skin is our message.
The dancers of Foofwa d'Imobilite were immobilized.
Their only desire on the bridge was warmth and a comfortable home.
The United States of America would free them democratically.
Iraq = the Christmas-time joy of the whole wide world.
Jesus gouged the eyes of Jahweh Allah.
Jesus: "All gods see better now."
The dancers disappeared like ghosts upon the bridge.
Their bones were ice; their skin, fire; their minds, clear and bright.

Why We Love George Bush


George Bush is a strong man and always says what he means.
He speaks simply to the common people who understand him.
We know that every word he says is a dagger to the intellectual.
Those people would stop us reading the Bible and take God away.
God helps George Bush fight those people.
He clarifies things in a world that only seems complex.
He doesn't use all those words that don't mean anything anyway.
He asks us to stay the course and we're his men for the job.
If you ask me he was lucky to get out of military service.
He's a deeply religious man and God leads our destiny.
He'll never back down to any of those countries in Europe.
He has a loving wife and two incredibly sexy daughters.
He's got to keep those daughters of his under wraps.
George Bush can fail just like the rest of us.
But he finds greatness in every man and we find greatness in him.
He's turned his back on that Yale education of his.
He's come back to the land and understands how wealthy it is.
He knows the animals were put on God's green earth just for us.
He's an oil man and we'd all be oil men if we could.
George Bush listens to the preachers not the professors.
He prays ever day for the nation to stay on the path of righteousness.
George Bush is a tough man who never listens to the polls.
George Bush can spot a liberal or a homosexual when he sees one.
He is our man in the White house.
He has gone a long way to giving colored people their place in government.
We'd love to have a beer with George Bush and talk about everything.
George Bush is really one of us.
He really loves sports and hunting and fishing and doesn't forget to pray.
George Bush is the first President really love.
He doesn't forget that his nation was forged by Christ under God.
He doesn't forget every newborn child.
He sticks it to the rest of the world.
George Bush understands that you have to attack Godless evolution.
He knows what sorts of dirty stuff the kids are learning in school.
He knows just how bad the Jews are.
He stays away from the Jew media and then gives it to them.
George Bush says America First to the rest of the world.
He's going to bring Freedom to dictators everywhere.
George Bush is so successful in Iraq people don't see it.
Because of him our children are fulfilling their destiny.
Bringing God and Freedom to the whole wide world is really wonderful.
George Bush has really given it to Al Qaeda.
He knows those people should be tortured and he tortures them.
He'll say what he has to say but then he tortures them.
He's probably tortured them himself just to get the information.
George Bush knows that freedom comes at a cost.
Look how well he has handled New York City after the planes hit.
People in New York City think he loves them.
George Bush secretly hates New York City but he doesn't tell anyone.
He is a true Born-Again who follows the Righteousness of his Faith.
God tells George Bush to slay the pagans and he does.
He is the most courageous President we have ever had.
He will do what God not man tells him to do.
George Bush would get down on his knees and pray with us.
He has the sexiest greatest daughters in the world.
George Bush has the perfect family with problems like our own.
We can tell that he likes laying back with a beer now and then.
If George Bush wasn't President he'd be down at the local bar with us.
You know he talks our talk and walks our walk.
He could fail at everything but he can't fail at being President.
He understands that God has created the greatest nation on earth.
George Bush won't let the white people down.
He knows that the white people came here first.
He knows the white people are the real Americans.
George Bush knows that a woman belongs in the home with her children.
With George Bush you could play cards and he might even cheat.
Then if George Bush were caught he'd give us that great smile of his.
It reminds me of the game we had last week when Larry was drinking.
Of course Larry's not President but his hands were a bit messed up.
I think it's his wife and that cooking course she's taking.
Of course we'll all eat her cookies.
George Bush would sit down and eat her cookies like everyone else.
He'd wait his turn like everyone else.
It's incredible how great he is and how the country's prospering.
Those liberals could take a lesson from him.
He answers only to God. (I bet he answers to his wife too!)



birth of code unease

there is no birth of code, perhaps it is our universe.
any representation is already embedded in another.
perhaps you can't have representations without symmetrical substructures.
with 2nd-level code that's certainly true.
but a painting is another matter altogether.
in a painting (this is a painting of code), the eye does what the eye
 will (what one wills) (what is emergent (out of (in relation to)) chaos).
what i will <-> thinking a posteriori, the periphery.
i would have willed this if it would have been willed.
perhaps these sentences are phrases, unpunctured, opened
the world is all that is the easement
one can always try to force heidegger, i.e. retreat to alterity
why is there something rather than nothing <-> not always already your
 words, not even the ghosts of words, not even your own
(the) question(s) dissolve(/s) in the wind of presence
in this sense (inverse), why/cause = god
appeal to meaning, transcendence, and human culture falls to its knees
in any case, my pleasure, your presence

sin(tan(x)) or tan(tan(x)) never fail to excite my imagination as these 
simplest of functions tend towards machinic limits in graphic calculation; 
there's no end to 'em but there's always an end to 'em dependent on the 
machine/algorithm. i suppose the calculation could be carried out 
indefinitely just like the raster here supported from 20-400 could be 
downed to the pixel, but then what? everything else is either force or 
averaging. one's caught in the usual digital trap, that what is of 
interest must be evidenced within a bandwidth that most likely has little 
relation to what's of interest. the bars keep information out, peripheral 
or problematic information, troubling information, alterity. w/in these 
images/imaginaries, nothing more than that, alterity comes back, corrodes, 
with a vengeance, but not really; the merging of the two produces beauty 
which is always the case.

CINCINNATI!

tonight we flew Jet Blue across country from NYC getting out just before 
the big New York City subway transit strike to Salt Lake City in Utah; the 
trip was fabulous with satellite/DirectTV, watched BBC America, they had 
one of their dissection programs on. what made it unusual was that the CEO 
of Jet Blue was also on the flight, talking with everyone, just like he as 
a real person; he told us he does this once a week which might go a ways 
to explain why in the US Jet Blue's (why "Blue's"?) doing incredibly well 
while everywhere else the airlines are blowing it with their passengers 
(not literally of course), going into chapter 11 or bankruptcy. he said 
that 80% of the employees own stock in the company. wow, it's weird; I 
think that a number of other smaller carriers have the same deal, maybe a 
"worker" is taking over or passing messages to other works (people). I 
wonder if anyone ever thought of this before, I mean worker's control so 
that workers own the means of production and run things themselves? I mean 
why does anyone have to tell anyone else what to do??!! what else was 
neat, you could watch the plane's progress across the whole country which 
leads me to ask, what if the plane was hijacked and no one told the 
passengers where they were going and then you could look at your tv in the 
seat back in front of you and you could tell where the plane was going and 
if the other passengers didn't know what to do or were too scared to do 
the same thing you were doing you could yell out, CINCINNATI!

credo

unutterable horror

if I did not _this_ and _now_ it would not, would never be, would never 
have been, done; this is the unutterable horror of death, with which I 
face every moment of my existence. I imagine myself near death, with the 
recognition, whatever I do not say _now_ will never be said, that these 
sights are my last, my own, and not my own; that my possessions, which I 
have carefully tended for so many years, will lose their inherent skein 
with new distributions; that I will never see an end to anything, nor to 
myself. with unutterable horror I continue to write, as if texts would 
stave death from proximity; these myths no longer work; I no longer sleep, 
or no longer sleep well; I survive to write _this_ text and only _this_ 
text; what I have promised myself - the knowledge of a new language, a 
visit to a foreign country - will never be done. when I open a book my 
first thought is always, will I survive to finish it; will this make a 
difference, certainly not to myself, on the verge of total annihilation. I 
cannot imagine such; such is literally unaccountable, unimaginable, 
replete with intrinsic absence. every saying, every utterance, is a gain- 
saying. this horror is not abstract; it is as concrete as the physical 
pain I also inhabit, and only the onslaught of physical torment will make 
my death bearable. I am a coward; such is not the case until disease or 
accident wills it so. I write, I create, as fast as I do, because it is 
all I can do; it is the only thing to be done; it is always the last rite; 
it is never enough.




the soul

I almost grasp the soul, which is obdurate, inert, hard as any real, ready 
for the byte of heaven/hell, nothing liminal, intermediary. battles are 
fought for it; the soul is the soul of war, of possession, the spoils of 
war. it is the soul that motivates the imaginary of occidental thought 
into anthropologies of conquest and conquest itself; it is murderous, of 
value in the service of God. the soul is not the mark of reincarnation, 
nor the mark of its own bardo-making and unmaking; instead, it is a thing 
and a treasure which is unquestioning of existence, ontology, nothingness. 
question the soul and our dis/ease is evident; what we cherish is our 
ruin, and the ruin of others. the soul separates us from ourselves; an 
invention of the desert of nomads, it is the last stronghold of a world 
always already slipping. the legends of buying or selling souls are always 
uncanny and always speak the truth of fable's metonymy. look to the soul 
for violence; it is incapable of redemption, incapable of entrance and 
exit; it is nothing at all but slaughter.

every one a murderer


original photographs of world war two battleships

stereograms of world war one trenches and bodies

original photographs of world war two pacific fighting

stereograms of world war one technology

world war one will now be abbreviated wwi

original photographs and other papers taken from world war two 
japanese dead

world war two will now be abbreviated wwii

an illuminated koran from 1847 cairo slightly opened
the pages will not be damaged

a korean painting of a tiger-riding shaman several centuries old

a top secret wwii map of the iwo jima battlefield from the battlefield

projections of torn avatars over furiously moving dancers

projections of dismembered avatars over propellers and gratings

nomadic tent located on the hardened gallery floor full-sized
with video within

a small photograph of a japanese wwii fleet presumably near yokohama

murmured texts played back from scattered monitors hardly organized 
or present in space of every one a murderer

sexual projections over dancers and without dancers and sexual
confrontations there is no rest in this space

with the uttermost beauty of human beings there is no rest here and
here in this space

static images of dismembered avatar imaginaries torn into uncanny
beauty and troubling poses

dark spaces of rattling building vibrations sublated to aural 
frequencies of the human organism they are here

dark crackles of very low frequency radio trembling in the presence
of human bodies auroras lightning decay of particles across the
cosmos near and far

i am so ashamed i cried when i saw these images written large somewhere
in the vicinity of wwi and wwii

the 1895 telegraph receiver mounted in the antique trolley car clacking
away and electronically echoed from sourceless speakers sounds and 
presence of ghosts

the this of this is you and the you in this splayed space

space of ionizations ionized air recorded space of radium decays
space of furious nighttime guitars garcia lorca spanish civil war

space of inscribing of inscriptions of the last inscriptions of soldiers
dying and all memories lost recuperations of names and translations 
from foreign tongues

the evanescence of horror in the absence of horror naming horror in its
very absence

every i is murderer every i makes love

You don't need Halloween
To know where I've been -
Out in the rain
And out again -


some british measures, 1844


(somewhere between the long shadow of the medieval guilds and the 
dominance of local custom before the automobile and plane - every 
mercantile space its customary measure. as international communication 
grew, so did the need for standardization. here is britain in 1844, 
near the beginning of this development.)

i have aimed my microscope at geneva switzerland
international boundaries collapse into unnatural quanta
my microscope never has enough power
this 'lack of power' is based on universal fabric

http://www.asondheim.org/quantum.jpg

nevertheless there are glimmers of something uncanny
beneath the surface specificity rules and arises
surface corrodes specificity corrodes surface

what we perceive is always an uneasy balance
 between corrosion and purity
 slimemold and quantum

what you have is what has you






now we are looking at geneve incredible focus
a single atom in geneve sings hello

i am my microscope and sing hello duet
now we are in geneve



betaville


were coasting thru the stars outside the cosmic highways of paris
there is evil everywhere about us and we cannot stand the glare
we look and do not see, he says w/ Caution
Maria swallows him whole in the world of the last protein sex

everyone gets tired and stuck on the side of the road
the side of the road used to be called the shoulder
now its off in another dimension altogether Im nowhere sure
were hounded were getting there our maps and our star will guide us

http://www.asondheim.org/betaville.mp4

ave ave ave take us to your leader
go farther than your leader leave him and her behind
the wind blows high and raise the roofbeam carpenter
our ornamental hood guides car and ship to unknown galaxies

'hello hello im your nearest neighbor
'your next-door unknown galaxy come in sit by the fire
'were warmed by memories of burning ancient stars
'one of thems your own dont worry youre safe here'

'tell us your journey and never say your names
'youll go soon enough we wont remember them
'theres nothing left and nothing far ahead
'nothing port or starboard nothing up or down'

'float well sail high upon the space of space
'ave ave hello goodbye goodbye'

were coasting out of paris the eiffel far behind
were churning out the world hello goodbye





grapheme ii 


wires connecting WWII field telephones across the floor
the receiver responds to buzzes, spherics
the universe moves through the wires
the universe speaks through both headsets everyone and no one is listening
what what what hello hello hello

an antenna leans against the wall the sound from the trolley car comes 
through the outer room

sometimes things seem almost like languages in these rooms of 
fortifications and despair
sexuality and language
the language of despair and sexual fortifications
the fortification of language and despair of sexuality

nomads come into the room and settle down in their tent on the hard floor
there are many names for the tent which slips from room to room
wheels from room to room

dances on the tentpoles ravens at the four corners of the world

inscription machine of exaltation and despair
_homo homini lupus_
millions of people die to satisfy the longing of one masturbation
'we are _that_ species which' ...

we will use up animals in our totems we will record animal cries
field telephones carry animal cries across the arena
 field telephone <--> field telephone
 does it matter who is speaking who is listening

soldiers fight one another in the arena while listening
to animals crying 'we are animals' 

the wolves take pity on the humans
they caress them and protect them against the snow
against the avalanches and starvation against the cold and damp
and a warm place to sleep and to love

you are the only other animals that smile, say the wolves,
at least as far as we know, we have never left these mountains

a helium nucleus leaves its home
it happens without notice
