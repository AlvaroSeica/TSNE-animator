Trivial Morality


There's nothing I would die for, except by my own hand, relative to consi-
derable thought; I demand that right. But there is nothing to believe in
so strongly that I would cancel _outcome,_ pull my house down, lid shut.
To die for something is to believe, I'd think, in an absolute, that it is
_this_ which is worth the cancellation of the horizon. Certainly no recom-
pense against its absence.

When defuge sets in, when decathecting is universal, then it's the time to
say goodbye; or when pain storms the horizon without end, then the prime
mover is its alleviation. But I would also argue for a suicide for trivial
reasons; it should be the responsibility of the man or woman to decide his
or her life's worth. I don't believe, for an instant, in remaining alive
for others; this is the height of the selfishness of the world. One lives
either because one desires to live or because one doesn't particularly de-
sire to die; the rest is foolishness.

If I reach a very old age, I will not embrace the foolishness.
