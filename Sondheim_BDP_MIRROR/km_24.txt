+ From Barthes, The Grain of the Voice, Of What Use is an Intellectual +


_There was a time when intellectuals considered themselves to be the "salt
of the earth" ..._

For my part, I'd say that they are more like the refuse of society. Waste
in the strict sense, i.e., what serves no purpose, unless it's recupera-
ted. There are regimes that do try in fact to recuperate the refuse we
represent, but, fundamentally, waste is useless. In a certain sense, in-
tellectuals are useless.

_What do you mean by "waste"?_

Organic waste proves the _passage_ of the matter it contains. Human waste,
for example, attests to the digestive process. Well, intellectual attest
to a passage of history of which they are in a way the waste product. The
intellectual crystallizes, in the form of refuse, impulses, desires,
complications, blockages that probably belong to society as a whole.
Optimists say that an intellectual is a "witness." I'd say that he's only
a "trace."

_Then you're saying that the intellectual is completely useless._

Useless, but dangerous; every strong regime tries to keep the intellectual
in line. The danger he presents is symbolic in nature; he is treated like
an illness under observations, a bothersome supplement one keeps in order
to confine within a controlled space the fantasies and exuberances of
language.

_And of what passage are you the waste product?_

Let's just say that I'm doubtless the trace of a historical interest in
language; and also the trace of many fads, fashions, neologisms, buzz-
words.
