Parable


Later on, Daishin Nikuko climbed the mountain. It was stony; gnarled
pines leaned out over cliffs hundreds of feet above waterfalls, mist,
and the darkness of clouds getting ready for the grey soaking of the
middle-early night. 

Daishin Nikuko climbed with her left hand. She met Daishin Nikuko com-
ing down the mountain, with great difficulty, her right hand holding
back the earth rushing towards her. ( Because of the instance of the
meeting

it was possible for Daishin Nikuko to turn back halfway up the moun-
tain, and for Daishin Nikuko to turn back halfway down the mountain,
using her strong right hand in her climbing.

At that perfect meeting point, a small pearl is still to be found in
the midst of the stony path; no one may move it, ( but the will of
earth and heaven.
