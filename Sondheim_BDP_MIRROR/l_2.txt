(What is case, then, if not articulated structure, instructions in the
sense of structural bloom? Case involves typification; it is the basis for
sight, for language, for culture, the following of form.  Instructions
need not be well-defined, confined to one or another semi-organized level
(i.e. assembly language, molecular binding); they may be fuzzy, ontologi-
cally suspect (sublimation, return of the repressed). They need not be 
carried out; they're geodesics, paths of least resistance, chreods; there 
may be nothing to carry them out; there is no necessary agency at work.)

(I'm not raising case to the level of a fundamental ontology or epistemo-
logy, but relegating these fundamental investigations to processes of cir-
culation - which is in accordance with postmodernity's emphasis on the
loss of metanarrative. But it's not a case of postmodernity or postmodern-
ism in any case.)

(The case still remains, elsewhere than the abstract, emerging in popular
culture, scandal, tabloid analysis, the limits of scientific investigation
(the case of such and such a galaxy, at the limits of the visible uni-
verse) - or the case becomes a framing-device (contents of packet trans- 
missions, public access television shows), protocols, in the small or in 
the large, not always simulacra.)

(It's the case that's missing, the case of the missing case.)

(But not the establishment of a fundamental category, not a case-logic,
not a case-ontology or epistemology, neither case-psychology or philoso-
phy, not a return to the case itself, reification of the case, nor a 
deconstruction of the same or other.)

(The case is never all that is the case; that is the case.)
