s/ms: More on Linkages and Couplings

Both linkages and couplings imply an _association_ of elements; in a link-
age, a transformation of one element necessitates a transformation of ev-
ery other. In a coupling, the transformation of one element implies only
that the association possesses one transformed element. From [A'BCDE],
given [ABCDE], it's clear that the coupling [AA'] constitutes the differ-
ence between the two couplings; hence this is reversible in terms of his-
tory. But given [A][B][C][D][E] and A' then [A'][B'][C'][D'][E'] is global
of course, a perturbation, and it's unclear that, for example, C -> C'
hasn't been the initial transform. Note that in a linkage, of a term is
removed, one might have a cut in a concatenation; every cut separates the
end-points (version of the Jordan Curve theorem). (For a single element
[A], coupling and linkage are equivalent.)

These are all quite loosely connected! Look for other conditions to make
the real!
