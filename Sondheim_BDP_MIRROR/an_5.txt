Listdeath iii

Clearly a list doesn't die; a list is made up of subscribers, moderators,
and machinery. The notion of "listdeath" is at best metaphoric for what
may happen to one or another member, nothing more - feelings of fatigue,
fallout, and so forth. Only at the beginning of a list is there a sudden
flurry of new-found interest, with, very often, enormous numbers of subs
as the word spreads; things then settle down into routines with smaller
peaks. So listdeath is burnout, the feeling that one has ridden the cycles
already, that moves are predictable, that the return isn't there. We float
in and out of this; our eyes closed, we see the unix prompt waiting reso-
lutely for new input, returning the old, for trajectories that will in
fact swerve off the groove instead of hardening and reaffirming one or
another projection of personality, true-real or fictional construct. It is
the throughput that characterizes all of this, both for those discovering
subject and object simultaneously, and for those who cross paths with pre-
defined neural energy. We move across trajectories of attention and perso-
na harbored within us. Bracketing the list as a _bundle of messages_ is
healthy. Paraphrasing badly, lists don't die, desire does. The result can 
be a sensation of _sloughing off._
