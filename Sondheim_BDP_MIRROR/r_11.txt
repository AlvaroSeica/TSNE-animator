L/oo\k

Towards the side of the screen lined with bamboo
Autumn fallen into pools, carp enunciations
Too formal for the peerage of eyes and finials
Arriving customarily through loosened footing
Doubling the site of pure looking through leaves
Rooted across the earth of sky and water strewn
Across with leaves hewn from charred and darkened wood
Or lewd eyes if not peerage doomed to use of others'
Shadows by the door, haiku spoken slowly, terms of
Bamboo pools too, loosened footing, looking rooted, 
Or wood, doomed door, and bamboo pools 
Of pools of look
