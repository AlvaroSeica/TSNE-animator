Addendum 


It became clear to me, why wasn't it earlier, that the twist shares a 
relationship with the abject, and with suture it is an almost-closure, 
almost-alignment, that fails by the very nature of the world. The abject - 
indecipherable, entangled - lies at the juncture of organism and analysis. 
A lure, it's impossible to eradicate; it's of the nature of space-time 
itself, for the twist is produced by _any_ circulation. This is, for 
example, the meat underlying the virtual, which on one hand is a canopy, 
and, on the other, is the very constitution of inscription. For we deal 
with an entanglement of inscription, beginning with ourselves, which are 
simultaneously everywhere, and nowhere, and in terms of phenomenology, 
part and parcel of curvature. The "dirty little secret" of the world is 
the world, which analysis flies in the face of, to the extent that 
analysis insists it has any relation to the foundational.
