years ago i was jumping around
these are the images i just found

because i also found a mac powerbook g3 at the salvation army with 
accessories slurp slurp and extra memory for $99
and i was looking for my software disks to install lovely macisms
so there was this disk and these things and i thought why not

the susans

http://www.asondheim.org/susan.jpg
http://www.asondheim.org/susan2.jpg
http://www.asondheim.org/susan3.jpg
http://www.asondheim.org/susangra.jpg

susan graham images from my susan graham works

the dings

http://www.asondheim.org/ding1.mp4
http://www.asondheim.org/ding2.mp4

off the screen imagery, i was lazy, from mathematica transformations
you get the idea not the detail
oh sometimes this keyboard is skipping on me now
too much typing and thinking back hurts
call it a day, a day
call a night a night

This trip worries me. I haven't been away from home for years. It's true!
They let me go, they really did! I didn't ask for it. I was too upset -
I've always been upset... I remember that day I was walking in the woods
with you and we came upon the bodies. We didn't know what to do! I thought
to myself, God must be terrific to let me find these bodies! We kneeled
and prayed. A great light filled the forest clearing, and we heard a voice
telling us to put our hands up and leave the crime scene. In no time at
all, we were jailed. Later the famous lawyer, Normal Siegel, freed us. At
this point we are celebrities, and that's why I'm here. Think of me as
"the guy who found the bodies in the woods" and you will have a good time!
