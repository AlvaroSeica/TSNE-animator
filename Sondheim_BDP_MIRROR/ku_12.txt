(from N.)


I received the bomb from Dimitri. I took the bomb to the flabby heart of a
knot of soldiers. I released the bomb like an eagle with great-talons. I
gave myself over to the bomb and I released it. I presaged the machines
and I did know of the machines. And I issue a warning:

THE MACHINES WILL SUCK YOUR ENERGY.
I released the bomb like an eagle with great-talons.
THE MACHINES WILL SEE FOR YOU, DIRECT YOUR EYES FOR YOU.
THE MACHINES WILL FILTER EVERYTHING THROUGH THE EVIL APPARATUS.
THIS IS NOT A TEST OF THE MACHINES, THIS IS A WARNING I WILL GIVE YOU.
I released the bomb like an eagle with great-talons.
THE WARNING LEAKS THROUGH THE MACHINES, THE WARNING TELLS YOU:
 THE ENERGY IS GONE.
 YOU ARE ALL ALONE IN THE MIDDLE OF WIRES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
 THERE IS NO ONE TO TALK TO, NO ONE BUT THE MACHINES.
 THE MACHINES WILL LISTEN; THE MACHINES WILL TAKE IT ALL DOWN.
I released the bomb like an eagle with great-talons.
 THE MACHINES WILL HEAR YOU SCREAM:
  THE ENERGY IS GONE.
  I AM ALL ALONE IN THE MIDDLE OF WIRES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
  THERE IS NO ONE TO TALK TO, NO ONE BUT THE MACHINES.
  THE MACHINES LISTEN; THE MACHINES TAKE IT ALL DOWN.
I released the bomb like an eagle with great-talons.
  THE MACHINES HEAR ME SCREAM:
   THE ENERGY IS GONE.
YOU ARE LISTENING NOW, SAYS N, TO THE ENERGY OF A VACATED BODY.
YOU ARE LISTENING TO THE ENERGY OF THE ZERO POINT.
( I released the bomb like an eagle with great-talons.
THE STREETS ARE ABANDONED; THERE IS COLLUSION IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE ZERO POINT IS CROWDED WITH CLOSED SETS.
( I released the bomb like an eagle with great-talons.
THE CLOSED SETS ARE INFINITESIMAL STRUCTURES AROUND DISCRETE POINTS.
THE DISCRETE POINTS ARE MONADS THAT HAVE NO RELATION.
RELATION IS GONE IN THIS GONE WORLD OF THE DISCRETE POINTS.
THERE IS NULL, SAYS N, YOU COULD NOT RECOGNIZE IT
I RELEASED THE BOMB LIKE AN EAGLE WITH GREAT-TALONS.

cause the machines have grounded you in your blindness and you can't see
how empty you are, your only motions the clattering of the keys late into
the night, your only arms swinging the mouse over its pad and it don't
even live in that pad,
I RELEASED THE BOMB LIKE AN EAGLE WITH GREAT-TALONS.

cause there are wires emanating from the machines in all directions, and
they're the nerves dragging your mind down among the integrated circuits,
and you think, says N,
I RELEASED THE BOMB LIKE AN EAGLE WITH GREAT-TALONS.

YOU'RE ALL MIND BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE MACHINES HAVE DELIVERED YOU,
YOU'RE ALWAYS IN THE HOLODECK BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN DELIVERED,
YOU'RE ALWAYS IN VIRTUAL STEREO-LAND BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN
( I released the bomb like an eagle with great-talons.
YOU THINK, WELL, YOU'LL MOVE YOUR ARMS, SO YOU MOVE YOUR ARMS
YOU THINK, WELL, YOU'LL MOVE YOUR ARMS, SO YOU MOVE YOUR LEGS
YOU THINK, WELL, YOU'LL MOVE YOUR ARMS, SO YOU MOVE YOUR NECK
YOU THINK, WELL, YOU'LL MOVE YOUR ARMS, SO YOU MOVE YOUR MIND
( I released the bomb like an eagle with great-talons.

the bomb's from Dimitri who called and said, get that knot of soldiers
over there, they're after you, they're the slayers of human flesh, they
have scales and rays where their eyes should be, forget the helmets and
greatcoats, they're the slayers of our human flesh, they are plug-ins 
and they have sixteen million colors and their St. Petersburg is our
St. Petersburg

& the bomb's over there in the midst of soldiers of great brass scales, of
great monstrosity and breathing fire, of great smoke and inhalations, and
the bomb falls like a rocket or a spire, of great tumultuous sound and
pereginations of fire and sharpnel

& you've lost your energy & all your fluids leak & your dead eyes see
SIXTEEN MILLION COLORS & your dead ears hear TWENTY THOUSAND HERTZ
& your dead lips taste nothing & your dead fingers touch PURE FORM
& your dead eyes SEE NOTHING & your dead ears are dead ears

I've known this for a long time, says N, and I've been afraid to express
this. I've been afraid to declare myself in this community. I've been
afraid to say, I'm a daughter of a bitch. I'm afraid to be with you. I'm
afraid to kiss you. I'm afraid to penetrate. I'm afraid to fuck in front
of everyone and kill them all with you. I'm afraid we'll kill them as they
die.

I'M AFRAID WE'LL KILL THEM AS THEY DIE, 
I'M AFRAID WE'LL KILL THEM AS THEY DIE

I released the bomb like an eagle with great-talons, says N
