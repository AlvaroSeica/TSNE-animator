Parable


What did you do with the atoms, asked Nikuko, as they left Nara, heading
south. Bad mistake, said Izanagi, there was a loophole, they'll destroy
themselves. Not again, replied Nikuko, we should readjust the cycles of
worlds; let them be born elsewhere, keeping the balance. Where do you
imagine, said Izanagi, adding, perhaps in another universe altogether.
Nikuko replied, Excellent, and if we leave gravity behind, they could just
float around if the atoms misbehave. Atoms, said Izanagi, this time I want
nothing but fluids; we could have two elements and a whole lot of informa-
tion. About what, said Nikuko. About where everybody's been before, and
where they'll be going, replied Izanagi. Then they might stay put, said
Nikuko. No, said Izanagi, they'll come back, they always miss the little
things in life.
