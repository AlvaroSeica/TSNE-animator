{k:18}Jennifer calling the Colonel:
			*
Oh do come to me so sweetly, for I, you, we, will we now, 
for I will have all the world's dark time, and you, Colonel,
you have time lost, LostTime, this missing file in which
I deposit all the world's lost words, all those letters,
numbers, those signs of dreary punctuation  -
			*
Come, Colonel, let me sit upon your knee, I shall raise
my pinafore so prettily, do not forbear
the passage of wise time while your soldiers, dark 
from heat of passage through the wired jungle,
patrol, patrol, and will never ever notice, for I,
I, Jennifer, have all this time at my disposal
			*
And against your death, do give it all of you, and towards
your death, to take it from myself, only to return it all;
while you, Colonel, disport against my knee
with gallantry, your soldiers march their bamboo way to
victory. I shall remain, you notice with your dying words, 
for I have still this wondrous time, this disregard -
I will do you grand, Colonel, I will do you grand.
