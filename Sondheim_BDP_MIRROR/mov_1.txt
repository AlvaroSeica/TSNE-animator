the chant of trilby-svengali





i am her trilby to her svengali and she is my trilby to my svengali. i

have to create them. svengali's mental. shape-riding nobody. svengali and

trilby make perfect fuck, sharing the dream of svengali and trilby



mysterious svengali as he creates electric light to see her better



trilby to svengali's edison, dolly shot in cinerama, her trilby to her

svengali, my trilby to my svengali. she nobody. svengali and trilby make

perfect fuck, sharing



mesmeric rosy nipples entering miraculous singing long white gown falling

open from her shoulders evening primrose licking her feet drinking her

urine before the guests i will kill you but my voice must be pure tongue

within, show them who is mesmerized degradation beyond degradation

degradation beyond belief her staring is uncanny, almost as if she leaves

so quickly now, almost in a feint naked, thou hast cast me into this role

naked, i am dying of love, sweet song, mesmeric one last kiss, one last

note, one touch mesmeric songster of the night entering breathing deeply

miraculous singing hands trembling in the air evening primrose licking her

feet i will kill you but my voice must be pure tongue within, show them

who is mesmerized degradation beyond degradation degradation beyond belief

applause from an audience of thousands her staring is uncanny, almost as

if please, i can live no longer like this naked, i am dying of love, sweet

song, mesmeric one last kiss, one last note, one touch
