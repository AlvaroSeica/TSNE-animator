in the form or focus of a neutralization, charged singularity, dullness 
acting upon the world, in the corner huddled, there's still the issue of 
weight, bod body body pressed hard against the triple crease of wall wall 
floor / floor wall wall / wall floor wall a perfect moment perfect as the 
flesh sinks into the node where bod bod bodies join structure against all 
comers. this is the node, i.e. what a node can be. this is what an i can 
be. this is the winter of the world. this is the disappearance from 
space. this is the cracked ice. this is the dark rock. when the bod bod 
body is the terrain, when the terrain closes the bod body body like a lid 
or the bod bod body sinks into itself, he whispered in 1926. think of 
this serge as a node. think of this, with a nod, as a node. others like 
you serge. i didn't hear i pressed myself dark towards the wall, stronger 
towards it, bod bod body into huddled tow.
