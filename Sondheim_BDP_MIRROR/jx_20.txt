You, Love


Frightening, this speechlessness experienced in your presence, having no
signifier, sign's trajectory, looped from nowhere. Frightening, that
lightning is not lightening, that glance and glint are different storms.
The waves one does, electromagnetics, illuminating you. There are more
sides to you than I can see at a single glint.

I will write a bad poem, text, because there are no sides, and 'glance'
does not remain a family of singularities. Because there are no wires
connecting us by prose. What I am trying to say, your face across the
immanent sky, that I am illuminated by lightning; if anything signifies,
it's these attempts. Yes, I've made them.

Because it's a bad poem and form to do what I've done, acknowledge fail-
ure, turn the thing around, realize it's entirely visible by a single
glint. It's not you, that's for sure, and it's not the love I feel. I
can't even say, 'it's your face.'
