Pure Bombs


There wasn't a war, there was dust in the air, the Porsche left in the
garage was stripped, wheels and motor gone, the rest left on rusted
blocks. Given what was going on, who'd want the chassis when power to
leave was everything. Well, it was. The light, naked tan-yellow; the dust,
thick in clouded world.

In the distance, the bombs were going off, two of them now, small atomics,
and you could see the thinned mushroomed pillars like ragged cocks from
clouds scumming the ground away. What wasn't in ruins. It was the land-
scape of pure bombs, and Denise and I were entranced, there they were, we
were still alive, terrorized, exhausted, aroused, despondent, hopeless.

It was the time of pure bombs and pure bombing, it wasn't terrorism or
all-out war, it wasn't local or contained, hardly a test, hardly an art or
artwork. It was bombing pure, bombing simple, neither vector of destruc-
tion nor millennial cleansing. It was the day of the bombs, night of the
bombs, existence, space-time of bombing, an essay, metaphysics, a story,
our inert.

We thought that our last thoughts might be of this order, pure bombs and
pure bombing, our last hours upon the burning planet, by virtue of this
inert violence, as the world sustained hit after hit.
