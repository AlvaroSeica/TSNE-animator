MINE


arms and legs cut off no control over what YOU do to ME to MY texts to MY
words where YOU are what YOU are thinking of what tales YOU tell built on
the ruins of MY words as I did say and reiterate

THESE words which are MINE which you desecrate and VIOLATE all FOREVER and
and and I suppose I might insist that RIGHT HERE is an interruption when
YOU know better that I'VE placed whatever trash is in YOUR way right in
THIS spot RIGHT HERE it does seem to keep sliding

YOU'LL do to ME whatever YOU feel like anyway I shouldn't complain IT
DOESN'T DO ANY GOOD whoever YOU are I mean YOU MIGHT AS WELL BE MY EYES
while YOU'RE AT IT or EARS WHATEVER

JUST LEAVE THE LETTERS AT THE DOOR WHEN YOU LEAVE THEY'RE MINE MINE MINE
MINE MINE MINE MINE MINE
