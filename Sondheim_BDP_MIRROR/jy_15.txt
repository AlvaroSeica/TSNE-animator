Umbrella Text About / Above These Spaces


Jennifer necessitates a new text, reminding us that Julu is an origin
created ab nihilo a posteriori. Jennifer moans through Lulu (Berg and
Wedekind), Jew-Lew, JuLu/Gal, Jewel, pheromoaning the cup the container
that has now sprouted a _leak_ upon the floor of the bathroom.

Where the tiles (not Penrose) hardly meet, where caulking foregoes the
suture of the real.

The imminence or texture of the body. Which is not the same, not partob-
ject perhaps, _here_ in this space, displayed metaphorically - there are
after all leakages, umbrellas everywhere. Rain drips according to the
fissure.

Which is a division, not an inscription, of the same. If you follow me
carefully, you will understand me perhaps.

It is of grave matter that there is no matter. It is no matter that matter
is of the grave. If you follow me, you will arrive at the path: Jennifer-
Julu,,,alterity.

Of grave _import._ That languor of language. _Resting_ on the line, not
linear, _there._

It is always as if there were a _certain truth,_ that of the matted room,
a hut _open to the elements._ I would advise you that there is great
beauty in the industry of the atmosphere, 'dusts and radiations,' Japan.
