CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS





What I do for you is of worth beyond calculation; this is the domain

of the permanency of truth itself, our highest goal. Given the oppor-

tunity, I expound ceaselessly upon my Welcome Addition to culture 

in its highest, most sublime and perfect form, and the following, 

indeed, is indicative of such an exposition - occasioned, in this in-

stance, by a posting questioning the very validity of Net discourse, 

much to the detriment of myself and my followers - questioning it, in

fact, in such a manner, that I can only assume that it, as well, was

written by myself, perhaps in a moment of discomfort or even further

enlightenment.



What I do garners the precious life and instinct of true and beautiful 

resonance producing the utmost respect and real adulation wherever it 

inspires the muses to pour forth onto the soul of the recipient, always 

an achievement which remains unparalleled within the universe; these are 

hardly late-night ravings, but the inspired messages of perfect thought 

which I produce for myself and everyone so ensured with the quality of 

language and conceptualization on the Internet that my thinking is 

recognized as of the highest - indeed, there is no Higher.



Hardly cacophony, but a truth clean and simple, a truth absenting noise 

and obfuscation, the truth of the trace and the obdurate, simultaneous 

science and truth engraved in the hardest stone destined to outlast the 

Babylonians, so I continue, as in Old Hittite: "[(nu a)]nda sittarit 

itten mahhanda are[...]s= a apinissan iste[n]": "[the king] established: 

Begone! As your comrades, so you [...] too [_a_] shall be" [1] or thus to 

compress: ITTEN! ITTEN! BEGONE! BEGONE! for such a truth, that of this 

_going_ or enunciation of it, remains as indicated by the DAMPING INDEED 

of tan(sin kx), the levelling of the playing field within and beyond the 

Newtonian calculus of finite differences carried to the infinite degree.



So that it is not a question of questioning my authority, since as I have 

pointed out time and again, the question drawn forth is always already a 

lack, [2] but a questioning in fact ONLY if such authority is accepted, 

the opening of the (wound within the) INTERNET SOUL itself - so as for 

this truth hardly being the case, it is certainly that (hammer!) (hammer!) 

my truth (hammer!) is (hammer!) all that is (hammer! HAMMER!) the case, as

LW himself would have said, having put aside the Tractatus-Logico-Philoso- 

phicus for the thinking which I am capable of doing. For thou art speaking 

or writing to THOUGHT ITSELF which shall brook no THOUGHT, and I am wri- 

ting through you, in fact, THINKING YOU INTO EXISTENCE.



What exists I have thought through the FELT FORUM of the REAL, the COZY-

MATERNAL CHORAL OF LANGUAGING... [3]



[1] Thus my primary source, Silvia Luraghi, _Old Hittite Sentence Struc-

ture,_ becomes one with the _emphatic,_ the predicate in initial position

as in "da LUGAL-as SAL.LUGAL-s= a ain wain pittulius= <s>muss=a," or as

translated in the text (and how apt this remains to this day!): "take 

away the king's and the queen's affliction, pain, and their distress," as

I might locate myself LUGAL _only_ in the realm of thought, old-Hittite 

or not...



[2] The question remains primarily an apt signifier of an occasioned ig-

norance or a request or an elucidation which I grant only to the extent

that I also grant your existence within and beyond the realm of OBDURATE

TRUTH itself, as indicated here. 



[3] Travel, little text, throughout the electronic webs of ever-thinning

wires, webs of gossamer thought which I have spun for you, webs of pure

disbelief! Travel, little text, into the realm of flames themselves, 

those tiny hells of our own making, pitting one against another, one in

the midst of another, all-for-one and one-for-all! Travel, little text,

may you have a happier life, long after I am gone, huddling quietly in a

far-off corner of an antiquated hard-drive of gigabytes of pure, pure,

memory...
