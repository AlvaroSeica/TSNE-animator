piss


if i were to tell you any more about cumberland it would be a story,
wouldnt it. and thats not what it was at all, not even lived or this and
that happened although they all did. cause what i want to tell you is the
way the words held back, something different, the way there would be
consideration. it would always be there, the slow talk burning its way
into the woods, cutting paths, traces, making lazy words in the landscape
like the smoke rising in the winter holler. all this in spite of the
telephone which doesnt reach or the tv which does. 

shed hang in there with her wet pants only her wet pants on. the sun would
be silver in the folds. like a silver dagger i heard about. all day long,
that silver dagger. all day long. 

shed lie back and piss in them, flood herself out. the piss would leak
onto the boards of the porch down through the cracks. it would leak into
the dark shadowed earth, the earth which rustled at night, lay supine,
fertile in the hours of the day. hed hold his breath he would. if he were
to tell you a story it would be that he held his breath like that. as if
there were a happening where there weren't none. that he had the silver
with him all his short short life. that there was coin after all.
