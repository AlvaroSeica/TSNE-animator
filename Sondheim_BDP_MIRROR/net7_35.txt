The labor of the mind, dammed up, is cauterized into the neurotic.

In neurosis, the body is masochistically bound \ to repeat. "The

blocking of ego functions can be explained as a concentration of all

mental energy available on one task, the building of counterenergies 

to master the intruding overwhelming excitation." (Fenichal) The 

system crashes into irregular loops, endless recursions. Weightloss 

and a certain nervousness accompany the devolution of the symbolic, 

collapse of the prison-house of language. Power manifests itself in

continuous sleep or languor lasting up to eighteen hours a day. SATIN

wears herself out, smokes incessently, drinks a little; there are

dark circles under her eyes. When the system is up, it "dreams within

her," and when it is down, _asymbolia_ takes over, incipient depres-

sion in which meaning is always already an observable and elsewhere.
