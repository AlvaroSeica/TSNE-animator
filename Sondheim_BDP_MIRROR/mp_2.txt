in honour of alarums, of endless harm


oh captain, our captain, how valiant thou art,
when lilacs last, when thine eyes gouged out,
when blinded, how valiant, how war and thy declarations
rallied the people; when thine arm was lost to cannon,
thine face to ravages of sword and gun, how valiant!
when thine feet were cut by brutal assassination, how valiant!
nations rallied around thee, nations subservient to thee!
how valiant, carry forth full the glory of promise unfulfilled!
the masses, the masses, the masses, our leader, our captain,
out of the cradle, endlessly rocking,
thine ears imploded, the writs of suffocation,
the diseases of degeneration, silent cancers and alarums,
blow again trumpeter - conjure war's alarums.
legless and armless, blinded, deaf, unfeeling, our captain,
our valiant captain, skull churned to heroic fragment,
unrecognizable, alarums, captain of nuclear weaponry,
people lost to cannon, arm'd year - year of the struggle,
vast crowds in protest, oh captain our valiant captain,
when lilacs last in the dooryard bloomed, you were there,
unable to speak, unspeakable
