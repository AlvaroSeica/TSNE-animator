Soldier's memento, WWII


The enemy of the world is our enemy.
The world is our enemy.
Accountancy systems absorb our very thinking.
VLF radios account for whatever is left over.
The saddest mementos of the world, everywhere in the world.
The saddest mementos are unaccountable.
They are the remnants of orphaned memory.
The remnants of orphaned memory are all the language humans have.
VLF radios record from past and future billions of years.
Bacterial mats, alone, for the majority of the world's history.
Radium emits what VLF radios record, signs our futiliy,
what our enemy, the world, has granted us.
The telegraph clicks uselessly.
What was granted, what is taken away.
