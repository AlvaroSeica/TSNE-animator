 And I want to talk about this space. I want to talk about it because

 there is no talk in it. And it is a window, because there is no talk.

 I need to talk about the window.



 Michael was not going to be there because there was work to be done,

 a window installed. A text file on fiction-of-philosophy ended with 

 an account of `meaning sucked out the window' and subsequent files in

 the archive were destroyed.



 I need the window, the space of the window. I need emotion and anger

 sucked out of me. I need to thank everyone for their kind words and

 letters of condolence, and I need to ask for space and time, a room 

 of my own, where I can begin to understand this _ascii_ which I do 

 not understand, which I write about, proudly.



 I cannot help anyone with problems and I cannot help my own problems

 and I do not know what to do with my grief, which ebbs and flows, nor

 with yours. I need this space to deal with it, and I do not think

 that a funeral or silence or memorial is an answer, because there is

 no answer except what is deep in us, and funerals or memorials die 

 quicker than people do.



 I was closer to Michael than to anyone on this Net and I do not know

 what to do with this closeness, which I carry around, empty. There 

 was an energy between us and we were excited about Cybermind and

 saddened by the lack of intimacies in our lives outside the Net. And

 I cannot stop thinking about this and other things because and now I

 know, that the mourning must stop so that we can have the sweetness,

 which is all that we can have.



 Let us please, please, move on, and I cannot help anyone and cannot

 help myself, and would if I could, even beyond the measure of the 

 text. Let us begin thinking about the world, now, with all its 

 terrible beauty.

 

 Alan
