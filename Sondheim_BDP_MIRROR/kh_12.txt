Parable


Daishin Nikuko met a lion in the desert. Where have you strayed from,
she said. I have strayed from the flock, said the lion. Mine or yours,
she said. The difference of the hunter is not the difference of the
prey. If it were, she said, there would be no hunters. If it were, 
said the lion, there would be no prey.
