WWF:

Just to illustrate the degree of biodiversity loss we're facing, let.s
take you through one scientific analysis... The rapid loss of species we
are seeing today is estimated by experts to be between 1,000 and 10,000
times higher than the natural extinction rate.* These experts calculate
that between 0.01 and 0.1% of all species will become extinct each year.
If the low estimate of the number of species out there is true - i.e. that
there are around 2 million different species on our planet** - then that
means between 200 and 2,000 extinctions occur every year. But if the upper
estimate of species numbers is true - that there are 100 million different
species co-existing with us on our planet - then between 10,000 and
100,000 species are becoming extinct each year.

*Experts actually call this natural extinction rate the background
extinction rate. This simply means the rate of species extinctions that
would occur if we humans were not around.

** Between 1.4 and 1.8 million species have already been scientifically
identified.




Swollen: solo sarangi with octave halver

I just love this piece! It carries the depth
that I want from bowed instruments; using 
octave halving gives me the doubling of the
instrumentation. I was thinking of shakuhachi
playing and enlightenment throughout. And I 
was thinking how absolutely great this would
have sounded at SXSW! Please for Sakyamuni's
sake ENJOY!




Audition

so today I went to my favorite pawnshop and found a dirty
messed-up electric guitar with the name 'Audition' on it,
with four strings, two of the geared tuners broken, pretty
much rusted tailpiece, one knob missing, one that wouldn't 
turn, a broken and useless nut. so for $20 I got the thing
plus a four-string nut, tuned the four strings like a pipa 
- ADEa - cleaned the instrument, got the knobs to work,
used wire to cut out as much of the hum as possible (the
pickups aren't hum-bucking) and have had a grand old time
with the instrument, which it turns out sells from $400-
$500 in good condition, from 1965 made by Teisco in Japan.
I love the oddly dirty sound and can use it when I'm with
sax players; anyway here are three pieces:

 - but see the following descriptions -
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/audition1.mp3
 - this is a blues improvisation - the first music 
 I learned was the blues - not so much the commercial
 stuff - fairly slow here -
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/audition2.mp3
 - more experimental work taking advantage of the 
 pipa tuning (which I used for all of these) -
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/audition3.mp3
 - just a minor scale improvisation but I like its
 energy -

enjoy, they're not long - alan -
