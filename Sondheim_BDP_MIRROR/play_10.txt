MOUTH


<Curtain rises. THE PRESIDENT and Jennifer are on stage.>

THE PRESIDENT: I think I've been forgotten. The play continues. I've been
sitting in the audience. You learn a lot of things in the audience.

THE THEATER: Roar roar roar. You're inside me just like an avatar. I sense
your presence just like a tumor. I breathe you just like a virus.

Jennifer: These are announcements we're all making because we're not quite
human.

THE PRESIDENT: I take care of your eyes.

Jennifer: I see quite well, thanks to you.

THE THEATER: Roar roar roar.

THE PRESIDENT: Please be quiet. No one wants to hear you.

Jennifer: THE PRESIDENT is part of the audience. THE PRESIDENT listens, a
function of everyone here.

THE THEATER: Roar roar.

THE PRESIDENT: I am responsible for language. What you say is threaded
through me. I like the words, though, in any order. The order doesn't
matter.

Jennifer: THE PRESIDENT says the order doesn't matter.

THE PRESIDENT: I am perfectly powerful; my power is splintered, broken,
which gives me power. I have more power than ever. My power grows.

Jennifer: You are a duly elected official.

THE PRESIDENT: The term is decided only by the term. I am THE PRESIDENT
outliving the term.

THE THEATER: Roar.

Jennifer: You are a duly elected official only for the term. But the term
is yours and you extend it.

THE PRESIDENT: I am your tongue. Your tongue takes care of your eyes. I am
your tongue. I am your lips. I am your mouth.

THE THEATER: I'm going home.

<Curtain down, house lights up, all exit.>
