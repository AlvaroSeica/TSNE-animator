Subject: Short-Wave







Monitoring the Spectral Mother*





I have listened a lot to short-wave, introduced the signals into my films 

and videos, and others have followed suit. I monitored 9260 and 14562 

when there were anomalous signals on these frequencies; I did it for 

months. I followed regularly radio Tahiti and Pinyang in N Korea, caught

Radio Moscow immediately (ten minutes) after the downing of the Korean 

Airliner, when the first announcements came over.** Now short-wave is dis- 

appearing as a government medium, taken over to some extent by mainly 

Christian right-wing stations, and the airwaves are growing more and more 

silent as people turn to the relative reliability of the Net.



I miss the crackle of the ocean, the sound of solar flares and sunspots,

the ionospheric bending, breathing, as day turns into night turns into

day. I miss the signals like shrieks, unidentified always, the numbers

stations still out there, voices and sounds from the depths of the ocean

where Internet is carried, if at all, through satellite transmissions. I

miss the sound of the earth itself, signals escaping into space with ex-

ploits always and everywhere. Or the rumble of whistlers down in the long

waves, all of these silenced as short-wave becomes less and less an option

for culture, although all those musics, and there was nothing like running

through 3am Indonesia, where are they now but grounded here in the digital

realm, the clean and proper body where planetary cries and whispers are 

filtered into all-too-convenient packets, bound like broken perfect 

bodies in fiber-optic cables.
