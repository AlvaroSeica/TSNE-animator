West Virginia University Talk, English 

Language, playing music, and Literature:

Speaking with the absent body, speaking without the body.
Writing involves:
Preparation, a sheet of assertion, conventional symbols and encodings, 
potential well (so that nothing happens to the text as it's being written),
storage, transmission, preparation. It involves stepping-back: WHAT HAVE I 
DONE?

Speech involves:
Improvisations, embedding in time, real-time, somatic issues, gestures,
'aura' beyond symbols, in general 

Electronic literature involves a great deal from both writing and speech!
Think of writing through filters - similar to graphics filters:
Some simple examples:
tr, sed, grep, fold, cut, awk, cp, rev, sort, sort -k a.b
With perl scripts you can do much more (I can give these to you):
eliminate.pl, antiorp.pl, elimx.pl, alan.pl, orp.pl rp.pl, elimy.pl, 
elimz.pl,
elim2.pl, elim3.pl, al3.pl
With awk: all sorts of possibilities:
fil, fill, filter
With extended perl scripts:
.julu, julua, parent
Using talk or chat - 'culling' texts or textual bodies
