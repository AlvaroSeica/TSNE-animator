because they have been climbing you know in the swirling,
the results of the code, perhaps you meant this, but they
were particulate matter going nowhere and indecipherable
but i think even more than that

'i think more' 

but they were swollen and swoling, swole. they were always
in motion and half determined and half trying to leave
the place and have not caring about leaving the place

and for the movement of the cradle rocking and never dying
or never the cessation of movement or the moving

she's taking a snooze

she's watching the  sky

she's thinking about pancakes

she's thinking about shaboom

the doctor got her measure

she took it back again

she's jonesing and dancing

shaboom shaboom

her life is her life

she's taking a snooze

la la la la la

wait til she gets up

la la la la la

rarely does an informal moment embrace the numinous
azure and i had corresponded for months and finally she was arriving
i photographed the plane coming in around five in the morning
neither of us had any sleep and this was our first close meeting
she came and is still here after six years

i knew when i was photographing the plane i was taking it
awkwardly i also embraced the moment and its eternal memory
a tourist destination or sight among personal histories

the plane taxiing to the gate
nothing was open in the airport and i had been there for hours
it was an early saturday morning of sometime
i remember having to teach the same day among disinterested students
everyone had their personal tales

back to the photograph
the creation of a minor history that is what i call personal
it will die with me it will be only the picture of a plane
the plane at a particular angle to the gate and only the plane

someone on the plane was coming to meet me and others on the plane
the others were coming to meet others perhaps not as propitious
or perhaps equally so or perhaps in the dwelling of mourning

http://www.asondheim.org/punctum.gif

i had misplaced the image and found it on a forlorn isolated floppy
it would play from the camera through the floppy into the computer
it would be revived the newborn image greeting the light of day
or of night or of dusk or dawn or liminal when the image was taken
when the image perhaps took me with it and then lost itself
or i had misplaced it as i already said here is the plane again

here is the plane again and again and again
it is the picture of someone on the plane and the plane
it is the plane of someone the someone-plane coming forward
the someone-plane coming forward to the gate
where i am at the gate waiting to make history a personal history
or a minor history waiting
or just to greet someone and awkward with the camera in my hand
hardly seeing neither seeing or seeing hardly

any minor history, any punctum, any someone waiting, any someone
and any plane taxiing and any plane arriving and arriving
and arriving and again and arriving and again

it got older and bolder
it blew apart and remained blue
she showed me her shoulder
neutrinos and neutrons tracked her back

 follow the girl to the mountain
 follow her back to the rock
 take her and she'll break you
 for your life is on the block
 and your body's in the stock
 and you're winding down your clock

there was an evident was it moscow
was it greek too many spikes differently
it mapped into human unconscious
it is unheeded warning unreadable sign

unleash the power of wilson cloud-chamber
magnetic isotropic lines of power
magnified in the literature of the rock

 of the fury of the shock
 of creation of the unconscious
 which attempts understanding undermining
 delimiting and lining

the literature of the rock
broken in the fury of the shock

death and the dying
writing in her REMAKE blood

what the censors were looking for adult fare
something for special unit crime stoppers
REMAKE crawling in her own blood

vlf radio connected to minidisk in the middle 
of brooklyn, what would one expect but the power grid
hardly a crackle to be heard
someone turned a television on or off
minute and a half of 60 cycle plus harmonics
turnabout is fair play
turnaround is too, not to mention chorus or filters
more interesting later from the country
in the meantime what's happened here driving the machinery
spiced up for everyone's amusement at least mine

A narrow, damp _alley._ Sur vey, to _view._


All the _assistance_ found, his _assistants_ sent him. He claims to be the 
_diviser_ of the machine. Which is larger, the _divisor_ or quotient? This 
_difference_ being settled, he will pay due _deference_ to your opinion.

The _ingenious_ mechanic was also an _ingenuous_ man. Not a _lineament_ 
could be recognized by his friends. Apply to the wound a healing 
_liniment._ The _principal_ to the agreement was devoid of moral 
_principle._

Though a great _liar,_ he could play upon the _lyre._ A _naughty__ youth. 
The lawyer had a _knotty_ case. The _plaintiff_ assumed a _plaintive_ air. 
Do not disturb the tame _rabbit._ The carpenter will _rabbet_ the boards.

Filled with _choler,_ he seized the youth by his _collar._ The priest 
filled the _censer._ He is a _censor_ of the press. The ship took _divers_ 
persons as _divers_ for pearls.

The _air_ is quite cold. He is _heir_ to the property. Give _alms._ He has 
lost his _arms._ He cut tree with an _ax._ His _acts_ are _base._ He has a 
_bass_ voice. 

They _burst_ the box which held the _bust._ The poor _dyer_ was in _dire_ 
distress. After a _dose_ he fell into a _doze._ In the falling _dome_ he 
saw his _doom._

- from Eclectic Spelling Book, 1865
