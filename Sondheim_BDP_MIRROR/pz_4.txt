Touching and Knowing


Julu Twine touches hirself in that special object-place and it resonates 
across all of Second Life, Julu Twine is alone, alone, alone, and no one 
will talk or help hir or rock hir to sleep in the endless cradle of that 
soft and airless world. Touching and knowing, touching s/he knows -

1 is for the scattered sky-debris

http://www.alansondheim.org/yetagain2.png

2 a second bargain running out from me
spewed in the air as far as eye can see

http://www.alansondheim.org/yetagain3.png

3 is for the shapes from me to unity
against the desert background and reality
they come it comes I come above the sea

http://www.alansondheim.org/yetagain4.png

and then a change as paralyzed I be
unmoving and unmoved no longer free
I'm on the ground and arms are in a T
locked and frozen staring uselessly

http://www.alansondheim.org/yetagain5.png

before I was transformed from he to she
within a sky-sphere rocking endlessly
I moved and flew and crashed against the key
embedded in the sphere that set me free
and threw me to the ground I could not see

http://www.alansondheim.org/yetagain6.png

6 is for the he before the she
or rather s/he trapped and spherically
held fast against from falling dangerously
already caught and bought I could not flee
instead accessorized another me of me
and rendered vertigo falling as a she

http://www.alansondheim.org/yetagain7.png

yet more adore among the rocks it's me
floating to myself effortlessly
within the duplication of a tree
a forest floating well above the sea
so dream with me beam up with flying me
there's nothing more to hear much less to see
but journey's end where flying sets us free

Hasapi solos

thanks to Steve Tobin, the Sumatran instrument was identified as a Batak 
hasapi. An online source described the instrument as the only one with a 
variable resonating cavity (the jaw-harp and vocal cords are similar in 
this regard): The hasapi is played with the opening (on the back) against 
the body, and by moving the instrument in and out, the resonating chamber 
couples with the player. You can hear this on the recordings. I play with- 
out a pick (it's difficult for me).

Performance Notes, Beam Me Up


early preparation (Julu Twine and Dojoji dance):
http://www.alansondheim.org/ddaance.mp4
http://www.alansondheim.org/dddaaance.mov

the performances in Odyssey are most often a mess.

it's almost impossible to negotiate the space.

performers and objects are equivalent and difficult to distinguish.

metaphors include debris fields, information implosion, opera, mania.

sexuality is cut and distributed on high-speed jagged edges.

language and movement transform into subject.

language and movement are relays and dissipations.

the futures of virtual worlds lie in the inconceivable.

virtual sexuality transforms the gaze of pornography into cartoon dynamics
- what dominates is social intercourse, semiotics transformed from vision
to vision-movement.

the social becomes physical; the physical becomes social.

you lose the smell of the thing; you lose the thing.

an implosive economy of permissions, domains, parcels, server and land
capacity.

filtering options constricting and regulating land and particle rendering.

always to set a landmark, teleport out of there.

nevertheless bound by someone's concept of physics, virtual and otherwise.

physics of ostensible three-dimensionality and ordinary phase rules.

no magnets but seduction of voice and image beckoning you onward.

the performance is a gaping maw in the gaping maw of Second Life.

all orgasms possess kernels of fantasy, terror, loss and recuperation.

this is a beautiful installation which will be rendered harmless in its
absence.

the width of a skin is a pixel.

the width of your body is four centimeters.

the metrics of your body dissolving in membrane, tissue, skein, touch,
ignoring the fallow screen.

the last words I ever hear will be your voice.

in an instant you are in my arms, in an instant I am in your arms.

to find me you must touch me through the flurry of skins and prims.

you find yourself when you fuck all that you hold dear. for an instant,
the onslaught of existence.

there is more in the air and beneath the surface, there are surfaces as
the world flees from you everywhere.

I made the world flee from you and I can return the world, as I write the
world which is my world, in and out of existence.

your presence is my cue, your presence is my clue.

come join me as words will never hurt me, worlds will never hurt you,
words are all there is, in this tiny space, words are all there is.

words are worlds are words.

in an instant, everything swept away, universal maw, annihilation.

the universal maw, survival in chaos. the performance performs chaos.
beyond this, annihilation. I write the death of the word.

I write the death of worlds, death of the world. I write the death of the
world, death of worlds.


Performance and after stuff


Performance jpgs from Beam Me Up performance with Sandy Baldwin and 
pre-performance preparation with Alan Dojoji and Julu Twine.

Unfortunately the mayhem was very difficult to capture in stills.
And easier in video but the video would be untowardly large for download 
or for that matter uploading on my end (although some will emerge later); 
please be patient, a little sadness is a good thing:

Afterwards, this evening, documenting the strange alterations that 
occurred as the chaotic debris of the performed space settled down:

(Below is a general description which I've prepared for an online class 
coming up.)

I have an installation in the online virtual world, Second Life. If you go 
http://slurl.com/secondlife/Odyssey/48/12/22 - you will find it. In order 
to use this URL, you need to have a Second Life account; you can get this 
at http://www.secondlife.com . The installation is called The Accidental 
Artist and is quite complex - I've been changing it for the past eight 
months. You can find all sorts of images and videos from it at 
http://www.alansondheim.org/ - these include a number of performances that 
have been seen and recorded world-wide. (The last was February 11.)

Let me begin with silent film. Roberta E. Pearson, in Eloquent Gestures: 
The Transformations of Performance Style in Griffith Biograph Films, 
distinguishes between two fundamental modes of performance: the histrionic 
and the verisimilar. I associate the former with melodrama and the latter 
with a presumed 'natural' acting style. Melodrama operates through a 
semiotics of stereotyped poses and movements (hands clasped in prayer for 
example); traditionally, theatrical poses might be held for a few seconds 
- forming a tableau (waiting for audience reaction). You can see this mode 
in operation in silent films; characters will _stop_ and hold exaggerated 
gestures, as the diegesis is transformed into a meta-narrative of segmen- 
ted moments. I claim that this semiotics (which also extends into and 
through subtitles) plays out in virtual worlds as well, since characters 
are given stock responses (animations) which may be played one after 
another, in serial order - at times there may be 'behavior collisions' - 
situations in which animations compete with each other.

In my virtual world (Second Life) work, I use files that have been 
produced by altered motion capture equipment. A human performer, wearing 
sensors, moves in a regulated environment, and the movements of the 
sensors are recorded - this results in a file that allows an avatar to 
mimic the movement of the human. In my work, however, there are two 
differences: the sensors are remapped onto the body in a 'non-natural' 
manner (head on foot for example), and the software itself is rewritten in 
order to create what I call 'dynamic filters' - the original human move- 
ment is filtered to produce new and inconceivable movement. This is the 
sources of a great deal of my work, which starts from a 'natural' order 
and proceeds into a distorted digital/virtual one - which may then be 
returned (through live dance for example) in another altered form to the 
'real' world. I see my avatars having the potential frenzy/energy of 
silent film and the wild movement of Buster Keaton.
