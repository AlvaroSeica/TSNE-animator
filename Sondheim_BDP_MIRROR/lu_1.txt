language in irc (internet relay chat)





there are three types of languaging:



>>hello

hello - just where you speak and it appears, and this serves in addition

as a declaration of presence; it's speech, nothing more - it may be reply

or affirmation or expostulation, interjection or query - there's always

the expectancy of the other, always something in return

>>/me says hello

Alan says hello - thus a performative, Alan performing in conjunction

with the assignation of the /me - the inclusion of action -

>>/me turns around

Alan turns around - the performative connected with a material action -

thus _in the virtual realm_ all actions are necessarily performatives -

this holding as well with programming - so that semantics are intended as

well - /me turns around always already ikonic - attend to this distinction

- just as the speaking above is also ikonic -

>>/echo it is raining out

it is raining out - here the language is itself the material substrate of

the world - the world constituted by language - if the /me indicates

process, the /echo indicates state - however

>>/echo the world burns

the world burns - and the state may well be a state-description of an

action whose performance is subtexted by the neutrality of the (re)quoted

expression 

here in virtuality all expressions are doubly or triply quoted -

in ytalk doubly quoted - i type, transmit, you read

elsewhere triply - i type, i read, transmit, you read - three different

instantiations - resonances - sheaves 

>>/echo it is raining out

it is raining out - the description of the world is already the state of

the world - however the /me in

>>/me is taking a walk - there is a separation - as in

me < is taking a walk - the expression is piped; in

>>/echo it is raining out - here the /echo is a modification on

it is raining out - as in e(it is raining out) - or as in

e(x)

x

whereas with /me thinks it is raining out - 

m(thinks it is raining out) > $n + thinks it is raining out - or as in

m(x) 

$n + x

as if there were the construction or constitution of a number series -

in any case the presence of the other - that is 

the name $n

as an adjunct or supplement to the string x. 

where does this lead - to three states - that of enunciation, that of

action, that of world-constituting language. if enunciation is declarative

- and one might consider an interpolated enunciation here as a shifter -

then action is performative - and it is echo, world-constituting language,

that becomes deeply problematic, in the sense that it is _separated from

intention, from speaker, from source_ - it is an emission above and within

the _face of the world, its alterity,_ within which it resides.

>>one might think of these languagings as modal; in which case echo 

references the foucauldian _divinatio,_ but only as index; in fact, echo 

is _in fact,_ the construal of the world as-if (vaihinger, bentham) there 

is no presencing, no intentional, no actor, no agency. in another similar 

sense, echo is the call of a shell command from a perl script; it is 

ulterior, an existential alterity, legible, readable, or not.<<



>>thus i call my book .echo, which acts subtly towards the material

completion of a constituted world, however fragile, however thinned (down

to the width of a pixel), .echo which reflects, not narcissus, but the

very grain of the separated and dismembered voice.<<
