Forensic i (form of bad murmur)


I work from memory of myself. I work from homicide books, memories of
bodies, shoot-outs, wars that give me nightmares. I work from screams,
women thrown down stairs, women with arms broken, crying slapped chil-
dren. I work from disrupted dreams of killing fields I have never seen.  
I work from the precipice, where all good boys and girls huddle, high and
violent above the smouldering earth. Jennifer emerges from my side, teeth
bared, her nails slashing uselessly against the sky. Any emergence in my
world is a letting of blood, a bath of hurtled bullets, escapades of
flayed flesh, everything wetting to the touch. Jennifer rides the wave of
the millennium, we're in Jennifer, and this is a missive, within to with-
out, within without to within. Because we're absorbed in the alcohol of
the unaccountable, seepages across ontologies; the person next to you
stares with your eyes like a total stranger. I dissect the real; I am
Jennifer's arm and scalpel. If her nails won't do. If she can't write. If
she doesn't care.
