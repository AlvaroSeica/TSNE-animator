[Yes]

Oh oh oh I am so relieved. For a moment I thought you were aborting me.
For a moment I thought I was dead. For a moment I thought the operation
was cancelled. For a moment I thought I'd lost my status. For a moment I
feared an interruption. For a moment I thought you'd erase me from your
memory. For a moment I thought you'd work on that. Then and only then did
you beg me to go ahead. Then and only then did you feel the whip. Then and
only then did you fall apart. Then and only then were you smeared, defiled
down near the logos-ground. Then and only then did you grind the logos. I
was entranced, enchanted. I asked you, are you there. I whimpered, are you
there, the whip loose and trailing on the sodden earth. I thought you'd
never answer. I thought you wouldn't say a thing. You said yes, yes, you
did, you said yes.
