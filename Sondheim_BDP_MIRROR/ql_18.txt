6. inhabiting in real-time. Instrument and player inhabit real-time; so 
often in improvisation, for example, what occurs, occurs in an expanded 
present that appears horizonless, if it appears at all. Rather, there is 
the continuous doing and undoing of structure, remembrance of things past 
and subconscious projection of things future, which may or may not appear, 
as the dialog between instrument and player may take one elsewhere than 
what one has 'thought,' if such projections are of thought (and not, for 
example, of a pauseological nature) at all. (Pauseological: subterranean 
structure not yet 'filled' or fulfilled, a basic concept in enunciation.)
