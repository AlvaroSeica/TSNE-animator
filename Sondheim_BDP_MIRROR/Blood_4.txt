Logic, Nyaya-Manjari (Jayanta Bhatta), from Ahnika I (first section):


5. Let the discerning wise people take their bath in this great flowing
river of Sarasvati which ardenlty flows into the stream of Aksapada's
logic. 

6. We make an appeal to the great scholars to the effect that they may
look kindly upon this work by a mere peep at it though their mind is
fatigued, being in constant touch with the great works displaying wonder-
ful skill in depicting matters of wide interst and arousing strong emo-
tion. 

7. I have culled this essential herb from the wild garden of herbs of
logic and have churned this lump of butter from the milk of Logic of
Aksapada. 

8. We claim no originality of thinking to discover new truth but have 
fascinating style to express the old ones in an attractive form. Let the 
critics examine it for themselves.

9. The very flowers by which garlands have been repeatedly prepared arouse
curiosity even in the mind of those wearers of garlands when they consti-
tute a new garland, being arranged in a new order. 

10. The good men appreciate even a work of little worth presented to them 
since they are unaware of turning down the request of a supplicant.

11. Let the great savants of learning who are about to enjoy sportive walk
in the garden of words adoen their ears with this (Nyayamanjari) new
blossom of logic. 

12. The tree of logic, planted by the great sage - Aksapada, has grown in
its bulk and is bent under the burden of its fruits of thick juice tasting
like nectar.

13. I cannot climb up this tree because my powers are limited and hence 
it is further beyond my powers to test its merits in toto.

14. I take pains only to discuss some selected topics of this great work.
