Jennifer's notes


When I return from Nova Scotia, the Aurora will be a memory; already, I am
beginning to forget the Desert Fox, which may or may not be docked now at
the piers. These boats will ply without horizon and on thick days with
magnetic storms, I can imagine them haunting my dreams, present because
there is no reason not to be, the hulls up close, black and blank screens
drowning out, like seamen, every other thought.

...

We were going to swim naked out to the Desert Fox, like Navy frogmen; we
had to attach something to the hull, leave our mark. Scouring the house, I
found only refrigerator magnets. Still, these are sufficient for a signa-
ture, submerged, invisible, too small to affect the world.

...

In New York, freighters will again be texts, words, shifters, tokens. City
noise drown identity, turns it into ideological strategy, manageriality.
What is thought through, thoroughly, are the words, speaking and writing
as forms of expulsion.

...

In New York, the words are father and mother; their function is the work
of play. Think of roles while a foghorn sounds, _now,_ in the distance.

What is a sound that it is substance and not signal or index.
