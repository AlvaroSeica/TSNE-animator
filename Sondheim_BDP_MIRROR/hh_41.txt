My Files on My Nice-Machine:


A file that erases itself, then returns in a new incarnation.
A file that returns and erases its compiler.
A file that turns off the mother lode, refuses perl's advances.
A file that stupidly repeats: cg I-bin there.
A file that sends a cookie to your machine so you'll never see the beauty
page again.
A file that disappears, leaving a sad announcement sent to every member of
an email list, the long goodbye.
A file that states this is the last message you'll ever see and means it.
A file that appends its word count, repeats the operation going for the
big one.
A file that disappears without a trace, not even leaving its process id
number behind.
A file leaving nothing but its process id number as a memory of happy
enrichment deep within the kernel.
A file that forkbombs, spreading children far and wide, duplicates of
itself all activated, across the pebbled landscape of the computer.
A file that repeats everything it can find out about you.
A file that repeats everything it knows about you, nothing.
A file that randomly dances the long goodbye to fellow users on your
server.
A file that announces this site's been seen by you and you alone.
A file greedy for your RAM, taking all you've got to offer, begging for
more.
A file automatically running Jennifer for Alan, generating this file
under the guise of running Alan for Jennifer.
