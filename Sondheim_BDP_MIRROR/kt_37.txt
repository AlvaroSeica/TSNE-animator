This is all the world we have. We will not have the world for long. We are
predisposed to see asymptotically into the future. Billions of years mean
nothing; we will open our eyes to billions of years in a single blink. We
will die thinking of billions of years. 

It is certain nothing will remain of this, nor of any of our information.
And for this reason, things cry, and will continue to cry. I place my head
on the ground, I place my head on its side, and I can hear the crying of
every little thing. For everything knows it will not last, not even a
stone or a pebble, not even an atom or a beauty-ray of blue-white light.

Everywhere I walk, I hear this weeping. Everything is bathed in blue-white
light and I know so much this atom which is crying very hard; it is a very
tiny atom and takes so very many days to fall to earth.
