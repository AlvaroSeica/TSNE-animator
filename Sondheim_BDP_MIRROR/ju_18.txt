   sometimes i dream of empty space what might be called the rail you know
    you might look inside and there would be an opening and you might know
     that you could enter into a very beautiful world and sometimes i know
    in the realm of the digital there is no space inbetween that, you know
   you might travel there and meet me but there is only non-void, you know
