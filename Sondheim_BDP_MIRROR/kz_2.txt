kyoto, why i can't live with myself in any world


even before the narrow streets and the river, before the wooden temples
loomed up darker in the cooler weather, even then, there was kyoto-moo;  
it was always there; i was sotatsu, a wizard, even before i saw his
paintings at the monastery then, shortly before we left; even then, i
looked in the river and saw the dancing of kabuki in my mind, i knew then,
it was nikuko dancing; i remember the lane by the river, the thin park
coming and going against the restaurants; nothing is forgotten, not the
double-seeing of the garden, not the new player class created by kayo
matsushita, not the ryokan; even before the ryokan, not the ryokan, and
even before the player class, not nikuko nor sotatsu; i remember kami-
gamo and the precise pass up the stone stairs and the wood-shrine and the
phallic stone and the dampness and wet moss backways there and the cor-
doned-off patch of dark earth, and the cones of sand; the small store with
the meiji kimono book of emblems and designs, and my time in japan on the
kyoto-moo coming to an end; so many times recently when i could not get
in, when sven travis the gaijin closed the site down and kyoto-moo disap-
peared forever with player class and gardens and ghosts, dim remnants of
sotatsu constructs
