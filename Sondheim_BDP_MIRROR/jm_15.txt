about death being a handled thing
about humanity hammering out a home
about insistence and drudgery 
about sweeping with a shot-broom
2
about those horse-killings down
there in the brambles
about extinctions things
with doubled chasm-heads, three-legs
1
about jennifers'ss pasting herself
in pies and strudels against docks
waterfowl biers in her transparent
head with burned watery quarks
0
boat-water round about these
blue parts fluorescent lemur
