Servo Servation


Sieh, die Maschine:                  See, the machine:
wie sie sich waelzt and raecht       how it wallows and wreaks revenge,
und uns entstellt und schwaecht.     distorts and weakens us.

Hat sie aus uns auch Kraft,          Though it has strength from us,
sie, ohne Leidenschaft,              let it, dispassionate,
treibe und diene.                    drive and serve.

(From Rilke, Sonnets to Orpheus, I, 18, trans. Norton.)

Pre-cybernetic, serve/servo in English, that is, following, slave, one
pitched in relation to the other, two translucent, bound - as well as mas-
ter/slave, a division between them, space of liminality. I wouldn't say
in-formal, but some might, _there._ In any case (where the world is), this
dis-passion or implication of non-cyborg, naught, as if fallen. Alterity
is _bound_ to the subaltern of the _thing,_ here, Kristevan Thing centered
on depression, absorption, our strength sapped, flaccid. Thus Part I the
history of Occidental thought, Part II through de Mettrie, human-machine
run like, because is, clockwork. Let it _go,_ viral in the world, bacter-
iophage articulated, particulate. The matrix, granularity, of the world, 
constructs alliance, allegiance; _nothing_ happens in the separation ex- 
cept the nineteenth century.
