The Water-Column





late at night, loneliness betrays itself

sad things find their uselessness

apart, the curtain parts 

the stage is an oval in another room

of wood

my arms remain and there is nothing

beyond my arms

i cannot cover the warmth of this bed

sprawled upon a dream in which you are

always awake and on that stage

of wood



i sprawl on the stage, there are layers 

of boards upon boards, curved inward,

blank center where double ovals lose 

sudden focus, absence of landmark, voice, 

arms or otherwise



late at night i beg you, watch me, i have 

no secrets, expose thin flesh every 

second, millimeter so you have no doubt

no doubt



but apart the oval harbors surety or

galleon where the body opens always and

ready on the side of the other 



now the oval is on a ship where 

planking is the word for boards and you 

watch me walk a length or plank where 

i arrive in you full of arms and

watching



i am wearing feathers and gold which

follow me into a mine deep within

the hold. here i meet soldiers and have

many fights.



adventures await she who seeks them

finding performances on the ship such

as king lear or cordelia wanted me to.



wounded, my sad arms grapple uselessly

behind my back, taking one another.



the sails are very large and the journey 

is wonderful, filled with wonderful storms

and fiery sunsets. two dark and crimson

birds follow the stern rising high above

steel waves only to sink down for several

stories, of the sea, no doubt i have told

you of the stage as well. my arms lie

beneath them.
