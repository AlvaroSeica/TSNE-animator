At the Big Film Show of the Real


Oh, I saw couples touching tenderly, eyes closed and limpid smiles on
  their faces;
and there were sleepers among them, during the Big Film Show of the Real -
and let us not forget those with hands over ears, too-loud sound roaring,
  muffled, and ill-conceived -
or those weaving in their chairs, hands over eyes, shuddering as sodden
  dreams and yawnings took them as well -
all in the hall of the Big Film Show of the Real -
projectors humming poorly in the background, speakers roaring before us -
splices chattering through the dirt and dust of the endless film,
  going nowhere like all the other films -
like all the other films in the Big Film Show of the Real -
oh! I'd be elsewhere, outside, in the foyer, downstairs, sidewalking
  in city streets, on riverbanks, down trenches, up mountains -
I'd be anywhere in the Real, anywhere at all! anywhere, except 
  at the Big Show with all the projectors and speakers
  hammering and yammering away, but then my neighbor said to me,
"Oh Oh new found friend! How could you be so naive, as to assume
  that outside you've found it all! the Real without the Big Show
  is the Reel without the Film - there isn't any!"
And I saw that she was right, and I returned gladly to my seat,
  allowed myself to fall asleep - 
Just you wait! I'll dream the Real in the Big Film Show of the Real!
