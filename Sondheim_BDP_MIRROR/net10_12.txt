This list is contaminated. This list is quarantined.
This section of cyberspace contains an unidentified disturbance. 
Difficulties with fleshmeet may result.
The following symptoms are indicative of potential disturbance:

Trembling and hysteria upon entering special characters at the command-
line prompt.
Hysterical cross-postings following by signs of obsessive-compulsive
feelings of incompletion.
Dreams of strangulation or suffocation following flame-war engagements.
Addictive behavior in relation to SCROLL in daily life; such behavior
includes a constant _nodding of the head_ as if from bottom to top of a
(non-existent) screen, attempts to freeze the environment, delete or
kill it, and attempts to place persons, objects, or landscapes in an
appropriate folder "for later study."
Lists of favorite gopher sites referred to as "pets" or "best friends."
Unconsummated email marriages, births, deaths, and divorces.

If a list is quarantined:

Enter it at your own risk. 
Remain on-line for short periods at best.
Type naked and reveal your deepest secrets; everyone will do the same.
Trust only in the voice and objects that remain constant in your hands.
Give yourself up to brittle beauty, forget and forgive the outer world.
Report it to no one, except the list-participants themselves.
