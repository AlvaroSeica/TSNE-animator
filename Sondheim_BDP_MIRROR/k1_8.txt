Heidegger


I'd rather be beautiful rather than nothing.
I'd rather be famous rather than nothing.
I'd prefer to have a lot of energy instead of being weak and onerous.
Why am I beautiful rather than otherwise?
Why am I famous, rather than a relative non-entity?
Why do I have heaps of energy, rather than collapsing?
I'd rather be alive than dead.
Why am I alive, rather than dead.
I'd prefer to be alive, rather than nothing.
Why am I living, instead of non-living?
Why am I this configuration of matter, rather than another?
I am this configuration writing these words, instead of any other.
I'd prefer to be this configuration, rather than nothing.
(Why am I near the end of the human, rather than near the beginning?
Why are there so many writings near the end of the human?
I'd rather be beautiful, rather than near the end of the human.
Near the end of the human, I'd rather be writing.)
