...of course the truth of the matter is that illumination comes with the
realization that _it makes absolutely no difference whatosever_ whether
or not the words are preordained, whether or not one operates by a pur-
ified volition, or if, in fact, everything is worked out from the begin-
ning. And with this illumination, the wall appears, obdurate, the other's
presence, the knowledge that there is barrier in any case. The _in any
case_ circumscribes existence itself, inscribes existence, a double-
writing in which the boundary creates an imaginary and inchoate presence
that will turn out to be the self, parcelled out within the wall, dis-
membered, with the memory of a totality that comes from the wall itself.
