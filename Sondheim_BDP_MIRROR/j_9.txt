The news is that the water wants to be the water. The news is that the 
water no longer touches the shores of the Harbor of New York. The news is 
that it wants to be the memory of the water, always plural in the Hebrew, 
always replete with water.

It had the memory of the water, the news goes on to say, that it wants to 
become again. It had the memory, the news goes on to say, that spread 
from shoal to shoal, reef to reef, vent to vent. It wanted to be the 
water again, that's all there was to it, the news went on to say.

All that the news had to say was that it remained off shore, that the 
water remained off shore. All the news said was that it had remembered 
and no longer wanted to be on shore at the Harbor of New York. All the 
news said was that it wanted to be the memory of the water.
