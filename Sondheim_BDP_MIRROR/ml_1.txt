3 protocols' commentaries


1 well this protocol drives everything. it's not a protocol, it's an 
association or mapping, it's a drive or production-number, it's a 
correspondence, it's built into the matrix of the inchoate, it's 
unintended, it's untended - [phenomenology of approach, the world]
membrane.mov or something that 'reflects' - in the antiquated diamat sense 
- the running and rummaging of the idiotic real -

2 well this protocol carries the codes, this protocol carries the message, 
this protocol is unintended, it's tended, it's maintained, someone 
maintains it, someone keeps it running, someone sends the message, someone 
hears it - [phenomenology of the world, the carrier, the interpretation, 
the interpretation of the carrier, the assignation] - there's mime.mov and 
mum.mov and think of the body as the carrier/transmission - the making of 
the cinematic of the mime - 

3 well this protocol's assigned on the run, this is the meaning-generator,
meaning-production, this assigns boundaries and bindings, this creates
language and negations, this runs it through - there's dirt inhabiting
this one, there's the noise in the machine, there's the interpretations,
the abjections, the sado-masochisms, the ideologies, histories - it's all
in this protocol - [phenomenology of approach, the complicit, the
seduction, the accompaniment, the comprehension, the deconstruction]
