				   ALARM


			they closed my MOO behind a firewall

			they butchered my talker

			they cut off my legs my tongue

			they refused my nightmares

			they killed my haven

			they plucked my lily from my navel

			they ripped out my umbilical cord

				ALARM! ALARM!

			they hung me near your eyes your ears

			they cut off my arms my hand

			they cauterized my directories

				ALARM! ALARM!

			the MOO grinds on grinds on

			the MOO screams loneliness and

			the empty atmospherics wail on Phaedra

			the world whirls away

			there's no uptime downtime logins logouts

				ALARM! ALARM!

			no email no *Online MOO lists bulletins

			no news no deaths no births

			they cut out my eyes my ears

			the split my head they killed me

			firewalls silence ALARMS

			I offer you my tits clattered to the floor

			I have no solutions I'm dead

			I have no MOO I'm dead

			not a house to live in

			not a container a thing an exit

			NOT EVEN AN EXIT

				ALARM! ALARM!

				ALARM! ALARM!
				
				ALARM! ALARM!
