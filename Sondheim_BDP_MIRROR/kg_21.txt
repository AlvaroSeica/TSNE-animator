On _Her_ Name


Writing on _her_ name. The name which is written on. Creased or soiled
name. Dirty dirty name.

Nikuko: Of the name-particle, particulate. Of the opposition or operation. 
Of the occupation, of a place or a name-place. The pinning of language to
the body. The degree of the pinning.

No longer Jennifer or Julu, no longer mobility, dispersion, no longer
splay. Longer splay. No longer actants, but this: Nikuko: the name. 
(Which enters the hole.)

Because the name is the beginning of the split and pole or polar of this
space. Because it is the pebble building domain-name IP address. Because
it spaces names. 

Because there doesn't always need to be any action. Because there need to
be more and more things. Because all of these things are absolutely nece-
ssary. Because the world builds up from them. 

Nikuko lets me borrow her whenever I want to.

Alan.
