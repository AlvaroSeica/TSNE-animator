	IN THE FUTURE EVERYONE WILL READ MY WORK
	IN THE FUTURE EVERYONE WILL SEARCH FOR MY TEXTS
	THE SMALLEST SCRAP OF PAPER WILL BE EARNESTLY POURED OVER
	EVERY TINY STEP I HAVE EVER TAKEN WILL BE DULY RECORDED
	IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO EXTRAPOLATE SOME STEPS 
	EVERYONE WHO HAS EVER KNOWN ME WILL TESTIFY
	EVERYONE WHO HAS EVER HEARD OF ME WILL TESTIFY
	MY LETTERS BOTH PAPER AND EMAIL WILL BE TREASURED FOREVER
	THE SLIGHTEST HINT OF AN APHORISM WILL RESULT IN PUBLICATION
	WHOLE VOLUMES WILL BE DEDICATED TO MY 'I AGREE' POSTS
	COLLECTIONS OF MY SAYINGS WILL BE TRADED LIKE PLAYING CARDS
	A CENTURY FROM NOW SOME FEW PEOPLE WILL BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND ME
	IN A FURTHER CENTURY MY THOUGHTS WILL HAVE BECOME COMMONPLACE
	MY NAME WILL HAVE BECOME A HOUSEHOLD WORD
	MY FRIENDS WILL HAVE ACHIEVED ALMOST HOLY STATUS
	MY ACQUAINTANCES WILL HAVE THEIR NAMES RECORDED FOREVER
	IN THE FUTURE MY FOLLOWERS WILL BE LEGION
	EVERYONE WILL KNOW MY FUTURE IN THE FUTURE
	EVERYONE WILL BE MY FUTURE
