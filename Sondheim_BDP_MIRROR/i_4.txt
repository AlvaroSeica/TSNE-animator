No Time to Say 





Travis _knew_ time didn't exist. He knew it the same way he knew the 

color of the stars outside the ship the color of the earth the day he was 

born. 



He knew that there was a slurry. That there were reports that kept 

accumulating. They always vectored one-way, that of increase. There was 

always increase and this was static and there was no time.



The increase could be organized and he'd think about that and then he'd 

look towards the vector but it would always be horizoned. This gave him 

hope and the hope was permanent. The horizon remained at exactly the same 

distance and always empty. That way.



There were premonitions but they showed up only in the increase. They 

were the latitude of the increase. This was static and skewed. 



There was no time but always already increase which seemed to him an

economy, seemed to him capital. He thought of it exactly as that: beneath

the sign of capital. 



He thought that the crisis of capital had something to do with death, 

which was always on the horizon, mute, shuffled. He knew there was no 

death but always already reports of it. The demise of capital.



He involved himself in the biblical tense, the collusion of tenses, and

thought of the project of tenses. He thought the project would permit the 

manifestation of the absence of time, a trace left from the future (all 

traces originate in the emissions of the future, always already), skewed 

towards the past, spread like an eddy or delta, because the past was 

always infinitely shallow, symbolic, and infinitely deep, imaginary.



Travis translated va-y'omer, the talking of it which was the doing of it, 

and he will talk and he said, will say, in the saying of it. Then thought,

saying:
