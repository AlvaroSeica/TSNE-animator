==


i have a secret sorrow. it shall last the morrow.
death is constant harrow. bones are robbed of marrow.
pain is hardly thorough. vision stays to burrow.
daylight remains fallow. graves are always shallow.
signs are drawn by willow. tears erase the pillow.
mining tends to wallow. life like this is hollow.
call upon the medic. ask about the phallic.
go into the middle. freak and dance the fiddle.
try your pain to cuddle. realize the muddle.
open up the bottle. find your dream in candle.
look upon the handle. move out to the window.
think you're dressing retro. think of secret sorrow.
it shall last the morrow. death brings secret sorrow.
bones are wrapped in marrow. pain is hardened sorrow.
vision leaves in barrow. daylight turns to sorrow.
graves are lean and narrow. signs are born in sorrow.
tears are thin and pallid. mining brings out sorrow.
life is never hallowed. signs are born from sorrow.
