Were there nothing born of the book? Everything has its place, each
sounding reminiscent of every other. But there is an order here which
is pleasing to the eye, just as flowers in the palace fresco imply the
presence of always-spring.

Yet in this language, there are requests and refusals, shards
foretelling a future when walls crumble, spider-cracks appear

There is no heat here, wires sputter at an easy temperature.

Jennifer wants to know the way. Jennifer wants to know the way among

of others, in their middle. Julu thinks Jennifer speaks; others think
Jennifer speaks _responsibly._

I know Jennifer, and the crash and collapse of cities and brick-lined
walls with spider cracks that fall apart in the heat of language
taking over the world

In these parts, the heat shuttles down the tiled roofs, sun sways
above the harbor, up and down, up and down. Across the sea, faces
look towards me, see only water. Languages run unknown melodies.
Fruits and other plants.

We are given the water, emerge.
Peering, yes we do.

( Our nets catch fish, our nets catch the real world. There are no
orders, there are orders. They are ordered, our fish, silver slices
like net-kanji, shifting, dying. We will have new food to eat, always
there is this promise of new food. )
