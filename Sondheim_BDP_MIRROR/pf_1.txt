The Trip


we begin our journey full of burning eagles,
harvesting the sun, I heard 
or rather eagles torching grass already dried, deformed
I heard someone say the sun, other laughed at moonlight
one might begin 'replete' thinking of mountains and these people
the shore receded from the shore, the shore overcame it
There were eagles and blackbirds. Someone saw a grey-brown fox.
like solid air. Oh the people leaned out and out of flat beds
that came for them. That always came for them. their hands
touched corpses in the hills.
howling in good grace. I said to my neighbor, The residue of 
the world is the residue. She said, you can always shuttle nouns
Or similar, among Trees there might be eld of yore. In any case
snow flew the mountains, birds flew the snow, we trundled
Here comes the eagle, there goes the eagle, 
now.


we begin our journey full of burning eagles,
harvesting the sun, I heard
absent in the ravished landscape of swollen pods
speaking of absence in the signs of absence harvested by sun
while others fought through desires. There were boats.
Only foxes lope, combining waves with solid heat
struggling nowhere any time in particular. Oh the people
shored themselves against the lurch, bark, aspen, rock, void
There were no bodies, here and there among them. There were
enemies and Satans. there were devils beneath the wheels
like that and arrive somewhere among equivalence you dare
not speak. I said the trees of the world are the Trees. 
She told me I cheated, as if trees and Trees were same.
along by shoreline's searing heat, we trundled,
now.

Gnat swarming behavior

The following video was made about 100 meters from the Jordan River trail 
in Salt Lake City (West Jordan / Midvale), Utah. The site is a pond per- 
haps one or two acres across; there are numerous birds (swallows, swifts, 
red-wing and yellow-head blackbirds, etc.) around. When I first saw the 
gnats, near sundown, they swarmed in a typical ellipsoidal fashion, i.e.
similar to a free-falling water balloon in slow motion. I noticed several 
columns forming; in a short while, they became vertical, long and narrow.
They swayed and held shape. In gnat swarms, males and females behave 
differently; in one of the vertical columns, a roughly spherical 'head' is 
visible to one side, and I wonder if there might be sexual differentiation 
here. What is fascinating to me is the relationship of millions of gnats 
to an over-arching geometry; this parallels slime mold behavior to some 
extent. I've seen lots of gnat swarms before, but nothing like this. We're 
leaving the Salt Lake City area today, so I have no time to investigate 
this further at the moment (we're leaving today), but I'm interested in 
any further input, images, videos, you might have.

Radio

'Radio' - modified recording in the Mormon Tabernacle Choir building; note 
the laptop in the foreground which controls and monitors the organ, light- 
ing, recording, etc., as far as I can tell.

mother i will make


mother i will make a solemn vow
to continue this line by line and couplet

we'll try to hold ourselves, twist these interiors
of bodies destined for their loss of sound or memory
of bodies destined for their lack of history

such is presence that whatever is effaced is lost in time
and disappears with my death, and not your own

mother you ride me, mother you penetrate my mind
skewered on creation of film, no birth of sound or screen

within a single window, whereupon now anyone
can restablish the empire of fouled thoughts

not absent history which implies another way
of shoring up against a multitude of presence

or your death, not mine, no matter how
someone watches and grants the gift of sight to you or me

mother, a mannequin could do no better, 
you have to understand
a mannequin could do no better

ravish

her eyes fall through her eyes, a thing is lashed
you find yourself hysteric, is she watching me
or something else next to the shuddered prims
so gaze against her gaze, nothing is ever lost
and play within her plays, whatever might be found
this might seemed worried, her mouth is berthing wide
no matter what bleak hardness or good however grace
or where the neural networks might be stashed
her eyes, uncanny, swollen, gaze across a sea
you're always swollen, harboring her whims
is clearly thing your flesh has neatly tossed
sodden emptied, sallow, on unhallowed ground
you fear the world, there's no thing more inside
no more than eyes cut through the hollow face

histoire. memoire.


life in this parts have been pretty good.
http://www.asondheim.org/histoire.mp4
good life has parted from me.
life has never been good.

you might think more about life if you knew how close i was to death.
i am a walking living death. i am welkin.
i will take my life out like a dog.
you will take your dog out to the desert beyond the desert.

they tackle my parasites and defeat me. my defeat strengthens me.
my defeat strengthens me to defeat me.
death, be my harbinger. an omen of omens, sign of signs.
kings of kings and queens of queens.

my body is run replete with something of no consequence.
i speak to you over the wires.
plates of glass and memories ta'en up and laid to rest.
i rescue you in bitterness for the gall and ferocity of life.

i will gouge my eyes out if you don't.
if you don't gouge out my eyes, i will.
if you don't gouge out your eyes, i will.
you will gouge out your eyes if i don't.

hello earth i am not dead i am not healthy. i am what you say.
life, you are a maelstrom to me.
i will put out my eyes and put out my life.

you will shoot it. then you will shoot yourself.
these words were spoken by a dead man a dead woman.
they live inside of me furiously.
i will defeat myself i will kill myself.

i will give a yes yes yes to life. i will give nothing up to death.
you can see death in their eyes. you can see eyes.
sometimes you wake up and you think; eyes are all i see.
a world of eyes watching death, cultivating the garden of death.

the wires burn; there is the smell of burning flesh.
burning flesh, wires, photography and photography's plates.
running everywhere but where.
the fireflies light up the sightless nighttime sky.



two short male mov(I)es

( equations of form y = sqrt(tan(a-b*x^2), a and b constants )

usual scattered geometricized grid as equation collapses from below,
also from above, given the specific style of the display.

nothing can be obtained from this except the equations are soaked.

here is one version of the linear male collapsing when faced with 
the real.

http://www.asondheim.org/jet6.mov squIrt

perhaps phallocentric, certain the axis scattering
what otherwise would harden itself against any potential, well,
bound by equations, restoration.
so when the continuing stream is examined closely, beyond
the artificial repetition of the loop, the turbulence that results
conjures up an inexhaustible universe.
here is one version of the male dynamo fucking the stars.

the softness of the world

whew, something should spill this over-inflated production i can assume 
swallows the gullet into some incandescent lunge. yes, of course death is 
the boundary and the barrier, and what passes through carries information 
out and into the black hole where everything was once thought lost, now in 
this incandescent world, there is the potential for survival, something 
new literally within the galaxy, not under the sun. as if such might awak= 
en themselves, manifest to the world. their incandescent arches calling 
human worlds and phenomena to them, in a form of irretrievable and eternal 
data-banking. oh yes, and oh, just imagine the possibility of all of this, 
all human information, nay, the very soft and sumptuous knowledge we have 
accumulated beneath the incandescent sun which waits to survey our 
innermost thoughts.

surely there are more throbs than gristle, more roughage than equipment 
designated the production of fences or other appurtenances designed to 
forestall incandescent death. the sun in its incandescent raiment harbors 
nothing, but exploration has indicated that its incandescent protrusions 
are heavily structured, and one might imagine them carrying some semblance 
of intelligence. but doesn't this depend on literal firewalls against such 
incandescent sparkings, set off in an illimitable universe. but these are 
not, are never, thoughts, how could thoughts exist in an incandescent 
state; surely i can argue that such surveyance readily accomplishes the 
fecund description of worlds, cosmos, everything that was and everything 
that will be.

and so far as just around the corner, billowing knowledge, the hidden face 
of things which continues to reveal, against the softest of orderings of 
the real; when someone dies, whole worlds and skeins, membranes of poten- 
tial objects, histories, memories, disappear, this is an incontrovertible 
lack from which there is no return, no recompense.

it is such softness you might imagine that constitutes thinking, the 
settling-in of forms and formlessness, the appearance of the infinite in 
the projection of the finite, the knowledge that something, anything, 
everything, is just around the corner.

which is why the sun and its garnering is of such vital importance, and 
illuminaries that caress, that do not burn ...

that caress, these softest of times ...



Billowing and sovereignty


(From a letter) " - sometime would like to talk to you about this notion, 
the 'smoothed' lifeworld and the 'peering' around corners that I think 
constitutes memory and suturing - almost a form of billowing - I think 
this could be a useful concept for me. softness embraces both mental 
phenomena, mind, and the receiving, receptacle, organizing of things, 
identifying of things, surrounding of things, in the personal world and 
its extension, i.e. the 'peering' of the personal world. it's difficult to 
come to grips with the 'depth' of the real, that lip when classification 
is just beginning or just forgotten - when the real seems of a comfort, 
presencing ... "

in billowing, the particulate disappears. stratigraphy loses the anecdote 
among the sublime. neither singular nor plural. nor something revealed - 
it would be easy, yes, to think through the sublime as a matter of revela- 
tion, next stop on the mystical train. but there's no vector, no plateau, 
no buddhas seated or otherwise, no intentional or contradictory language.

the particular is the particular is asthmatic, urban dis-ease, the body at 
war, not with itself, but with differentiation. towards death distinctions 
disappear. there is no other side.

"MR. KING [said] [...] The States were not 'Sovereigns' in the sense 
contended for by some. They did not possess the peculiar features of 
sovereignty, they could not make war, nor peace, nor alliances nor 
treaties. Considering them as political Beings, they were dumb, for they 
could not speak to any foreign Sovereign whatever. They were deaf, for 
they could not hear any propositions from such Sovereign. They had not 
even the organs or faculties of defence or offence, for they could not of 
themselves raise crops, or equip vessels, for war." [...]

"MR. MARTIN, said he considered that the separation from G.B. placed the 
13 States in a state of Nature towards each other; that they would have 
remained in that state till this time, but for the confederation" [...]

(from Notes of Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787 reported by James 
Madison)

in a state of nature States jostle, states and operators jostle, processes 
jostle. nothing speaks unless spoken-to, when something speaking is speak- 
ing as spoken-for. from such collusion, collocations, rights arise through 
the etic; the emic, interiority, withdraws so that the membrane cloaks 
everything except digital transmissions - goods, speech, currencies, move- 
ment of men, materiel. in a state of nature, States billow forth, swell, 
breathe, engender, Mona Lisa smile.

are songs sung? look, I'm putting forward a myth, not of origins nor of 
destinations, a myth of wayfarers, neither mapped nor mapping nor nomadic. 
look, I'm writing to you, here, see, in the absolute silence of protocols, 
which, along of all the things, processes, states, and operators, are 
soundless in the world. 

look, she said, did we ever have a government.

death's


I am a sick man. I am a vile man. I think about death too much. I harbor
death. Here is a nonexistent image of the harboring of death:
http://www.asondheim.org/harboring.jpg

That won't do. That will never do. Death has a motion. Death has a motion
_from the other side._ Here is a nonexistent film of the motion of death:
http://www.asondheim.org/deathmotion.jpg

That's insufficient. That's never enough. Death is the refutation of all.
Death terminates infinitude. Here is death's nonexistent refutation of the
paradoxes of mathematics:
http://www.asondheim.org/refutation.txt

That can't count enough. That's never enough. Death devours data-base and
protocol. Here is a nonexistent indexing of death's world and universe:
http://www.asondheim.org/index.html

Death counters me. Death encounters me. Death stymies, subverts. I dream
death's dream. Here is a nonexistent presentation of death's dreaming:
http://www.asondheim.org/deathdream.pdf

Death's dreaming which is never enough. Death motivates me. I succumb to
death's motivation. I am swallowed by death. Death gives me a choice which
is no choice at all. Here is a nonexistent program of death's stricture, of
death's interface, of my collapse of death:
http://www.asondheim.org/deathcollapse.exe

Death muddles me. Death confuses me. Death take me. Death hold me. Here is
a nonexistent program of death's holding and taking:
http://www.asondheim.org/holdingtaking.pl

It's too confusing. Death rushes me, annihilates me. I will death's
annihilation. Yet does death listen. Nor does death listen. Here is a
nonexistent configuration of death's silence:
http://www.asondheim.org/silence.ini

It's too noisy. Death crushes me, lacerates me. Death has no bell, no drum,
no whistle. Death writes this. Here is a nonexistent file of death's grip,
death's claw, death's blood, death's bone, my grip, my claw, my blood, my
bone:
http://www.asondheim.org/placespace

It's too absent. It begs presence from death. It begs a missive. Here is the
nonexistent missive:

Some Notes on Language


"The answer is this: war on totality, Let us attest to the unpresentable; 
let us activate the differends and save the honor of the name." (Jean- 
Francois Lyotard, The Postmodern Explained.)

Watching early silent Shakespearian films on Turner Classic Movies - the 
linguistic register transforms into (visual) protolanguage; protolanguage 
can literally trace the visible. the earlier films (1899 - maybe 1908) 
tend towards special effects constructed as if for the first time; pre- 
sence is transformed and protolanguage gives way to wonder.

Agehananda Bharati writes on 'intentional language' in The Tantric Tradi- 
tion - this is considered a mistranslation of samdha-bhasa by Alex Wayman 
in The Buddhist Tantras: Light on Indo-Tibetan Esotericism; he translates 
the same as 'twilight language' as the 'climactics' between darkness and 
light. The ambiguity that arises is described by Nagarjuna in his Samdhi- 
bhasa-jika who gives such examples as "is the ambrosia (amrta) of heaven, 
to be drunk continuously." "is wind, is food, to be controlled." "One 
should be convinced, 'these very bones of mine are my ornaments.'" "is 
inhalation; and one should stop it from its violent acts." "has avikalpa 
nature; also, while the wind is being inhaled there is no recitation."

Wayman states "The twilights symbolized the sensitive points in the 
temporal flow when spiritual victory was possible. A special vocabulary 
was created to refer to these critical points and called in the Buddhist 
Tantras 'twilight language.'" "Nagarjuna's commentary suggests that the 
Hevajratantra has given the basic list of 'twilight language.' These are 
expressions for ambiguous yoga states, while 'non-twilight language' 
refers to states of yoga that are not ambiguous." In English, the phrases 
themselves are ambiguous and it's not clear whether the ambiguity 
parallels or is equivalent to the ambiguity in the original. It's not 
clear where the original lies. The ambiguity in English refuses to resolve 
and it is this refusal that constructs an alliance with the inert. The 
inert collapses whereas 'intentional language' retains mind. The collapse 
is the mirror of the protolanguage of early Shakespearian silent film.

Nagarjuna, in his Letter to King Gautamiputra ("The Letter of a Friend") 
states (in relation to the suffering of gods re: samsara):

"Their bodies' complexion becomes ugly, they do not like to sit, their 
garlands of flowers wither, their clothes become soiled, and sweat appears 
on their bodies - (all of which) never happened before. Just as on earth 
the signs of dying foretell man's approaching death, so these five former 
signs presage the death and transmigration of the gods dwelling in 
heaven." 

The summarization of the commentaries states:

"As the signs of death come to human beings, so do they come to gods. When 
the time comes for a god to die, these five signs appear.
(1) Though they are usually very beautiful, they lose their great beauty 
and become very ugly.
(2) Though they are ordinarily never bored because of their many pleas- 
ures, they become bored and do not know what to do. [...]"

(Venerable Lozang Jamspal, Venerable Ngawang Samten Chophel, Peter Della 
Santina, translating/editing; the original commentaries by Jetsun Rendawa 
Shonnu Lodo, the Venerable Lozang Jinpa and the Venerable Rongton Sheja 
Kunrig.)

Gods are bored, besides themselves. They're wandering, useless, used up, 
non-intended, not having paid sufficient attention to religious matter. 
One might say they're neither here nor there, they drain twilight language 
of the climactic. I'd say they're speechless, that their speech is of no 
consequence, that they inhabit the silence of the silent film. If speech 
participates in representation, digital division between that=which-is and 
that-which=is-not, then the gods move into the analogic inert, just as 
language becomes nothing whatsoever, and the climactic transforms into 
that global warming annihilating all life, reincarnation karma-dharma or 
not. Doesn't rebirth require a certain temperature bandwidth, between the 
frozen and the plasma? What's happening here? Nothing's happening.



Tantric Code Language 


bhagavan aha/
kollaire tthia bola mummunire kakkola
ghana kibida ho vajjai karune kiai na rola//(6)
tahi baru khajjai gade maana pijjai
hale kalinjara paniai dunduru tahi vajjiai//(7)

    Bhagavan replied: O! the Bola is located at Kollagiri, the Kakkola at 
Mummuni. The hand-drum is sounded forcefully; Compassion is affected, not 
discord. Here we eat meat and drink liquor in large quantities. Hey! Here 
the worthy ones enter, the unworthy ones are barred. We bring faeces, 
urine, menstrual blood and semen. Here we eat herbs and human flesh with 
relish. We move to and fro without consideration of pure or impure. 
Adorning our limbs with bone-ornaments, here we enter the corpse.
    In the meeting we perform the sexual union; the untouchable is not 
rejected here.

-- The Concealed Essence of the Hevajara Tantra with the Commentary 
Yogaratnamala, G.W.. Farrow and I. Menon, trans., II, 4, Seals

From the Yogaratnamala Commentary:
kollai (Kollagiri): Refers to the Pitha (shrine) of that name.
mummuni: Refers to the Ksetra of that name.
bola ... kakkola (male sexual organ ... female sexual organ): Indicates 
the meeting, although they are initially apart, of the yogi and yogini who 
are characterized by these two organs respectively.
kibida (hand-drum): Is the code word for the hand-drum.

Farrow and Menon:
kakkola - code word for the female sexual organ
bola - code work for Vajra, the male sexual organ
sandhyabhasa: Tantric Code Language. As examples of sandhyabhasa, the 
Hevajra Tantra lists about twenty code words. In the Candrakirti's 
Pradipodyotana commentary on Guhyasamaja Tantra sandhyabhasa is one of the 
sex ways by which the contents of the tantra are interpreted. The Carya 
songs of the Mahassidhas are mostly couched in code lnaguage. [...] This 
code system has been discussed by various eminent scholars. Many of the 
discussions have been based on the mistranslation of the word sandhyabhasa 
and what constitutes instances of sandhyabhasa. In our opinion too much of 
little consequence has been written on this subject.

[Sandhyabhasa is intrinsically clear; the authors' use of 'system' in the 
definition above, is not. I'd like to think that sandhyabhasa mostly moves
from inscription to abjection; all of this might well be lost in the 
descent to English.]

Alex Wayman:
kunduru (resin) - union of the two
kakkola (perfume) - lotus
dindima (small drum) - untouchable

Agehannanda Bharati:
bola(ka) (Tib. bo la) 'gum myrrh' (a) -> vajra (Tib. rdo rje) 'the 
Absolute'
kakkola(ka) (Tib. kakko la) n.p. of an aromatic plant, and of the perfume 
made from the plant (a) -> padma (Tib. padma) 'lotus'

Bharati quoting Shahidullah from his edition of the Dohakosa and the 
caryas:
padma 'lotus' -> (e) bhaga 'vulva'
vajra 'thunderbolt', the absolute (e) -> linga 'phallus'

Bharati quoting Eliade:
vajra 'thunderbolt' -> linga, sunya 'voidness,' 'the void,' vacuite

It's July 13 going on July 14 2007. Today I did absolutely nothing. I ate 
some grapes and played harmonica terribly. Last night I had a panic 
attack, that was a mess; I checked out the symptoms on the net and that 
was good enough for me. My heartrate was only 80 but my chest was tight 
and pounding. Today I found out my triglycerides are down to 220 and 
cholesterol at 199 which is okay. I read two versions of the Hevajra- 
tantra, Sanskrit and Chinese, in translation and answered an inquiry from 
Christie's who wanted me to redo the jpegs of the Koran under 600k and 
they couldn't open any of them with the URL until I sent them under 600k 
as attachments. I watched too much soccer, Bolivia beaten by Brazil in 
1997 Copa Americas - Brazil was playing dirty but with a final score of 
3-1 no one could argue. This is already badly written. Maybe it's Copa 
America. I finally understand football (soccer) offsides. Went with Azure 
and a friend back to the Tibetan shop for two more tantric works. Slept on 
and off all day because the panic attacked basically wrecked me; I haven't 
been able to do much else. I've had these attacks rather frequently in the 
past couple of weeks as I try to figure out my futureless future. The lock 
broke on our inner door in the building and I traded four bags of books 
for $56 as well as the Encyclopedia of New York, an Erle Stanley Gardner 
novel, and yet another book on things cyberspatial. Albert Ayler was on 
the radio and I heard a rumor that he was murdered back then. It would 
have been his 71st birth- day. I took a photograph with my Canon and the 
24mm lens - the inside of a cafe. Found out that Flatbush meant a wooded 
plain in the original or something like that. I've been thinking about 
intentional language but doing nothing about it. The net said, well some- 
thing I read said that panic attacks can be accompanied by overwhelming 
feelings of devastation and doom. I'm waiting for the arrival of a Canon 
8.1 megapixel A630 camera which might bring me needed resolution over my 
Sony FSC-717 which has only 5.1. The Canon doesn't have image stabiliza- 
tion. I've been using the Sony with full manual, including ISO. I'm 
thinking more about Thomas Ward, who wrote in 1842 under Flaccus. The 
place is far too humid and I looked at a brochure of Pocono homes. I had 
Turkish coffee at lunch with Azure and my friend; we talked about reincar- 
nation and ontological shifts. I've wanted to do something creative, and 
you might think this is it, writing through the back door, so to speak, 
but it's not. This morning I had to turn Bush's voice off the radio. I 
think it might be a different model name than FSC-717. I realized I like 
Roxy Music and traded a book on the evolution of invertebrates into the 
second-hand bookstore, as well as a book on nuthatches. I gave the cat a 
long pet; we've been worried about her after her third operation. I don't 
understand the excitement over Beckham; it didn't work with Pele, or 
rather worked for a little while, that's all. More soldiers and some Iraqi 
policemen died today; it was on the radio. I also don't understand the 
Regency period. I've got to work on our dance performance stuff - Foofwa's 
publicity materials arrived two days ago. The mail today brought abso- 
lutely nothing. I don't understand Will Ferrell or that kind of slapstick. 
I was able to write something more for Sue on cyberstuff and the wilder- 
ness and answered another interview question about the music I did in the 
60s. The cat's trying to drink my coffee. Feeling guilty about not working 
enough on Leonardo; I'm having a hard time concentrating. I'm sad about 
trading or selling off books but we're heavily in debt. My new HIP doctor 
called today about the sleep clinic; she seems terrific. The old one lit- 
erally disappeared. I read some more in Delacroix' journals. Coffee is 
great. I kept waking up in the middle of the night; it was miserable. 
There was a dream of connectors coming apart and together on the side of 
something. I weigh 162 again, far too much, it's depression or stress or 
lack of sleep. Soccer is my meditation savior. I'd work for a while and 
then sleep and then wake up unbelievably frightened with my chest cold and 
tight, my heart pounding, my arms trembling. I think this is why I did 
nothing today, and my harmonica playing was awful; I'm in no shape for 
doing anything. We're trying to get the cat to eat more.


sut

i wish to make obeisance to the four realms and ten directions
on my own time in my own way and not to make obeisance

i wish to make mistakes and errors on my own only reading from
the texts and writing in and out of others

i confuse hells and heavens and bodhisattvas and arhats and wish
to confuse them with sakyamuni and manjusri with others

i do not wish to listen to others speaking or teaching or others
proclaiming enlightenment or cessation of suffering

there is no cessation of suffering no path no bliss i do not wish
to attempt the impossible inhabit the inconceivable

i wish to comprehend my own way of dependent origination without
reincarnation or epistemic shifts leading to ontological error

i shall understand my truth as the truth which is the void and
i will not study the voice of the other and her proclamation

i will comprehend the twilight the coded the intentional
languaging of hevajratantra on my own in the midst of craving

i wish to celebrate ties to feces or urine or menses or dead
flesh glory in them with five yoginis on my own furious determination

i wish to hear no teacher see no teacher pay obeisance to no
teacher in this realm or in my furious rebirths i shall stay behind

i shall not adopt a walking meditation sitting meditation shall
not adopt bardo whispers dead men and women hearing

i will not sit and concentrate and not concentrate on point or no
point or no thing or void nor shall i concentrate on no void

nor shall i not concentrate nor shall i sit i will embrace hells
on my own furious terms vajra cutting lotus cutting through hells

i will discover everything and nothing on my own and that will be
an innovation and not be an innovation but quickly and thoughtless

i will not learn from any living being nor will i learn within a
room garnered or occupied by any living being nor will i learn

i will not say mantra there is no mantra no sound nothing to say
but what one would say in all day talk among sentient beings

i do not for a moment believe in spirit or reincarnation i do not
need nor do i want miracle i am fearful of death i embrace fear

there is no soul no self i will make mistakes i will congregate in
error i will whisper and write error error shall not be mine

of error it may be said there is no concourse there is permanence
and annihilation and my middle way veers between them i will say that

of life there are no beginnings and births and deaths of matter and
fecundity of animals and plants there are none

i will say there is no time to be reborn and no rebearing and nothing
of matter to be reborn and matter is of no bearing

i will smear my skin and hair with error smear my mouth and eyes with
mistake upon mistake and they will not be my own but not others

i will fuck furiously others and others semen flowing rivers streams
and speeds of meditation and conjoining

there will be no grace here and no falling and no sins or wages of
such that are paid and no moment of leaving and arriving

i admit no emanations

Talking to myself


I used to be able to talk to myself.
Now I can't talk to myself.
I can't talk to myself one on two.
I can't talk to myself two on one.
I used to be able to write to myself.
Now I am writing to myself one on one.
Now I am writing this, you are reading this.
But you are not two, you are not here too.
I was writing this, you are reading, this, etc.
You were reading this, I was writing this, etc.
Read and write, it's all the same, there's no difference.
But I used to be able to talk to myself, and now I can't.
