More on Protolanguage and Keystrokes


Labor: Keystrokes devolving into protolanguage, language of gesture -
these are the signs of occurrences. So that you are witness of animal
scurrying, organism responding to cue. Look, search, enter, continue. It
is difficult from outside (the labor, the keystroke) to comprehend the
mentality at work: riding the cue in silence or a quasi-determinative
approach to speech and phenomena. Consciousness muted. Impulse, the up-
welling of revolution in poetic language.

For the organism, there are bundles of associations; because of the re-
sponse nature of protolanguage, the texts are tied to occasions. There is
nothing to generalize - on the other hand, there are dual terms - those
derived from the imminence of the occasion ("iGirl" as in "look iGirl")
and those which derived from universals or control factors. The latter are
view in number: "look," "take," "put," "say," "go," while the former are
theoretically infinite. Even verbs may be imminent: "You may drink from
the cup of coffee" leading to "drink cup."

Categories slide into and through categories, metonymies through literal
strings and back again. The container for the thing contained, the speech
for the speaker, the sign for the cause. 

Or again: Think of keystrokes as diacritical marks to internal language
and thought, catalytic, potentials controlling behavior and semantics.
There is no distinction between typing "ls" for a directory listing and
"lass" in a Border poem; both are marks, demarcations, moments of finger
movement, the sound of keys clattering. Where is the machine when "ls" is
typed? Here, it is within an edit program - there, it is at a prompt.
"lass" may be a young girl here, and at the prompt, a misspelling for
"less," a text-reading program in unix or linux.

In any case, as I write repeatedly, it's the labor which is recorded, the
labor of the user, and the implicit response of the machine, generating or
resulting in further recording. One might think of "ls" as repetitive
directory listing, "e" as repetitive vowel striking - or "e" may be a
macro at a prompt or within a menu.

It is the repetition which is most evident, and what I can only call a
thwarted repetition at that, eliciting the horizon of substance, turning
towards quantity from quality. Even here, with this furious typing, it's
death which stalks the keyboard, never from within. The silence is never
noted.

sometimes you could see the shadows of the trees
  on the trees
in the summer the smell of the grass, the water
heat of boards on the dock, the boat

voices rising and falling
sound come forth from far across the water
sound come towards me, dim boat
  rocking hard beneath the surface
  where the voices are stilled

the lake, the lake

later, rising from the water, we'd, drowned,
  trees hearing us
dock boards drying in the sun
  no signs of our summers and deaths

you know who i are. you know what i have done to them. i'm talking to you,
i know what you mean. i know what they've done to us. you don't need to
name names. the lakes and the rivers have been taken away; our lives no
longer belong to us - they belong to them. in these dark times, we must
beware; we can't be too careful. the future won't be ours, unless we am
wary at all times. i must look behind my back, rather in front of my back
(applause); they're always sneaking up. they'll hack into my life. they'll
take away my wife and my children. they'll devour you. you want to give
myself to i but how can i, when they're watching? what can they see? what
am i doing? they're unreadable, unapproachable. their language, if they
have any. i know what i'm referring to. they make the very atmosphere
poisonous around here. you can't breathe near them - it's almost a scent
they have. they see the world differently, you'd be amazed how much. we
have to arm. they'll remain nameless here - that should tell i something.
if i don't think you know what i'm talking about, read the newspapers,
magazines - watch my television, radio - look and listen for the signs -
they're everywhere - it's written all over this world of ours - they've
probably taken it to other worlds - above the oceans, beneath the seas. i
can't go anywhere without running into them, they're controlling you.
watch my step - i know whose steps they really are. they own the cities
and the countryside; they're like vermin, you don't need to name names.
it's a shame what they're doing to us, taking everything away from us.
we've got to be careful here. it's our right to fight back, to protect
ourselves. you can't even tell i how long this has been going on, as long
as anyone's been around. there's a certain danger in the air. they'll
betray i at the blink of an eye - they're like viruses, just when i least
expect, like cancers, they invade from within - i know who you mean. watch
your back, that's all i can say. they're watching your back. (applause)

shaved bodies are perfect bodies, fish through atmosphere, entering heaven
unblemished, the 'h' in heaven was not that word in that phrase, i do not
remember that phrase, help me heal in our comfort, in our agitation, in
our horizon where people and buildings topple, in our new and in our old,
my dead words have no comfort, no comfort now, there was a moment, i re-
member beginning with 'h' and i am sure of 'h' and the rest now gone,
tracked down in the churned valley, lost in dirt, devouring, last night i
lost a phrase, it had comforted me close to sleep, i slept crying, think-
ing of illness towards death, this phrase had the power to heal, please
help recover, last read word and understood, last read word and understood
Your miseries last things are above my hanged last things Your last_word
destroys my last things!

 you are, in every shape of the world
oh mother oh father, when my eyes are open,
 you are spanned by emptiness, invisible,

names hold nothing when my eyes are open
names hold everything, pressed against my skull

End-Using, Hacking, and Who shall Save Our World

zz template

I am an end-user on this machine. The screen, rectangular, running Windows
CE, remains in the guise of a wall; there is nothing behind it, nothing
but pure signifiers arraigned across a surface. You may be sure of this; I
have no knowledge of interiors, my own or my machines - but the quality of
surface is more than sufficient for thought.

It is this thought I espouse, disconnected, self-organizing, streaming in-
to language, stuttering forward. It is the thought, not of superstructure
nor sub-structure, but of contiguity or residue; it is the presence of
signs across dark matter, language at the end of time. The machine offers
itself to me in the form of processes, potentials, keyboard strokes; all
occurrences are equivalent, all motion concatenated, coupled, the result
of ordinary effort in everyday life.

An end-user, I see the machine, this machine, as closure or foreclosure,
cutting across the mechanisms of production, working out of mystifica-
tion, towards an uncanny semantics. I'm thinking to myself here, the
screen passively recording everything, the applications placed within the
most comfortable and safe potential wells imaginable. This is the appli-
ance model of computers - there is nothing beyond or beside the end-user,
no hacking community, no interiorities or internal rearrangements. Every-
thing that I use is always already pre-given, adjusted through jostling, a
guest at the table employing proper etiquette.

With the end-user, it is always a matter of etiquette, a user whose ends
are met and determined by others, a degree of politeness, the case
remaining on the machine, the screen and thought intact. For the end-user,
there is no ontological jump between thought and language, subjectivity
and inscription; effortlessly, they feed into each other. This is a world
with genre, coherent diegesis, a world without diacritical marks, a world
which needs no guidance.

The end-user is death, energy flooding established channels. The world may
be disavowed or destroyed - worlds may be created, but the tool remains a
tool precisely because it is invisible, part and parcel of everyday life,
neither a question nor an answer. Think of the neutrality of the real, and
you have the mundane portrait of the end-user, the only conceivable port-
rait, greyed-out, invisible as well, just as all mediations are invisible,
the permanency of the real.

There is no discrimination, no bandwidth, no tolerance. There is no prob-
lematic: this describes the exterior. From within, no within, surfaces and
that greyness. From without, nothing as well. The end-user is part of the
deepest transparency, without refraction; nothing passes on the periphery.
This is also a matter of the vacuum, the vacuum of matter, inhaling.

You will say, but what of the end-user's knowledge, all that shape-riding.
I will reply, shape-riding without ontology is empty; the therapeutic has
no bearings in epistemology. For what is the extension of an arm, if what
is grasped mirrors one's own face? Better to have kept hands carefully at
one's side, better to have prepared for the defense of knowledge than the
mining of viral entries. What lies beneath the surface can only undermine
discourse; a virus never replies.

They will say, but the machines are silent and running. I will reply,
silent, running leaves no trace; the path is difficult; without trace
there is only loss; with loss, there is the loss of trace itself. For the
path puts pressure on the ground; the Ground becomes a Source of trans-
mission; there are always other grounds, other Paths. They will say, they
do not follow me, and I will reply, they cannot, for they have lost the
way and the path, they have lost the protocols and programs, they have
lost the roots and the loam. They will say, you speak in metaphor, and I
will not reply, I will be beneath them and I will always be beneath them.

The end-users stalk and run the earth; the end-users see the ends of
things, teleologies, purposes; the end-users see white buildings,
perfection, lawns and roadways; the end-users see paths and games and
deals to be made. For I say unto them, it is not the hackers, but the
end-users who ravage this old world of ours - it is the end-users who
package it and declare the insignia of crimes and criminologies. Yea, I
will say unto them, and it is the hackers who comprehend ontologies, move
among the realms and Realms; it is the hackers who save the realms for
yet another day; it is the hackers who understand the false etiquette of
proper naming, proper namings; it is hacking which shall save the day.

The end-users are tall and stalwart, and they walk the earth where mill-
ions find the beginnings and ends of things.

Others know as well the absence of beginnings, continuous withdrawal,
incursions of the real. Still others know the absence of ends, broken
continuity, the masquerade of bricolage, shape-riding of a different
order, the unknown and unknowing truths of endlessness. Yea, they neither
walk nor ride, neither fly through the air or swim within the sea; they
are the force and form of presencing, they move interstitially, they are
one with dark and darker matter. For the end;-user shall never know them;
blinded, the end-user controls the vast holdings of the real.

On this machine, I am end-user; on this machine, blinded, I write this
text; on this machine, I hint at secret knowledge; on this machine, thou
art beside me. Knowing what I do not know, I forsake absence for the
thickness of text; I betray my own kind, cast into the shadows; I am lost
in the shadows; I have gained nothing.

For those who know the rest, and all rest of the endings and absence of
endings, know also, I have gained nothing by this ...

the sun blasts stars out of the sky
out of the sky
its light violates all creation
the stars look over death
look over death 
they hide behind the sun
they rock back and forth 
and there are roads and fields
and there are meadows and cities
and invisible stars, swaying,
mourning the death of each and every
creature

and that is the first sign, the knowledge,
and there is the second sign, rocking
back and forth, all constellations swaying,
pictures of worlds swaying,
symbols and language, swaying,
and you can't read what was written
can't say who spoke what, where, and when,
and you can't speak for that matter,
that cold matter, against our ghosts,
that cold dissolution, the limits of what
bodies do, in turmoil, despair,
against the rocking of the sky

hidden by the sun,
the rocking of the sky

we are driven by procreation
we are driven by the image of death
sometimes the drives form turbulence
the turbulence is in the guise of culture
culture takes off on its own
we follow as if we are in control
we believe we are the creators
the world self-organizes around us
we give a name to desire which is all names
we give a name to procreation which is desire
every day we bypass death in every way
every letter and every word is an inscription
every gesture resonates as if it mattered
oh poor men and women driven to destroy
oh poor men and women driven to self-destruction
we are born into the depths of neutral territory
we are born across vast reservoirs of dark matter
we are born between ages of ice and nuclear plasma
we are born of and around the catastrophe
we exist on a plateau of imminence
we mistake the plateau for immanence
we mistake immanence for the surety of death
we mistaken imminence for the hysteria of desire

The Three Lamps


A circuit may be opened by a switch, breaking the loop from power source
to equipment. In this case, we consider the circuit deliberately opened. A
circuit may also be in the process of construction, in which case we say,
this circuit has never been closed. A circuit may be accidently opened by
virtue of a frayed wire, or a blown fuse, or a loose connection, or a
loose contact. A circuit may also be open by virtue of a burned-out fila-
ment or resistor. What defines a circuit? A circuit is a closed loop with
a power source. What defines an open circuit? An open circuit is a power
source with a broken loop. A broken loop is equivalent to a line segment
running through a power source. Consider a power source placed in a room.
Then an open circuit is defined by the potential of that power source in
relation to all the closures which may be enacted within the room (wires,
knives, antennas, curtain rods, and so forth). Consider the open circuit
defined beyond the room. Then the open circuit is defined by the potential
of any metallic or other objects in the vicinity or elsewhere which may or
may not have the ability to close the circuit. Consider a battery on a
planet. Then the planet is an open circuit in relation to the battery,
unless the battery is part of a closed circuit; even in that case, one may
consider a series of parallel circuits, with the closed circuit one of
many loops, in fact the only loop which is defined definitively in rela-
tionship to the battery. Consider this loop as a defining characteristic
of the battery, in such a manner that one might say "door-bell," "televi-
sion," "washing-machine." Then one might say that such a defining charact-
eristic has a proper name as a component, that name being one among many,
just as a blackbird can be defined as "not-door-bell," "not-radio." Con-
sider that there is a measurable potential between the battery and its
open circuitry with the metallic and other things on the planet, but there
is no measurable potential between one and another proper name, except to
indicate that any proper name will serve as well as any other, providing
it is slotted into similar characteristics, which one may call natural
kinds in possible worlds. Consider a planet of potentials and power sour-
ces, a planet of fields and nodes, and consider these fields and nodes
varying continuously and discontinuously over time. Then one might say
that the circuitry of the planet is mobile, transforming, and perhaps cap-
able of carrying information in the very adjustments that are made within
it.

"To locate the open with the ohmmeter, you would first open the knife
switch to remove the voltage source, since an ohmmeter must never be used
on a circuit with the power connected. Then touch the ohmmeter test leads
across each unit in the circuit - the three lamps in this case. You would
see that for two of the lamps, the ohmmeter indicates a resistance of ab-
out 4 ohms; but for the loosened lamp, the ohmmeter indicates _infinity._
Since an open does not allow any current to flow, _its resistance must be
infinite._" (Van Van Valkenburgh, Nooger & Neville, Inc., Basic
Electricity, Revised Edition.)

kludges in the real


finally the work was completed, the cmos system changed to disk format 1,
the system rebooted, tracking the keys once again. i downloaded the zip
files to dos, uploaded them to unix, unzipped them with long file names,
downloaded them to dos, configured wince from the cab files, opened the
application on wince. i added the returns to the tracking file, uploaded
it to unix, justified the results, took out the upper ascii symbols, re-
justified the results. i downloaded the application, installed it into
its own directory in dos, opened it in windows 98, ran it as a tsr or
daemon. i opened up linux, went to the /dos/ directory, went to slackware
linux from phat linux, went to /dos/root, and copied the files across to
/root/ and then rebooted into dos and removed slackware linux with del-
tree, then booted into phat linux and ran the legacy slackware applica-
tions. nothing is interoperable, everything transforms through filters,
everything requires translators. on the periphery one can distinguish one
operating system from another; on the margins, the real appears slightly
broken, as if it were the residue of imports, constituted by kludges, just
about fixed and running.

on the surface, rocking, the withholding
from the threshold, grain
beneath, rocking, slow diurnals,
frisson above, rubbed raw of air and water

of salt, metallic elements,
gas held in abeyance, of slew,
turbulence, of transparency, swollen,
of suspension, tepidity

faces which appear at times of thunder,
times of terror, submerged eyes, mouths
hearing restless bodies rocking, diurnals,
smoothed skins, shunting through waters

suspensions, shuntings, metaphysics of being,
foreclosing softly, inner and outer bloods

when a soul dies, it becomes dark matter .;.
we are in this world as ghosts, believing otherwise .;.
it is all the reverse; death grounds us .;.
we become heavier when we die .;.
we join the world of true matter .;.
we hurtle through our former selves .;.
we hear nothing but whispers .;.
death is always before death, unrecognized .;.
life is later, obdurate, inert, thick .;.
not spirits, but the thickness of dark matter .;.
particles huge, jostling, enormous heavy bodies .;.

we shall be frisson-dark-matter, weighed down with gravitation
and particles, we shall be bound to life, not to this death we
are in, this death-appear-as-light-life, floating ghosts we are
now, bring this message, death is prior to life, birth later .;.

Martha Graham for Foofwa d'Imobilite


My name is Martha Graham.
I'm the best dancer ever!
If you don't like me, you don't like dance!
Watch this! My feel stay on the floor!
Now I look anguished and no expression!
Everything I do is a real breakthrough!
Watch it girlie, I told you move from the waist!
I said waist, not waste! Forget your anus!
We're never going to eat again!
Angular! Angular!
My name is Martha Graham and I'm better than you!
I didn't start dancing until I was forty-nine!
Horst plays terrific music for me!
The Group dances beautifully for me!
I dance better than they do!
They need me! They need me!
Calm down! Calm down!
Okay, we're going down on the floor, let's go!
We're going to do everything all over again!
We'll call this dance "Open Border"!
This is the best method ever!
In the middle of the stage, a Transition!
Everything to the left, these American states!
Everything to the right, sweet Oriental suppleness!
Watch me! Watch me!
I'm going to stand up, I'm fierce, my blood is hot!
You can see me from my head to my toes, I'm moving!
I'm moving across the border, here I go!
Here I go, I'm intense, amazing!
Now I move from the waist, but wait, watch my legs!
Whatever happened to my breasts!
It doesn't matter what my weight is!
My fingers carry motion across the room and universe!
I said "brain," not "brain," listen to me!
My dress is made for supple movement!
Who are my audience!
I jolt, stagger! Jump! hurdle! Watch my neck!
Here go my arms! I have no expression!
Curtains! Curtains! Here we go!
Here I go!

nothing beyond death & there is no good way to die & all deaths are equi-
valent & all deaths end the same & death kills ghosts & death has no
excuses & death has no morals & death has no ethics & death is existence &
one cannot prepare for death & all life occurs in life & death is always
invisible & life is a withdrawal & death has no movement & death kills
worlds & death has no place in the universe & death is universal & death
devours death & death is neither subject nor object & death is always
tired & death leaves a trail & death leaves a trace & death is traceless &

death is always absent & there is no death & there is no passage & death
is not brutal & death is inconceivable & death has no attributes &

"the word"


tomorrow i will try and say a word to our mother in the hospice.
i will say mother and i will say i love you and i will worry that
waking will bring on pain once again, and that not waking will
shunt the paste of world and death somehere fearful and unknown

today i did try to say a word and there was no answer and i did
try her name and mother and i did say i love you and i did not
wonder for whom i was talking with and she will live perhaps just
a day or two more and i did hear her breathing

when she does sleep i do feel she will wake up and leave all of
us behind and be in perfection. she does look like she will do
just that and it will be another story. she does sleep and sleep
and is past all dreaming. she is just there and i do say mother 
and i will hear nothing and she does breathe and is not a thing


___


i carry the subnotebook computer everywhere these days
inside it are organized worlds, i write into them
outside, my mother is dying within the next several hours
outside, we hear things, breathing crashing through dying lungs
 tidal waves, tsunami
inside, the nurse can't find the pulse, the breathing crashes
 and continues to crash, crash, crash

oh what to do but run my fingers through her hair, outside
kiss her forehead, outside

among insides and outsides, worlds teeter
 among the permanency of worlds
