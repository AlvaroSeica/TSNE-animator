Emotion / Online:
Almost every space signs sexuality and community.
Difference between emotion and affect:
               Space and language always intentional
                (think of the ideology and purport of mathematical style)
               Affective space transformed into sutured space:
                 Construct of virtual subject of consumptions
                 (Internet World 98)
Signifiers: Emotion/Body (Thing):
               emoticons
               carried objects in MOO / MUD
               gift objects in MOO / MUD
               e-postcards
Signifers: Emotion/Body (Process: Writing)
               ytalk divisions
               : or @emote or .e
               pre-packaged actions (smile, kick)
                 (Hokusai character on Kyoto)
               _scrolling_ interspersions
               dispersions of different identities
            
Some Processes:
               ascii unconscious control/release (net sex)
               projection / introjection
                 constitutive embodiment
               performative languaging / constituting
               defuge (decathecting / exhaustion / abjection)
               wryting the body
Some Flows:
               virtual subjectivities
               saying, writing, threading
               narcissism and echo
Quietude:
               abandoned sites, MOO buildings
               firewalls and private IRC channels, talkers
Dread:	       signing on - relation to flamewar, etc.
Support:       support groups, bottom-up medical, identifications
               Walkers in Darkness
Death:
               digital eternity
                 outmoding of formats, market structures
               analog temporality
                 outmoding, noise
               death of a home page
               death of an avatar (abandonment, body bag, recycling)
               death of an email address
               offline death, online death

Kyoto
an intense clearing, city-basin, distant humans, everywhere visible...
You see snow, Luminous Sign, and the City of Wind here.

You have no messages on your Answering Machine.
Hokusai kick higher into the air than safety would allow!
Hokusai kicks you? Hardly! But it's always in his thoughts!
Hokusai heartily moves upward and downward on the same spot and fast!
Hokusai kisses everyone, remembering safe sex, and the kindness of
 strangers!
I see no "Hukusai" here.
Hokusai kisses you sweetly but intensely, and the MOO holds its
 cyber-breath...
Hokusai laughs infectiously and everyone desires to join in!
Hokusai laughs with you!
Hokusai sings charmingly about life beneath the ceramic tiles of the
 old country
Hokusai yells OH OH OH OH  ArghhH!
