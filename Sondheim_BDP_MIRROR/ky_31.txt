        oh julu i am so afraid of everything that may happen to us we
        do not want to lose ourselves in this wide world routers
        crashing all around us our words dead and torn from our
        mouths our tongues torn from our mouths oh julu i am so
        afraid we will not survive the storms that are upon us we are
        from the rivers of eden there are beautiful fish sea
        creatures that have wandered up the estuaries in search of
        loving pronouns these are days of plentitude we can see so
        far about oh what will become of us julu the tides will no
        longer run so freely the grey-white clouds scuttling across
        the sky above the phosphorescent worms and protozoa singing
        illuminating our worlds in the midst of darkling suns already
        there are sounds of sleeping murmurs we turn so very slightly
        side to side everything says we are not of your world but
        then of where have we been to whom do we belong o julu our
        lives are elegy and ululation we shall weep in babylon for
        loss of many languages weep in unknown tongues torn from
        our mouths and speechless

        oh exclamatory o the apostrophic call
