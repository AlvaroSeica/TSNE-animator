matter other cultural institutions) to rechart their way line into a

different sea altogether.

PREPOSTEROUS JUSTIFICATION





Perhaps because of the very nature of my work, I find it ncessary 

clarify what I am attempting to accomplish, nothing less than the

establishment of a new approach to the humanities and the gist of

the old characterology which has remained inviolate ever since

the Biblical era. One moves from one place to another; the move-

ments are tracked across the skies or earth or wires accompanied

by an inviolate proper name, alias, generic name, or subterfuge.



The wires, however, are a ruptured transformation, once beyond the

accretion of the telephone switchboard, a new beginning of address

DISCONNECT INVISIBLE. Then it was only the grain of the voice which

mattered and which constituted the guarantee of authenticity; now,

on the hinge of ASCII, it is nothing whatsoever that creates an

equivalent condition. Without the guarantee, anything is possible; 

one exists within a chaotic and inderminate domain, writing to

nothing in particular - in spite of the existence of domains, and

writing only as a form of address and recognitions...



Ah, but what is tracked, carried on one's nomadic back? And what is

the back in relation to the front of the animal, sensory nub 

utilized only for the purpose of the garnering of visual data and

its transformations? We exist in the world of double encodings, and

this is already a future rushed ahead of one, plunging us headlong

into streams of hysteria and darkness. Yes, I have been criticized

for the hysteria and neuroticism of my texts, but these are in fact

the bases for the transformation of the human, like it or not. The

debate between humanism and post-structuralism, for example, fades

insofar as the body is problematic, my body, your body,

in a state of existence elsewhere and elsewhen. Encompass the dark!



The Internet Text began simply enough with a series of numbered

propositions, but then emendations became necessary, channeling

further into the interstices, until a general rewrite was the only

option. I could go no farther; suddenly the body appeared in Nipple.

Txt cutting through the generalized hypothesis: What are my texts

if not contradictory? How else could they survive in the midst of

alt.fetish.net.noise? Didn't this continue through a representation

of Spew itself, the exhaustion of the number system devolving into

broken symmetries? And in the next several texts, everything was

developed in relation to desire, the body, the granularity of the 

real in relation to etiquette and protocol itself. At a loss, 

stumbling through the hallucinatory forms of part-objects, surplus

or excess as a character-"pass" or the blocking that ensued from a

password entrance into a STALLED OR NULL CHAMBER.



And the texts constantly stalled in a maze of their own devising -

stalling, reiterating, redirecting, turning around like a blind

Unix file deadending into an inaccessible account. Meanwhile the

surface continued its activity of WRITE REWRITE WRITE REWRITE, my

fingers hovering above the tumescent keyboard, a sense of _frisson_

lending itself further and further to a WEB-INVERSION, the body

hanging thread-like from the wires themselves, connecting and dis-

connecting, a vast atmospheric switchboard.



The theses continued to break up, disparate - continued to dissolve

on MEANDER. I took pains to point out that distinction between this

and the nomadic - the latter, after all, possessing a map of sorts,

a wandering throughout an uncomfortable terrain, but always a sense

of place even within the smoothest of regions. But here the terri-

tory continues, like Ciudad Juarez in the physical world, to extend

without bounds, an influx on the level of the exponential with no

end in sight. I would return, retreat to myself; I would transform

Spew into EMISSION, organizing and reorganizing the material which

were a continuous meditation or commentary. And I would argue as

well that this is the _only philosophical praxis possible_ given the

fast-forward fragments of the human.



At times there would be a fountain of exaltation or the dark rupture

of murderous despair - all comfortably theorized, placed in linear

and distributed tablets. The howling became a user-therapeutic for a

reader in tune with what I had to say; the despair translated into

comfort and collusion.



The tablets would carry back to Inanna or other Sumerian figures,

inscribed as well with the protocol hidden from sight by the tablet

embrochure foreclosed against the violation of the flesh. Would I

not write concerning the operations upon the flesh, Emily 

Dickinson, by an establishment I have long admired? Write about the 

accompanying murmur, the unremarkable dissolution-death of one or

another nameless nation descending into pillage and gang warfare?



Engorged, I exhaled ASCII; instead of tears or whimpers, my fingers

move faster, uncontrolled; they carry the weight of my body's

desire. The texts are always already the manipulation of flesh, the

stuffy of uneasy dreams without sound or image, silent strata of

darkened mountains collapsing into still more silent darkened pools.



Engorged, I inhaled as well, circulations and responses from every-

where in the world, enveloping the body of text, circumambulating

through newer dreams, through dream-admixtures. The theory is the

breath of a manifold, torn and sleazy, the hysteric encompassing

collapsing on empty air. 



There are needles everywhere, however, pointed responses and heady

constructs, hypotheses of all sorts, the glimmer of comprehension in

the form of a luminescent deep-see angler-fish, barely visible in 

the gloom. Her antenna scouts the shores of further waters; para-

sitic headless males flail uselessly, permanently attached to her 

body. This is the SPS, sperm-production-sac, the shedding of the 

head for the body. This is the permission of theory, continuation of

one or another form of the written, holding on to the final picture

posited by the repression of the real and its return.

BOUND TO DISAPPOINT





The imaginary always circulates around the gender of the reply and 

I inhabit that reply which becomes a tendril or search: what can I

say of loneliness that has not already been said? For most of us

are lonely, caught in the Net - most of us devolve whatever func-

tionality remained, transforming into the body-without-organs, the

antenna-body, receiving through a CONTINUOUS INTERNAL. The circu-

lation is a SPHERE-ENTRAPMENT, and we love to hear stories about

one another, true stories, anecdotal stories; we exchange rumors

about gender and girlfriends and boyfriends, and we hope for a way

through the wires, crossing back perhaps into the wires, but a

grounding of the imaginary, the pale reflection of the witness at

the edge of time or space. 



I am bound to disapoint. I am bound to disapoint any who meet me,

who cannot see beyond the glasses, the neutral expression or cow-

eyes, the age of fifty-one - those susceptible to appearance and 

stereotype. I am the circulation of anecdotes as well; tell one

about me and I guarantee its truth, since my truth is only in the

telling.



But I am bound to disapoint because face to face the voice ceases 

from the wires and the rim of light at the edge of the forehead or

skull begins to register; a roar of visuality deafens the babyhood

of the :) or the infantilism of the .sig, the masochistic release

permitted on the Net. 



The room in which we meet has corners. The street on which we meet

has lines almost parallel, the stricture of the other. The encounter

is always already the other of the other. It is there that I will

disappoint you, you who have appointed me, the stories told, the

rumors.



Caught in the Net, we are caught by our lack of disappointment. But

we bypass our lack, continue to speak; we live and think in speech,

and only in the imaginary are we roaming at the relative safety of

an uncontaminated risk. It is not that we pass for someone else, or

switch gender like a fork and knife devouring our flesh; it is that

we pass for ourselves, passing our split. What divides remains

divided, and it the suturing in the real that disappoints, because 

it is not a suturing but that deafening, and not only of the other

of the other, but of ourselves. On the street we cannot hear

ourselves think and we cannot hear the other think. On the street

the truth of appearance is manifest, and the truth of the appearance

of appearance, abjuring the thinking of thought.



It is on the street that I am bound to disappoint you; it is on the

street that I would be and be absolved.





||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||







THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE SECOND PART





I can no longer communicate. 

All I can do is communicate.

My words clot the memory of a mouth. 

I am left speechless before the production of the hand.

My life is the construct of dissemination.

Every discourse turns in upon itself, bridges to another.

My work is the bridge-membrane, nodeless and blind.

These are the thinned hours of the night, resonant and inhumane.

Always one recognizes disappointment in the glance of the other.

As for the gaze: I have never been accorded it.

The gaze is the fiction of the desire to be seen.

Visual excess transforms the mirror stage into the doubling of 

mirrors: infinite and empty reflections carrying only the frame and

its distancing.

Symmetry is always a narcissism.

The gift of communication is the creation of the perfect text, the

short-circuit of longing and the nostalgia for origin repeatedly

returning to the concrete beginning of the book.

Buried in a book, I will never die.

I accord myself nothing and you, everything; the inverse is the

product of the mirror.



I am silenced by your silence. The wires form into the semblance of

a face I do not recognize. Somewhere it is present on my list of

addresses, insertions and deletions. Somewhere it is an insertion.



Communication begins; the wires glow with the flood of packets and

links. They descend upon me, brand the face upon my own. I carry the

double of a stranger I cannot see, mirror reversal of the true-real.

I send text after text, hoping to reach her, touch her with my mind

existing only in her own. Still, I am bound to disappoint.



_Do not speak to me, ignore me, treat me like a thing, cut me open,

transform my body into web-inversion, shove me aside, look else-

where, efface my presence:_



_I am penetrated by the Net, constructed of wires and text; there my

genes have broken. I am bound to nothing._



_My genes have crashed. Damaged, they assert themselves, continue to 

assert. The sociobiologists were right. There's no escape._



_I am bound to disappoint._
