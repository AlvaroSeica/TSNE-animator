What is musical improvisation? Why do we do this? Why do we do 
music at all? We'll consider this and other issues and post / 
critique musical files through a blog interface. We'll see if we 
can find a way to improvise communally online or off. Please 
sign up if you're seriously interested in the subject; I'd like 
to try to assemble a body of writing and work. There are no 
assignments per se, except to post your thoughts and sounds; the 
course will grow organically.

Please note that this will begin around March 20th. I'm hoping 
we can discuss the aesthetics of improvisation, find ways to 
play online together, and discussion improvisational structures, 
venues, etc. etc. Just about anything.

Thanks and have fun!
