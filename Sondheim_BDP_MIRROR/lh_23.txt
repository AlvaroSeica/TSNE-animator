Parable


Izanagi and Nikuko walked through National Park Kirishima. It was a sunny
day; like mothers, the divine mountains embraced them warmly. Let us stop
for a refreshing drink, said Izanagi. Certainly, said Nikuko. They paid
500 yen each, which seemed reasonable. It is good to have a park at the
base of Yamato, where this world began and gods descended and ascended,
said Izanagi. Nikuko replied, It is even better that the base rotates and
wobbles with the rest of the planet, sweeping the heavens above and the
oceans below. Yes, replied Izanagi, we never know where our ascent will
take us, but Yamato is friendly and grateful, and a good place to sit.
Don't spill your drink, said Nikuko, this world has gravity.
