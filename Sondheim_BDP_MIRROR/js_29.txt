Escape of the Performative 


Susanne Langer, An Introduction to Symbolic Language, on Russell and
Whitehead's Principia Mathematica:

"The assertion-sign always stands at the beginning of a total, indepen-
dent proposition, and governs its main verb. If the dots following the
sign are immediately followed by ~, then the total proposition is a de-
nial. 

"But we can never make, symbolically, _assertions about assertions._ The
assertion-sign is the strongest symbol in the system. Nothing further can
be said about it _in the language of the system._ So the assumptions we
make about its meaning and behaviour have to be expressed as _informal
postulates,_ as also the assumptions which rest upon the _interpretation_
of the universe _K(p,q,r...)_. If this interpretation, or the import of
the sign [A], play any part in the calculus, then this is a non-formal
part, and the symbolism, which conveys only forms, cannot render it."

I use [A] for R/W's sign of assertion. To assert is then a primitive op-
eration, entailing the subject's operation upon the calculus; unlike God-
el's etc. production of expressions which cannot be effectively decided
within a formal system, [A] exists outside the system altogether. Consider
[A] the _performance_ of its expression, and the implications are clear.

Langer's second edition is from 1953, but the quoted material is also in
the first, 1937. Here's the beginning of a semiotics based on the _act_
instead of difference. Take it away.
