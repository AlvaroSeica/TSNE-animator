I haven't dane anything taday. I have let the haurs pass away.
I have nat dane anything yet taday. I have na time ta wark ar play.
I've dane nathing anytime taday. There's nathing mare I have ta say.
I've dane nathing at all in fact taday. I haven't written a decent lay.
I've nathing dane taday hurray. I suffacate in deep dismay.
I've nat dane anything taday. I'm much ta tired ta find a way.
I've nathing dane at all taday. I can't keep tedium at bay.
I have dane nathing in fact taday. I have na energy ta pray.
I've nat dane a thing at all taday. The day and I will pass away.
         toot toot taat taat
   I'm a dane in the rain with a brain.
   I've a crane ta maintain an a lane.
   I'm a stain an a tain and a bane.
   I've a cane that will feign, I'm insane.
         taat taat toot toot
