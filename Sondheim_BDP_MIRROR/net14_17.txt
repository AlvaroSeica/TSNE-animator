Doomed Love of Lost Words and Worlds



Every word that is placed upon the page is placed with love and grace.

The tiniest letter, the crossings of the t's, all there with the best

of intentions, the presence of a hand near a keyboard, or pen or pencil

in the midst of fingers. Do not forget that love pervades text, each

and every one, that letters are surrounded by soft desire. How many

lost beings traverse the worlds, searching for the text which, once

gone from their hands, becomes only a matter of mourning and invisibil-

ity! Tracking it down, recuperating it, is a matter of constant addi-

tion, the seeding and growth of new and loving letters, each with their 

own love, and so the text itself is lost, effusive, dissipated among the 

realms. Every book defers to every other, and we are put on earth to 

mourn our future passing. And our writings and the speaking of them 

remain no more than temporary memorials: everything, our love, our words,

our legacies, is lost, lost, lost, within the lifetime of a very young 

child.
