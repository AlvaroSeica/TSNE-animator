your true face

http://www.alansondheim.org/ossioswalda.jpg
our companion cat, temporarily blinded by seizure

your true face your real face before you were born
your vajra face your dorje face before you arrived
you arrived and never arrived before you were born
you departed and never departed after you were born
you are burning face with the light of an extinguished candle
you are true face with the darkness of a burning flame
your original face your true face darkness and light
your original face your true face before you were born
 
when i die your true face your original face written large
in the world under erasure of no-thing, no-one, 
but i say many, and i say space and time and i say,
pure space and time and the great horizon which is boundless
and unremarkable

and we are all ceased and all seized and all an ontology
and all striking a vajra into the heart of buddhism
a dorje into the eyes of buddhism and this is unremarkable

and boundless

Getting Ready -

 - violin

the music/sound of anticipation and hope, among a dying friend, 
stabilized companion cat, panic attacks and depressions, and 
yet, the hope of the salvation of sound, so this piece is one of 
tuning up, getting ready for a performance or a recording, but 
the anticipation, the hope, of course become the performance 
itself, just as hope gathers hope and anticipation of hope 
becomes, appears, at the very beginning of hope, hope itself, 
and then, more-so, becomes comfort, enlightenment, advance

we live always in such advance of death, decay, slaughter, 
illness, but we also live in-spite-of, the circulation of 
culture and culture's prohibitions and transgression, such makes 
us somehow more human, more among communality, more glad

in-spite-of and within a dying friend, a stabilized companion, 
an irretrievable loss, a depression which is another form of 
friend to the detriment of all

Mark Esper, rest in peace


Mark Esper, our friend and neighbor at 432 Dean in Brooklyn, 
died today. His work is amazing, complex robotics. I think my 
favorite, created years ago, was a small table with two self- 
powered 'wagons,' one of which continually drew on the surface - 
and the other, which continually erased the drawing. The robots 
were designed to remain on the table, moving about randomly, 
without falling off the edge. I think the table was around 18" x 
18", a white sculpture pedestal.

Here are some other works,

They smell such there be, is missing from my life. But when I 
close my eyes, or ride dollars a day is absurdly beneath me. I 
close my eyes and see I know if I close my eyes, the screen

Jennifer closes her eyes, smother you! I have closed my eyes and

along and I'll close my eyes and all the will close my eyes,

where i live

when i close my eyes and you are nearest to me, learn I can 
close myself off, huddle in this leaking room, severed from I,

is a curiously disjunctive and and i will open and close my 
mouthy mouth, and my sex runs your skin will get very cold. i 
will not close my mouthy mouth they will starve and such there 
be, is missing from my life. But when I close my eyes, or ride 
rain will fall until I see your face I close my eyes I could not 
close my eyes - my nails had been pulled - arms skinned - head 
down the street and close my eyes for a split second and there's 
the fist. and close my wounds. The result is a curiously

Azure's Wonderful New Song Miasmatic!

Four versions of Miasmatic, all in preparation for the next/
other; trmph preparation for the versions. triomph2 is an 
abbreviation; one is an ecstasy; two, three, and former are 
variations; in Aristotle's On Coming-To-Be and Passing-Away,
there are two circulations, that of the same returning to the 
same, and that of the same returning to an enumerated same;


MIASMATIC (Azure Carter)

What happens when the world
Falters

What happens when sex
And I occur

I am lost
In the miasma

Surfeit of shapes
Connect the dots

Curtailed by writing
Theory and practice

Withdrawal from the real
Virtual worlds

I sounded like an idiot
I cant control my words

I feel like an idiot
I cant control my words

I think I am an idiot
I cant control my words

Youre my heroin
Caffeine, serotonin

Cocaine, alcohol
Strychnine

Youre impossible
Lost and found

From outer space
Strange attractors

Broken hearts
Ghastly sadness

I dream of drowning
Hearts divided
I sounded like an idiot
I cant control my words

I feel like an idiot
I cant control my words

I think I am an idiot
I cant control my words

I think I am an idiot
I cant control my words
