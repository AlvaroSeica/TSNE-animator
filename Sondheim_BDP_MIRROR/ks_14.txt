One might always write dispersed mail, mail sent across various lists, as
in multi-mooing; replies, then, are in relation to partial objects - there
may be one or two of you subbed to all the lists - 

So I am curious how self becomes dispersed across these spaces? What sort
of unity is there for the reader? 

For the writer, what is called forth - what kind of resonance may she find
among varied demographics, populations?

What occurs in multi-mooing?

I can imagine varied dismemberings of the mind as different sites become
respositories of information - resonances in dialectic with the harmonics
of each. Here, I would see for example through more than three hundred
eyes, world-wide scattered, or reduced through duplicate addresses and
NOMAIL. Still, I am Curious, Yellow and Blue, desire splaying me open
among you, closing me down as I depart.

Departure from two others, arriving here; I'm broken up, nothing but a
hole for your inbox, messagings forever incomplete. It's here I can open
myself up to you, reveal everything - as if there were nothing present but
the _slice_ of me. Formally, I'm always elsewhere; my desires ride true to
form in _this space_ and at _this time._ You may have me, trickster, if
you find me; you may take me forever.

Already dispersed among the other lists, I query this one in terms of
conferencing - in which numbers of persona gather at a single site. But
what of the possibility, as in multi-mooing, of a single person dis-
persed among a number of sites, as in this missive, going everywhere and
nowhere at once? Would I exist only as a ghost, a visitor, or as an avatar
or communicant in his fullness? Would I exist at all? What is the phenom-
enology of multi-mooing?

A broken message, suborned among lists veering from one to another side or
site; this is partial, a part-object scattering my bones, absorbing my
moans. I'm here, in part, for departure, for partition, gone before the
afterbirth. Trails are left as I multi-list, dreams of multi-MOOing.

Has one done work on multi-MOOing, as this message makes its way broken
among a number of lists? What is the phenomenology of several open telnet
sessions at once, becoming different and differentiated identities or
avatars across various chat applications, textual or graphic? Here, I
leave tracings on a number of lists, rephrasing the same or similar ques-
tions, turning them into texts or debris - all based on the desire to
reconstruct the self when the self is intent on dismemberment.

Multi-MOOing carries itself across cyberspace; identities are dismembered
as an inscriptive skein constituting the hole. Nothing is left from these
messagings, not even the trace - numbers, construals scattered among lists
more often disjunct than not. 

On some, my deepest secrets; on others, insipid theory carrying the weight
of a peripheral glance. You may imagine me looking over your shoulder -
what remains of me, after so much time and space.
