my failures in second life


spending too much time in second life
designing too many things in second life 
in a single installation in second life
changing too many things too often
documenting with too many photographs and videos
with too many texts and audio files
hiding out too much of the time in my installation
writing over and over again about second life
forgetting second life is a tiny little world
forgetting there's more to life than second life
not applying for grants and exhibitions in the real world
not looking after myself in second life 
thinking too much inside the box
hoping uselessly for grants and commissions to support my habit
kludging and never learning scripting language
never entering second life in my dreams
pretending that second life has some ontological status
thinking i'll never die in second life
never finding real publication for the second life texts
never getting past moderated email lists with my second life texts
never really getting audience or readership
never really having extended dialog about the virtual
misrecognizing my second life work as having philosophical implications
thinking my second life work somehow extends the nature of the virtual
feeling too hopeless and too close to death even when in second life
and never releasing second life into first life and never calming down
hoping uselessly that my second life work will exist
at least for a short time after i no longer work in second life
and hoping uselessly as well that my work will continue
and exist somehow in spite of the ephemeral nature of data-bases
being unable to attract outside attention for my second life work
being unable to feel i've accomplished anything at all 
and feeling useless participating in issues of governance going nowhere
feeling useless in second life and then feeling useless in general
thinking i've wasted nine months of my life for an invisible project
never having the means to attend conferences and seminars
and almost always presenting second life from a distance
as if the virtuality of second life conjured up the virtual
and as if the virtual always begets the virtual
finding it impossible to really suture between second life performance
and live performance
and never having access to adequate technology to explore this area
never meeting the sysadmins who own and control second life
and never understanding the structure of the second life data-base
never working sufficiently well with the gaz stand-alone application
and never really exploring the open-sim application
feeling i haven't enough knowledge to contribute to open-sim
feeling lost there and finding no one really to collaborate with
who might extend my work or our work into open-sim and develop it in
depth in second life itself
feeling clumsy with my avatars' dance moves and not understanding
how to develop even the simplest avatar facial expressions and 
body attitudes
finding python, ruby, java and c++ basically opaque 
feeling like an idiot confronted with the simplest programs 
that i can only change in my dreams no matter how many ideas i have
above all realizing the foolishness and isolation of all of this
and being cut off from galleries and exhibitions, real-world 
installations portals between second life and the rest of the world
so that whatever i do remains in the tiniest corner of the world
no matter first or second or third or fourth life
while i wait to die or second life to die or both of us or my work
to be corrupted elsewhere as data-bases and files disappear
since another failure is my inability to get hard-copy for just
about anything i've tried to do in the past year or so
whether to get books published by academic presses
that might actually find their way onto book-store shelves
or to get reasonable off-line video disks and printed graphics
or for that matter to get a teaching job that might put food on the table
or health care for both azure and myself or building repair or something
to end the hysteria which seeps into my life when i think of these things
when i think of all my failures in second life
and the failures engendered in the real world by virtue of second life
or the failures engendered whether or not second life played any role
in them and i tend to exaggerate how much second life is responsible for
my failures which are my own
my tawdry installation is such a jumble it's called the accident
after i called it the accidental artist but the installation itself
seems an accident and in any case second life won't last forever
and i'll last a lot less and there never will be afterwards
failing by writing too much and hoping at least one person has read
the texts or what i call the imaginary audience
poetics and nettime keep my work off their lists 
in second life i might have used too much server time
who knows but my health is poor and i'm closer to anita berber
than poor b.b. closer to valeska gert than mary wigman
i failed to bring them into second life 
they all ran away from second life
they were smart and smarter than me
they did things in memory
i've been spending too much time in memory and my data is in memory
my data miscarried 
i'm lost in my data and my data miscarried

        waiting for late-night mail to arrive; on second thought
it is a nightmare in disguise -
through the dim dark night by the knight's despair by the armor there
Where down the river there is a gathering of knights and women, I think
the world's swollen slow breathing, day-night cycles, senescent rabid 
break-night softly shutter our planet, and this is a privilege only 
& good night, good night &
& we're barreling down the highway it's late at night
& night the rain the search dead cell phone & we're out of luck
& we're bullet hurtling night we've got all day
& i am frightened. 
every night i dream of crashes, plane or car,
how useless it is to be a knight! 
& late at night, late at night,
there are games after midnight after three a.m.

  katrina crossed the southern part of the state last night from east to 
west & last night azure was sleeping, i moved close to her.

- antennas receivers frogs receivers - - night - frogs were frogs, trees
into the night, spoken-for, this last gasp, tremor, prediction, against 
words that were never there, we're our shell, we're holding on

& keeping a look out for signals during the night.
& reporting back any keep a look during night & from me & distance - it 
may happen tonight; it may happen tomorrow; or a century from now - 
bodies - another one - & you might have already seen this  
path, "nature path" through them.

at night, distant glimmers of eternity
on the nightmare cat
on the nightmare cat with two heads
and look into your eyes, endless nights of sunset dawns, and dual and
you close your eyes for still
greater nightmares and visitations. as you move through your daylight 
hours, then Julu Twine, Julu -

Julu Twine: of the dreams of night, sir, I am your mistress, and of the
hypocrite who can't write obscene, I am a nightmare nation.

Hir dream: 

"					and and can clubinged

the paths go every which-away and if we could leave our selves behind in

these objects sing with the memory of me who will be gone before long
and they will carry the memory of me
and they will disappear all the way past because of the fragility
 of virtual worlds and the difficulty of recover of virtual worlds
they will be forgotten there are these images and these videos
videos which may be called action-movements because they are the memory

Eifachfilm Cacirca's installation (and some changes in mine) in SL


There's an installation by Eifachfilm Vacirca in Second Life - if you go 
to my installation at http://slurl.com/secondlife/Odyssey/48/12/22 then go 
to the area to the right with the strange texture - there's a three or 
four story floating environment I like a great deal - do check it out - as 
well as the texture itself - http://slurl.com/secondlife/Odyssey/72/45/58 
might work directly. Sugar Seville did the ground, Gazira Babeli did the 
meteors. Ian Murray's OCAD campus is in the background. All of this is 
really worth seeing; I've spent quite a while with Einfachfilm's piece.

Some images of hir installation along with Sugar's textures and in 
relation to mine at http://www.alansondheim.org/ eingazugar pngs.

(Some images and video of the dynamic aspects of my installation as of 
yesterday at alansondheim.org - brb pngs and especially brb.mp4. All of
these are the latest, so at the top of the directory if you click the 
date twice.)

Eifachfilm's installation exists on four levels, but there are ghost falls 
reflecting the natural world, that reach the ground and below. It's spikey 
and moody and it's good to stay awhile. I caught up with him somewhere in 
my own piece and talked to him about it; it was about 3 a.m. my time. S/he 
was in Zurich I believe and gave permission to include the following.

[23:57]  Alan Dojoji: hi - really like your installation - it's amazing
[23:58]  Eifachfilm Vacirca: tnx :)
[23:58]  Alan Dojoji: i hope it can stay up for a while and if you write 
something & sent it to me I'd like to advertise it on the lists I'm on
[23:59]  Alan Dojoji: the detailing is beautiful and it's one of the few 
things I've seen that works with nature in an intelligent way here
[23:59]  Alan Dojoji: it works well above Sugar's texture too
[23:59]  Eifachfilm Vacirca: it is very difficult for me to write about it
[0:00]  Eifachfilm Vacirca: its about cutting prims
[0:01]  Eifachfilm Vacirca: its about unique prims
[0:01]  Alan Dojoji: it's also about emissions and things that are only 
partly there, almost peripheral I think
[0:01]  Eifachfilm Vacirca: about nature never generates copies
[0:01]  Alan Dojoji: but because we're familiar with - yes - and we're 
familiar with romanticism so we tend to fill in the gaps
[0:02]  Alan Dojoji: azure and i go fungus hunting sometimes - 
photographing slime molds and things - and this reminds me of that - you 
stumble across small things that resonate
[0:03]  Alan Dojoji: and it's as if they're growing there instead of 
possessing the kind of artificiality the trees have for example in this 
space
[0:05]  Eifachfilm Vacirca: its like a musician
[0:05]  Eifachfilm Vacirca: i rez it
[0:05]  Alan Dojoji: ok -
[0:05]  Eifachfilm Vacirca: like a note i play in a jam session
[0:05]  Eifachfilm Vacirca: usualy you dont write it down
[0:06]  Eifachfilm Vacirca: it just happening
[0:06]  Eifachfilm Vacirca: some enjoy it
[0:06]  Eifachfilm Vacirca: some not
[0:06]  Alan Dojoji: it's intrinsic, not extrinsic
[0:07]  Eifachfilm Vacirca: a text about it will also give me the feeling 
to cage it
[0:07]  Alan Dojoji: i mean what's present seems inherent, not 
externalized - these sphere here are the opposite, they're following the 
order of an avatar path
[0:07]  Alan Dojoji: at lesat with music improv - Derek Bailey for example 
- there are writings about the music that don't pin it down -
[0:08]  Alan Dojoji: they're much more open than that
[0:08]  Alan Dojoji: i'd hope that good work here gives one the space to 
think about things
[0:08]  Eifachfilm Vacirca: yes
[0:08]  Eifachfilm Vacirca: it happens
[0:09]  Eifachfilm Vacirca: people think a lot
[0:09]  Eifachfilm Vacirca: in here
[0:09]  Eifachfilm Vacirca: develop new social structures
[0:09]  Alan Dojoji: some do - some rely on easy surrealism or fantasy 
here - i think most do
[0:09]  Eifachfilm Vacirca: and change em day by day
[0:10]  Eifachfilm Vacirca: it sthe pain you have to take with you



borrowers

i'm making on borrowed time.
i'm living on borrowed time.
on borrowed space i'm making and making.
soon i will lose this space and i will take my tiny house with me.
where will my tiny house go, where will my tiny house go.
i am a snail in a shell. my shell is memory.
my shell goes where my memory follows.
it never was my land or online time.
it was someone else, you were that someone else.
in my second life i have over 2000 objects in my inventory.
a for of capital in an indefinite economy.
a political economy to be sure, with borrowing and small return.
oh where will i set my little objects.
where will i pile them.
on my head i shall pile them, on my stomach i shall pile them.
i shall pile them on my left hand and my right.
i shall pile them on my left leg and my right.
on my left forearm and wrist.
on my right forearm and wrist.
before my eyes and above my skull.
beneath my left foot and beneath my right.
i shall walk among my objects and my objects shall walk among me.
may i be an object among objects and may objects be among me.
a carapace of objects new jerusalems and shangri-las.
a shield of entities breathing the vacuum of simulation.
they are my borrowers, they disappear with the flow of blood.
with the flow of blood halting, halting they disappear.
with the brain dying, cell by cell by cell, they disappear.
who will preserve them now, who will keep them forever?
who will preserve them now, who will keep them forever?



kroneckerdelta blues

played on an, as yet, unidentified instrument - 5-strings, similar to
a sarod, with a metal finger-board, no frets, and a skin head over a 
wooden-bowl body. but there are no sympathetic strings, the appearance
is something like a seni-rabab (which has gut strings and a wooden
finger-board. the original bridge was extremely high, indicating it
might be bowed, but it's not rebab-shaped, and that would be difficult.
the other possibility is that it was fingered only near the nut; it
seems to go out of tune otherwise. so i whittled down a chinese bamboo
bridge, which i shimmed up; this works a bit better, but only a bit. 
i found it less difficult to play fretless than i thought it would be;
on the other hand, the strings are close together and that makes for a
somewhat ragged style. i use nails, sometimes with a sitar pick as 
well. because of the humidity, the skin is somewhat slack, and the 
sound is an odd combination of incredible resonance and 'thump.' i 
tuned the five strings c-g-f-c'c' - the last two double-coursed like a
saz. the first five pieces use the instrument; the last uses the cura
cumbus, which is fretted. the overall impression is manic and strange
and hopefully of interest. (the kronecker delta is a 0/1 operator in
quantum mechanics.)

end of the tether


from one moment to another, the world is utterly irredeemable.
recuperation is always already impossible.
entanglement, indra's nets, irreversible: _just think about it._

http://www.alansondheim.org/ ripple pngs
http://www.alansondheim.org/generator.mp4
http://www.alansondheim.org/ gener pngs

i'm entangled between real which is virtual and virtual which is real.
i'm exhausted by inscription; i make mistakes.
i make far too many mistakes; i should be exiled from the virtual.
i should be abandoned to your fate.
now what is there about this. 
what there is, i postulate
that there are regions of the cosmos _for all practical purposes_ that
are deeply disassociated from each other, regions that, _for all 
practical purposes,_ are light-cone inaccessible.
and are inaccessible for the unutterable, unutterable information.
defuge sets in, _seeps in._ defuge entangles, transformed into
substance.
in this regard i am a total failure - exhaustion leading to errors
precisely as inscription stains. 
i follow the trails of easy paths, ignoring the real hovering, within
the virtual, the virtual within the real.
you destroy myself. 
await the tawdry. the sleazy, decrepit, o misery.
how can live with oneself, mind withdraws, vision blurs, range and 
ring of the ears.
oh, so tangled, nothing resolves, you go to my death unresolved,
you forage among memory already fallen through, memory overcome.
for there is nothing but the unutterable moment, one moment to 
another, each entangled, each absolutely disparate, on the verge of 
collapse.

when i think of all my failures in second life
and the failures engendered in the real world by virtue of second life
or the failures engendered whether or not second life played any role
and my failures which are my own
and failing by writing too much and hoping at least one person has read
and failure to bring them into second life 
exhausting failure leading to errors

this is the culmination of the recent series (some images and video 
has been removed to make room for this) - please check it out live
if you can - http://slurl.com/secondlife/Odyssey/48/12/22 or above.
rectilinear elements of yamantaka fold in upon themselves. if you go
to the space, turn the audio on, and video on and off. move in among
the elements, twist in them. fly among them, turn in them. here are
theory, deconstruction, phenomenology, in action. so much to say but
you may discover it at the site. oh please have a look! (by the way,
probably, with suitable suturing, a knot in four dimensions.)

<Su_Graham> the battery was running low i had a nice sundress, a 
battery-operated computer, with built-in modem, some reasonable and 
emotional battery, until the battery dies or the power turns off. a screen 
and a good battery, an hypothesis. oh so faint, this battery's life..

Taut by the computer battery, itself winding its way to exhaustion, and 
the skin, melting among the realms; battery-charged Alan forays once again
into the coming storms.

Consider a battery on a planet. The the planet is an open circuit in 
relation to the battery, unless the battery is part of a closed circuit; 
even in that case, one may what? Make a loop of some sort, and there's a 
measurable potential between what? Between the battery and its vision.

<Su_Graham> the battery was running low i had a nice sundress which
worked after we replaced the battery and something will get us there!

Not always well. Anyway, think of his use of battery power because of the 
electrical real. 

your battery tongue your generator dynamo
your battery tongue your generator dynamo
your battery tongue your generator dynamo

an energetic life!

the language-battery says things like this
"things like this are said by the language-battery"
no idea whatsoever and excellent language-battery

The Oddyssey Show going down in a few hours - last chance to see it


[11:17]  Sugar Seville: (Saved Sun Apr 05 11:58:49 2009) The giant devil 
and the poor dead souls
I come to the place called Odyssey and very quickly I see some very scary 
things that make me tremble like a cow who got cold milk. I see a terrible 
thing which look like a giant devil that is made of all the colours in the 
world and sound like a woman who keep saying the boy something the boy 
something and I don't understand. All the poor dead souls float up and up 
and one time I go too close and I go up also with the dead souls and I 
think that I, me, Reinforcement Lemon, is dead. I get very sad and full of 
panic. I don't want to be dead and I don't want to be at this place. But I 
jump down somehow and get away and never ever go back there again.
