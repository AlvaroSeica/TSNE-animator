 Part 3: the Wringing: Part 2: Addendum: Quotes from Rudolf Laban:

V. WRINGING.

wringing--is flexible, sustained, strong.


Wringing can vary from a pulling to a twisting movement,and is felt more 
easily in the shoulders, arms and hands than in the hips and legs. The 
feeling of strength must not be lost, as the slow muscular resistance felt 
in pressing is also present in this effort, but wringing produces a 
different sensation as the joints move more flexibly.

At first, wringing should be felt in the hands, as in wringing out 
clothes, and then extended, using different parts of the body. The whole 
body can be set into a wringing motion--for example in yawning.

Wringing movements of the arms can be directed into various zones, the 
most important as far as exercises are concerned being down forwards 
outwards, but there are many possibilities--with each arm separately, or 
both together, wringing downwards, upwards, across, sideways, forwards and 
backwards, extending into space in all directions.

Wringing should also be experienced in other parts of the body, such as 
the shoulders, trunk, hips, legs, not only extending into space away from 
the body, but towards it. Other possible variations are wringing simultan- 
eously with both arms in different directions, or wringing with different 
parts of the body into various directions; for example, wringing the trunk 
in a backwards-bending movement and doing the same action with arms 
sideways high, _et cetera._

[...]

"Indulging with" Space and Time, and "fighting against" Weight, which is 
the essence of wringing, develops a valuable control and gives and 
entirely different movement-experience from that gained by doing simple 
twisting exercises. The counter-tensions involved produce a different kind 
of bound flexibility from that met with in any other form of physical 
activity.

(Rudolf Laban, Modern Educational Dance, 1948, pp. 63-65.)

Collapse and disappearance. Remnants. It's not even wounded. It's gone. 
It's returned to smug inventory. It's annihilation: to the limit. It's the 
pure body of Hennix' creative subject. It's dysfunction. It violates 
dedication. It's for Jason Rohrer. It's seen in order. It's got to be seen 
in order. It's 2 1 0. It's 3 2 1. It's a very natural number. It's very 
natural. It crawls and tries to rise. But disappears. It's slab city. It's 
2999 and counting. It's always already burned. It's burned out. It's 
spirit and it's not even wounded. It's for Maria Damon. It's for G. J. 
Whatever happened to you? Why aren't you here? I never got to thank you. 
It's for anyone who can't escape the machine. Mind, not stage, littered 
with dead avatars. Absence. Naught. 2 1 0 and gone.

the worst is the nub, you can't get your mind around it.
the nub neither points nor retreats; it's an uncomfortable presence.
it's as if the atmosphere existed in a vacuole. 
you might say it's just the absence of an atmosphere.
but the fast fourier shows something else, a tiling.
the tiling is reminiscent of penrose and seems to exist a-kilter.
the nub is thrown off by the transform.
the transform is a dwelling and there's no room for the nub.
but the nub is the mother to the transform.
and the transform is child to the nub, a larger greater child.
a larger greater child to a smaller lesser mother.
the mother's a dumber thing to the child.
or the child's a dumber thing to the mother.
cry father, mother. cry father, child. 
cry in your child, mother, in your dwelling by the side of the nub.
beyond or beneath the nub, on the nearer side or above the nub. 
THE NUB IS THE VACUOLE OF THE WORLD WHERE THE TILING LIVES.

On Number

Mathesis boils down to 0 and 1 , presence or absence, + | - , and so 
forth. The structure/function of the world swirls around beliefs connected 
to and contained within the polarity. Does anything exist beyond it? Does 
anything exist between the symbols? .0001 for example is mathematically 
between 0 and 1, but it doesn't 'fit' with the symbols, just as + and - 
natural numbers, have no blurred distinctions, for example that .0001 of a 
negative. Is there a container, then, as far as you're concerned? such 
that one might have [ 0 1 ] or some such? Is there lookup, so that 0 might 
be assigned X and 1 Y? Is there a form of genidentity such that 0 and 1 
retain their forms, or, through pure ideality, is such a thing even 
necessary? How are 0 and 1 contained / represented in the physical world? 
What are their tie-ins? Do they provide a primitive indexicality of being? 
Is such an indexicality arbitrary? How do we position ourselves with 
regard to the primacy of 0 and 1? For example, are these primordial, 
absolute? Are they relativized to particular domains? What role does the 
flesh-and-blood man or woman play in relation to them? Is gender involved? 
Abjection? Is it necessary to consider the grapheme involved in particular 
instances? The referents? Are referents necessary? Sheets of assertion in 
any consideration? If we consider for example the calculating subject, 
does that subject possess a generalized genidentity? Does the particular 
of that subject - beyond gender, individuated history for example, play 
any role? Any primordial role? Is it necessary to go farther in mathesis 
to arrive at an understanding of mathematical ideality in relation to 
concrete physicality? Would a singular 1 do, or is the step necessary? I 
believe the step, differentiation of any sort, is necessary. Then is the 
distinction between one and the other, 1 and 2 necessary? Might one 
consider instead 1 and 0 as two stages in a process? Then why the "two" in 
two stages? Is 0 then determinative only of absence? Might one begin with 
1 and 2, then, considering 0 as fictional, as-if? Something in fact and 
fancy derived as a backward calculation from 1 and 2? If differentiation 
is necessary, might one find the concrete, flesh-and-blood, ontology to 
lie in the step itself? Considering 0 and 1, or 1 and 2 as the boundaries 
of the step and nothing more. In any case, I have no problem with 
induction, with extensions, fractions, irrationals, transcendentals, 
infinitesimals, surreal numbers, infinities, transfinites, etc. etc. Once 
an existence appears, so does its absence, at least historically? Are 
these things discovered or invented? Does concrete physical historicity 
play a role here? Is there a conceivable conflation between abstract 
ontology and historiography, parallel perhaps to the conflation between 
the ontology of fundamental particle physics and the economics necessary 
to generate increasingly high energies, as Brillouin had it? Let us return 
to the Brown's drawing of a distinction, perhaps, or at least to any such 
demarcation of + and - ; one might then ask if action is prerequisite, and 
if so, does this involve temporality, and if so a priori? So that action 
might appear, and then genidentity or some form of keeping-track - of 
calculations, of individuations, tokens, symbols, mathesis, even the 1 and 
2. But if 1 and 2 exist independently of all of this, as ideal, then does 
a subject appear at all? Is the subject that-which-ties foregrounding and 
backgrounding, substance and structure, subject and object? Does this 
result in position masquerading as solipsism? Is it in fact solipsism? 
Would an utterly emptied universe, think of no-universe, still harbor, 
without place, mathesis? Is mathesis prior to no-universe? Is 0 and 1 and 
1 and 2? Might one consider 0 and 1 as primordial ontology _in any case,_ 
and 1 and 2 primordial epistemology _in any case_? Why do mathematicians - 
why does mathematical philosophy - generally tend towards an absolute? 
Towards Truth? Towards the Absolute Subject as characterless and 
fundamental? Towards a basic primary of relation as in Pythagoreanism? Why 
is this _tending_ when tending itself implies temporality? Does this 
involve flesh-and-blood subjects in the final position? I think not. I 
think in any universe, 0 1 2 are already already present and accounted 
for. That they are present and accounted for in no-universe. Are they gods 
then? They are what passes for gods, in that they are constitutive. They 
are not what passes for gods, in that they are nubs, mute. They are 
whatever description might be applied, to the extent that the application 
is characterized by the negative, neti neti. But that characterization is 
for us, and has nothing to do with them. And has nothing to do with the 
gods either.

Mis/take (self-interrogation)

Above all, my work is philosophical. It insists not on the letter of 
philosophy, but on its dissemination contamination, of and through media. 
It insists on the visual as always already ikonic, inscription as present 
and concrete. It insists on the final grounds of unutterable pain and 
death and the cipher that exists, not as replacement, but as fool's 
errand. 

The mistake is to read my work otherwise, as neurosis or autobiography; 
the latter is always lies, fabrications and the narratology of the 
predicate, and the former is no better or worse than anyone else's, 
certainly nothing that structures the text. If my text is a symptom, it is 
a symptom of the well, not the hospital, and of a deliberate abject that 
refuses concealment or conciliation.

When I write what I might consider codework, the issues exist, not in a 
traditional reading of the surface, but in the production of a forest of 
signs that ground the surface as residue, hardly symbolic, but abject 
debris of the future anterior of the written. I am always aware of this, 
this structure and its motility, in every 'literary' text I write; I am 
more concerned with this level than that of the surface, which seems a 
production in the sense that a play may be a production, but is a playing 
as well, with or without the theater. 

In other words, the forest of signs are trees, im/plants, physiology.

In other words, the signs are signposts.

When I write a text on mathematics, it is not an exercise, but through 0 
and 1, a penetration among analogic and digital discourses, an entangle- 
ment refusing an unraveling. To the Borromean knot I oppose the plate 
trick of braids rotating through 720 degrees of 3-space, deeper melding of 
structures than meets the eye, or rather structures that meet the eye only 
dynamically and not at all through a laid n-dimensional diagram with time 
as afterthought. Not a formal exercise, however defined but the concrete 
movement of organisms through space, taking up time, proceeding.

In this regard my motion capture work is not an exercise in topology or 
choreography, but a philosophical investigation into the topology of the 
body, opposed or adjunct to a topography which is thereby rendered 
political or environmental, not to mention medical, within and without a 
phenomenology of pain and pleasure.

My characters, Julu, Jennifer, Alan, Nikuko, are actants in Heideggerian 
drama among MOOs, talkers, and other virtual worlds. They stand for 
nothing and do not stand-in; they are ikonic, one might say abject, on the 
order of a thud or philosophical gesture. This is especially true of Alan 
Dojoji or Julu Twine, who have inherited what Nikuko originally proffered 
in MOOs or internet relay chat.

I cannot force a reader to apprehend the philosophical content of my work 
- what I see as the heart of what I do, but I can say that anything else, 
anything bypassing or ignoring that, is a form of misrecognition that 
mistakes my circumstances for a world or word or ward, or rather attempts 
to interpret the world or my vision of it, through my (personal) circum- 
stances which are known to varying degrees, as usual for all of us and 
among us. This is in direct opposition to how I think the world, what I 
grapple with: the ultimate alienness of a existence that can only be 
hinted it - surfaces, for example, skewed within liquid architectures of 
virtual worlds, or languaging decoded to the point of abject exhaustion, 
where non-sense borders on truth's frenzy in the face of an unknown.

The world is an unknown; knowledge is always already on the bring of 
annihilation, catastrophic; it cannot decode its own hunger or power; it 
cannot exist without extraneous and useless style. All mistakes are to 
assume otherwise, but it is only through mistakes, miss-takes, that 
anything is acknowledged or apprehended. Decoding is endless; multi- 
verses fill incomprehensible gaps; it is within the diacritical that any 
progress at all is made. The chasm I acknowledge is the chasm within all 
of us; the flesh that falls apart here is the same as elsewhere. It is the 
philosophical that is the obvious beyond of religion; it gives the remnant 
a voice, and is itself the remnant of voice. The 0-1 brackets nothing. 
Murmur escapes the wall. Beyond neither 0 nor 1 is the murmur. 

But it is philosophy, in the guise of philosophy, and hopefully, in the 
midst of the noise of my endless klein bottles of texts, this is what 
comes through - not a philosophy of axiomatics or foundations, not a 
philosophy of absolutes or technophilias, but a philosophy constantly 
under erasure - an erasure in which, it turns out, the flesh is scraped 
raw, without an emergent. Synergy only goes so far, and only inso-far as 
one might deterritorialize the world, which means nothing, reduces to the 
ashes of the grave, the cries of the wounded, the anonymities of the 
leading-to-slaughters, all on the levels of histories under erasure as 
well.

if you are nice you can do anything.
if you are nice you can escape. you can move if you are nice.
you can move elsewhere. if you are nice you can burrow.


Propeller

http://www.alansondheim.org/propeller.mp4

The propeller cuts through the air like a knife through the body of Gaia.
Bird-particles are removed by virtue of the fold catastrophe.
The helix makes a vector for its own dragging body.
The body is filled with rough-and-tumble tools and organisms.
The propeller pays no heed until it winds into dirt and asphalt.
Dreams and spirits witness whispers of cranks and plumes.
The vector moves the air which barely registers.
Those tools and organisms register every moment of foreign occupation.
Part of the engine whirls with the propeller, and part refuses.
What refuses wants to return to the ground. Oh those kids of blades.
The ground is our aspiration as an aircraft flies belly-up.
It is a final destination in the midst of air's fitful ocean.
Foreheads align and alight before a twist and upwards we go.
Mr. Heidegger's hut recedes in the distance but Mr. Wittgenstein's 
blood-red spot is there for all to see.



the big fight

http://www.alansondheim.org/thebigfight.mp4

the big fight between the humanes and the aeroplanes
the aeroplanes are herded by their propellers
the humanes are amazing individuals choosing to act in consort
the humanes decide to deliberately follow one another
the humanes imitate one and another
the aeroplanes dumbly follow one another their propellers turning
humanes are floating among the aeroplanes and seem to be moving in step
the aeroplanes are truely moving in step and are not floating
the aeroplanes are working at floating and the humanes are not floating
the humanes are not working either




Here's the Thing, two texts

Here's the Thing

Consider two different watches - one with a digital/numerical readout, and 
the other with a traditional circular dial (digital or analog). Consider 
the path swept by any of the hands - second/minute/hour - the track. The 
track lies between ikonic and indexical; on one hand, it stands-in for the 
concrete space traversed in a given amount of time; on the other, its very 
physicality is a pointer towards duration. Consider the numerical readout; 
on one hand, it stands-in for the symbolic state of an instant, which is 
in reality a duration from one decimal point to another; on the other, it 
is indexical, a pointer towards an instantaneity embedded in a sequence. 
The philosophical position behind the numerical readout is that of the 
Dedekind cut; behind the track lies a form of intuitionism embedding both 
mechanism and observer, the track inhabiting or accompanying his or her 
internal time consciousness. Duration is an inhabiting; one might say, for 
example, looking at a circular dial, that it's almost five, that we still 
have some time before dinner, that he's a bit late. Looking at a numerical 
readout, one is likely to say, it's three to five, dinner's in a half 
hour, dinner's in forty-five minutes or so. Of course this is exaggerated, 
but the track tends towards the metaphoric consciousness of the body 
described by the Lakoff's and the numerical readout portends towards an 
inescapable but fictitious exactitude. I think of these as differing 
orders within the real, different insertions of body and technology, 
different prosthetics. The track is closer to the graft of skin or tissue; 
the readout is closer to an insertion or prosthesis. The former is closer 
to a fissure in the real, separating same from same; the latter is closer 
to a concrete division, a separation of x from ~x, this from that. In this 
odd sense, the numerical readout is classical, and the track is post-mod- 
ern - anything goes, the body runs/exists anywhere among intervals which 
are smeared out, abject, spewed. To read a track is always to interpret; 
one searches in vain for concrete divisions. To read a numerical input is 
the opposite - it is never to interpret, always to read out what is 
written, not to interpret the given, but to reproduce. it.

These two models, and the transformations that have occurred from one to 
the other - how subtle, what is lost and what is gained! One never thinks 
about, for example, those 'vintage' windup travel alarms with their 
ticking that measured the unraveling of potential energy, that ran on the 
energy of the body; now one uses digital and often silently-running alarms 
which are almost as disposable as the batteries that power them. One might 
say that the mechanical is comprehended as levers and wheels are compre- 
hended, that the mechanical clock, no matter how small or complex, runs on 
principles that are readily accessible. The digital/electronic on the 
other hand operates as a black box tied to corporate but common specifica- 
tions. It's not just a question of scale. Ironically the electronic is 
closer to the workings of the body, than the mechanical, but not closer to 
the phenomenology of things that surround us. It's those things which are 
receding in the distance, even the track or slow unfolding of time. And 
what comes in for replacement is the digital which may or may not run at 
any speed (whose speed in the long run may also be mapped analogically and 
with full cognizance of potential wells and the like), but which collapses 
interval into instant, and perhaps along the line, the instant into 
fashion, which takes all the analogic time available to fill out. Fashion 
is the crossroads here, indicated by the thing or punctum, but also by the 
roads traversed, the gaps opened up. And here's the thing: the walk along 
the line or from one side of the aisle to the other, the walk through the 
mall or across it, stopping at the Gap in order to proceed apace.
