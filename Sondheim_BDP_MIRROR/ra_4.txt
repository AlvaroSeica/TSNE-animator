Eternity


http://www.alansondheim.org/eternity.mp3

Eternity exists for the foreseeable future. 
It's the track of time, it's all you have left.
Eternity never continues but is always present for you.
It is always a gift from the futures, and among them, horizons.
Nothing beyond is ever retrievable or welcoming.
What you have left in your grasp is the symbol.
The symbol is always poor.
The symbol is always starving, always hungry, ghosts from futures.
What you move among is the symbol, what you see, hear, think.
The symbol is there for you, for the foreseeable future.
The symbol is this one or that one, the symbol of eternity.
Oh so among them and to write among them.
This is your body and moment, momentary.
This is among them and everything tends towards closure.
And closure is foreclosure, and for all eternity.
For all eternity after the foreseeable future.
The foreseeable future which is your own.

Dual Dance with Virtual Flesh- and Wood- Avatars

http://www.alansondheim.org/duance.mp4

dual avatar dance julu twine control puppet follower
going nowhere julu goes crash actually puppet follower
is stripped down alan dojoji 

finds itself falling from the platform 
the following followed and recovered with gohome command
so up they went and wooden avatar alan dojoji didn't trust
julu twine danced about and was hard to find and hold
but they didn't care they were together again and plat-formed

at the end julu looked over 
and didn't recognize the look in wooden avatar alan dojoji's eyes

*/thanks jo gaz fau liz/*

unparalleled mastery of the helix, julu twine turns the rails on alan 
dojoji about to assume the rein of wooden puppet bot in honour of feliz 
deleuze and guiles guattari as presented in all conceivable futures, so

PREDATORS

in these dying after-days of the twentieth-century
in these corrosive days of the beginning of the twenty-first
in these lost moments of the end of the nineteenth century
in these holocaust times of the end of the twenty-first
people have always and already between transformed
and they have lost their bloody useless skins to the sky
and the furious sky and there are numbers killed forever
forever and forever those furious primates corroded the world
left us alone the annihilation of the beginning of the twenty-second
rationalized our slaughter at the end of the eighteenth 
forget your stupid times, every hour's the same as every other
every day, BLAH BLAH, every second BLAH BLAH, every century
we bloody well tricked your bloody skins into falling to their death
we bloody well tricked you into dying too
BLAH BLAH BLAH

towards fainting

earlier today had a severe migraine and almost passed out, it was the 
usual light show in combination with excessive dizziness, tonight i'm 
close to fainting, everything's swimming about, i made three pieces, 
pipa/pipa/oud in this condition, trying to finish before i lie-down 
because i won't be able to get up anytime soon without passing out 
completely, anyway the first is poorly recorded so i had to deal with 
the hiss filter but the sound turned the usual bell-like which seems
to work, the other pieces are normal, honestly, but you can see in all
three the effects of whatever's going on that makes for interesting

32 minute improvisation in 6 concatenated sections
i'm pushing techniques here and the rhythm turns mayakovski
on the other hand thing of this as building cosmology
i miss a harmonic (once) but gain the full range 
3 1/2 octaves and the pegs didn't slip a bit
