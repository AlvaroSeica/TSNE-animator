" 
Dria says, "you just have to understand what it is that you're getting 
into..." 
Dria says, "but it is possible to get so much more from it...real love, 
can grow out here." 
Martin says, "Jerry's talking ..." 
Raxcip says, "yes, of course. " 
Dria says, "you sound unconvinced. :)" 
Raxcip says, "My friend was a world away." 
Dria nods 
Dria says, "aye...I know what it's like." 
Alan says, "One of the speakers is talking about how he enjoyed watching 
the the screen and Alan and the timekeeping.  This, I (Richard) think is 
an example of how net.sex affords a greater opportunity for voyeurism." 
Dria grins 
Martin grins 
Raxcip says, "I find it hard to exist both here on teh net and in RL, and 
wholy give oneself in either space.  I choose the Real." 
Dria says, "I toggle between.  I am not real." 
Alan says, "I choose both.  The unreal has been very good to me." 
zone laughs 
Martin says, "I really like Ari's presentation ..." 
Apocryphal says, "it seems..." 
Raxcip fails to delineate. 
Alan says, "Jon Marshall is asking about the ethical challenges posed by 
net.sex." 
Apocryphal says, "like there's no one-or-the-other each infects the 
other" 
Martin says, "The text was most lost on me ... but watching the images of 
the hands was definitely affaected by the MOOD of the text ..." 
Alan says, "Don't forget that the Cathoholic Church has decreed that 
net.sex is a sin." 
Dria says, "I walk out into the world 'rl' and I feel...unreal...it is 
surreal...it all feels surreal.  I have realized that "I" am not real (to 
anyone else, at least).  So why fight it." 
zone exclaims, "!!!" 
zone says, "That is astonishing." 
Dria says, "you're not serious.  You *can't* be serious." 
Alan is serious 
Dria boggles 
Speaker says, "Ari says even email is theatrical .." 
Apocryphal says, "the screen as contraceptive" 
Alan says, "Dria, I think in the long-run, this is a great development.  
With a simple decree, the Church has given credence to cyberlife.  That's 
a good thing." 
Raxcip says, "the catholic church would never approve of fun without 
consequence." 
Dria says, "well, yeah, but.  It's still stupid. :>" 
zone nods.  Yes.  Calling netsex a sin has in one fell swoop brought it 
to 
the attention of the world... 
Alan says, "Yeah, but I'll take a little near-sightedness with a lot of 
vision--even if the vision comes inadvertently." 
Dria decides to ponder it for a bit before forming a real opinon. 
Martin asks, "Any questions to ALan?" 
Martin says, "No" 
Martin says, "That's it ..." 
Martin says, "next sesion in 5 minutes .." 
Alan says, "That's it, and thank you. There's another panel in five 
minutes and I can possibly work this through as well - not sure what the 
situation will be..."

vows and curtains we didn't bother:and we made bows and curtsies to each
other:today azure and i got married :we were the skin of one another:

write substances we were the skin of one another through my vows and
curtains we didn't bother!

we're moving on and flying :azure in the other room and still sleeping
:it's later and i couldn't sleep for want of trying:time is leaping we're
seeping:

write substances time is leaping we're seeping through my we're moving on
and flying !

and stone is harder than our speaking thinking skins :and stone is harder
than whatever we might find ourselves to say:we're coming through all

your wraithe dissolves my and we're other and no bother!

memory is inconceivable, non-existent, the sun flares and destroys:it's
time and nothing else, this hour, minute, second, of a form of life:we're
moving, i'm awake and looking straight into the face of time::

in others' arms you read us:we are awaking in others' arms:we are others'
others:vows and curtains we didn't bother:and we made bows and curtsies to
each other:today azure and i got married :we were the skin of one another:

Turned as well from crazed and lunar night? Nay, were a literal moment in
some crazed transcendent metaphysics... Increasingly crazed; my loftspace
will be one and one, or one against another. The clock is crazed, and I
wait for hetaDburnoma74:crazburnotail. Random capitalization implies
pastiche, pasting, crazed breath and simulacrum of the crazed. One can
only imitate so far, before the Real takes us. We snuggle together and
talk breathlessly. We might appear crazed to other mlspl$cad tr$nsfprm$-
tlpns crazed lost-body-skins, clouds, crags, grapple-older. I felt this
was the one love in my somewhat crazed personal love, turned on as well.

susan graham


susan graham, there's something going on, well she said,
     look over there, you can see the police cars at a distance,
	  well she said, they've got their lights on, it must mean
	       something, there were flurries in the air, just a light
	       coating
      really, you c
      uldn't see much in the black night but the lights
      looked like
  	 towns, you'd hear the occasional siren and a
  	 woman's cry,
  	      it was heartbreaking, we didn't know what it
  	      could be, it
       was a mile or so away, the lights were
       swinging above the
    	street, flashing as
    	  well, as if they knew, an
    	    electrical charge in the air,
    	    sheet lightning or snow
    	    thunder,
       there was a feeling of
       danger, i noticed a dark
       shadow crossing
            the street, you
            didn't know what was
            going on, it looked
      	   all like stars,
      	   with the
      	   swaying
      	   traffic
      	   light above
        it all l
        ike a sun
        or moon
        sometimes
        a shadow
        would pass
             or
             the
             sirens
             would
             start up
             and
             die
             out,
             the
             whole
             town
             moaning
             and

             weeping,
             for
             whatever
             was
             going
             on
             down
             there

             we
             went
             back
             inside,
             had
             another
             drink,
             the

             slide
             guitar
             mourning,
             for 
             the dead,
             for you,
             you
             could
             still
             smell
             the
             heat
             of
             the
             day
             in
             the

LIFE

then in that MIX in that GLORIOUS MIX knowledge is found for a second / as
if GOD were FORMED through COLOR and CHARM and then out of culture SHE
BECKONED / only to be destroyed by loss and EXHAUSTION / tossed out of
CREATION as PROTONS DECAY / ah DEATH DISSIPATION you rull nought forever /
tossed out of CREATION as PROTONS decay:oh LIFE oh GLORIOUS LIFE / OH life
OH glorious life / just for that split intermix / when everything
perplexed comes together / it's that sliver of LIFE oh GLORIOUS LIFE that
looks towards the future anterior /:there's an incredible funnel opening
from zero to anything you say / and you go down this tunnel and you watch
near zero, protons decay / but you're not there, you're not there at all /
but just for an instant LIFE comes into play /:thank you one split second
for memory:thank you one split second for memory

o, susan graham, you are made for me
a glorious hammer comes down and hits you on the head
a brick falls from a top building (one of the best)
water bursts from the ground and drowns you

oh, susan gram, you are made for me
nothing like this happens
you are safe with me! why bother
with anything when the universe turns cold 

ohh, susan g, you are made for me
the ground opens up and swallows its very snake
you are saved because the snake comes out first
and then is swallowed by the very ground it has
come out of first

it is that very first, susan, i respect and admire you

i did not know susan graham
i had never heard of susan graham
 susan graham, you are unknown to me; I have created your name, I have
 made it all up out of whole cloth, you did not have to do this to me, i
 knew nothing of opera, of your career,

    , susan graham , susan graham

      i did mean you no harm, i would not have written to you or found
      you, i know nothing of opera, in fact i don't even like it, i've had
      no reason to know - what are you, soprano, coloratura, sopranino, i
      don't know what would fit you well or likely, it was something
      fabricated, i know the coincidences seem all too real, but only to
      you, there are too many of you


she lives on down that road, i can picture it now with the swinging
traffic light in the hot dry nighttime wind, i can see it, i know
it, it's right before me, i understand it all too well

  i didn't mean you no harm,
  , susan graham, i thought
  it was all a joke, i thought
  there wasn't any other susan graham, there was just the one i made up
  out of whole cloth honest, it was for a lot of writing i was doing, i
  was thinking,

    , susan graham you would be nice to see watching things out of that
    window across from that hot dusty dry road at night when you could see
    the cars at the end of the street and sometimes hear the guns go off
    , susan graham it was like that

    , susan graham

<Su_Graham> and i started to pull my panties down
<Su_Graham> i pulled my panties down slowly

            wanted
<Su_Graham> it was my cunt he wanted he kept zooming in
[0-0:GScNxAlFMPhR] 10:20PM @Su_Graham (+is) #nikuko (+nt) M:5 Lag 1 - E/X

* Su_Graham said this is what you wanted all along
* Su_Graham said you can do anything you want with the film
* Su_Graham said take care of me
* Su_Graham said you can do anything you want with me
<Su_Graham> i pulled my dress up above my waist and spread my legs
<Su_Graham> you could see he had a hard erection
<Su_Graham> you could see he wanted me
* Su_Graham said you want me don't you
* Su_Graham said you want more more than anything in the world
<Su_Graham> the camera was trembling more and more in his hands
<Su_Graham> he was about to fall
<Su_Graham> they were about to fall
<Su_Graham> off the balcony they were about to fall
<Su_Graham> nothing like that happened he zoomed in tighter
<Su_Graham> trembling on my cunt focusing on my face
<Su_Graham> focusing hard on my face running the camera over my cunt
[0-0:GScNxAlFMPhR] 10:25PM @Su_Graham (+is) #nikuko (+nt) M:5 Lag 1 - E/X 
<Su_Graham> i wish i could tell you what he said
* Su_Graham said stop go on stop go on stop go on
<Su_Graham> the battery was running low i had a nice sundress
<Su_Graham> spread above my waist and below my naked breasts
<Su_Graham> his pants were down
* Su_Graham said take your pants down
* Su_Graham said take your pants down
<Su_Graham> he came over to me trembling and scared poor little baby
* Su_Graham said i'll take care of you
* Su_Graham said i'll take care of you forever
<Su_Graham> he came over and put his lips against my breasts
<Su_Graham> he lay gently beside me
* Su_Graham said find me with your hand not your camera

go around and use whatever bricolage you can find
gathering dust and clutter in whatever debris
detritus or excreta whatever's available

suddenly an error and suddenly a piece
everything becomes fodder for the text
the text is a devouring maw
the text hungers for content, i lose sleep, i don't know just when i'm
   going to be able to stop, just when advance occurs

   when i think i have it right, there's an advance
   or a relief that the clutter has coagulated into the semblance 
      of content

      when i think nothing of it, "don't think anything of it,"
      "i didn't mean anything by it," there's stasis, prolongation

    sexual content mixes with the debris, it holds me there, fastens,
     fashions, fascinates
 it's what i found when i pulled inside you with my fingers, hand, wrist,
   arm
   what comes out mixes with error and excreta, debris and denouement

   coupling with lassitude, languor 
 so you can think about what has happened to you and the words
 so you can think about the world and what is happening
    it's built on debris and bricolage, on fragments and accumulations,
   on fair and unfair portions, on shares and certifications

    again and again i have it right
    again and again the world advances

give me a second


a line beginning "he weren't" or "it weren't"

effusive cloud, unknown relationship, negative connotations signed (up)
into something obvious

explanations and re-explanations of sexual obsessiveness

diatribe against the corporate infiltration of network interstices - phone
messages, icq, download screens, always asking for registration and "email
updating"

fury and assassinations of evil governments


:: these are dream-clouds, half-thoughts - i think these through falling
asleep, desperately trying to memorize phrases, trajectories; by the time
morning comes along, it's all over, i've forgotten everything, i end up
hating myself, the ideas are lost forever; i've tensed, i want to throw
out everything, give up; i become hateful; i'm not the person i'm capable
of being; the world seems as much nonsense as the phrases i've lost; whole
books, volumes, theories lost at night; in day-dreaming; napping; all i
end up giving back is the residue; what remains after everything else is
lost; ruins of full speech; ruins of fuller speech


texts which are always mournings for the remainder, remnant; identifica-
tion with abandonment, depression, the inchoate


retreating into sexuality; trancetext; theoretic; ghost and emanant


it was at the tip of my tongue; it's almost completely; just a second,
just a second; wait, i've almost got it; it'll come to me

it never returns; it's lost in neural columns; it's always already incom-
plete 

one is never present; full speech is never emanant


hold on; just a second; wait, no that's not it; it's really bothering me;
it's at the tip of my tongue; just a minute

my attacks on stupid presidents

registering disgust in sparkling ways
opposing by incantation
collapsing violent and ignorant statements
carrying his politics to their logical conclusion
abbreviating his language to irrational particulation
violating the very idea of his presidency
returning his policies of evil to his flesh and blood
transforming the body politic into the political body
surrounding him with taunts and debris
refusing him the satisfaction of etiquette and proper speech
influencing others through his presence as dissected stain
furiously disseminating abject critique
spamming his corporate distribution mechanism
destroying the anatomy of his spoken word
turning his ruined demographics against him
inverting his policies of ruthless extinctions
writing through and within obscenity
attacking engorged flesh and his political ancestry
humiliating his stupidity and its terminal effects
opposing his camaraderie with sparkling innuendo

Why Experimental Writing? (from the course I'm currently teaching for 
trAce)

The question is already awkward, since as I pointed out, there are
questions about "experimental" in the first place. But I've been thinking
about this.

With me, it has to do with personal, psychological reasons - a distrust of
all authority, including that of the form - a distrust of class attitudes
as well (I see form as class-related), a desire to move beneath or between
surfaces, to "expose" things - which gives my work at times an unnerving
edge.

But also to see what language is capable of, to see how far it can break
down and still carry meaning. And to realize that traditional or more
conventional writing carries all sorts of connotations with it - of other
literatures, of streams of literature - that can be alienating.

And then to explore new domains - for example moving or speaking language,
dynamic language, or language that seems to come from deep within the
machine, or exist uncomfortably within either the machine or the human
writing or reading or programming - wandering language that belongs
nowhere, homeless or abandoned language, nomadic or contrary or wayward
language.

To explore these, to extrapolate from them towards some sort of dim
future.

And then, more down to earth, to use all of this in the service of
investigating psychology itself, or the body, sexuality, language,
perception, the cognition of our philosophical positioning within the
world. And even to use all of this, language and body and dynamicism,
politically, as satire, as scraping away civil or military authority as
well.

Then also, to use various modes of distribution, from email list to 
chapbook, creating such work as inhabits the margins of these modes - not 
allowing anything too easily in. So that the audience might experience a 
momentary loss, as if one's balance had been suddenly redistributed 
somewhere else - a momentary loss that tends towards self-critique, a 
deeper knowledge than might otherwise be attained.

Experimental work also extends, as much as anywhere else, into the social;  
one ends up negotiating with email list moderators, publishers, designers,
etc., on an almost constant basis, since the work sits uneasily upon pages
or within browsers, etc. And there is additional knowledge often required
in the very making of it - to the extent that one might necessarily use
various internet, audio, or video applications, instead of pencil and
paper.

Then there is always questioning the notion of form itself, of structure, 
of the way the world is organized - one feels free to contradict each and 
every strand of things, making and remaking meaning out of debris, 
building on the edge of the cliff, extending into one's own discomfort 
zone as a way of gaining psychological or other knowledge.

All of these make up a nexus or skein of potential writings, well beyond 
the desire to shock, obfuscate, control. Experimental work can be terribly 
fragile, almost non-existent; it can also appear as a stone of a novel or 
epic, inert, absolutely certain of itself.

It's all appearances, it's all in the reading of it, all in the writing; 
and it's all in the confusion of such intersections as see the light of 
day.

MIAMI


looking down:your mouth opens and closes, a fish suffocating, exhausted
gills:you're standing, you're standing on a street corner:at your
breasts:at your breasts

your lips make no sense, you're mouthing nothing: MIAMI!:they sing: MIAMI!
they sing: MIAMI!:you lift your jacket in the warm night beneath the
streetlight::you look down, your breasts, no one looks

you look down, your breasts, no one looks 
you look down, your breasts, no one looks

you're naked, turning and twisted, are you having a bad dream:
MIAMI?:seeing into you, taping your every move:you're inside the
plate-glass window, i'm on the balcony:your legs twisted you approach the
window:your legs twisted you approach the window

your legs taut, twisted you approach the window
your legs taut, twisted you approach the window

you open your mouth to speak, i can't hear you:every inch of your naked
body, you turn your head and look at me: MIAMI!:you move closer, you
see me, you move up to the window:you open your mouth, MIAMI!:

open your mouth, MIAMI! 
your dirty open mouth, MIAMI!

you'll catch too much sunburn, MIAMI!:your dress is above your waist, your
panties showing, your breasts exposed:you're lying there, thanking me,
i've taken you in:you'll catch too much sunburn, MIAMI!:you'll catch too
much sunburn, MIAMI!

too much sunburn, MIAMI! 
too much sunburn, MIAMI! 

i'm taping you, ashamed, embarrassed, the camera closes in between your
legs:i notice the wedding ring, you admit everything, you're crying, your
legs parted:now you're naked, the dress bundled around your waist:your
beautiful parted legs:your beautiful parted legs

in the heavy sun, in the dark sun, in the burned sun, in the violent
sun:you're dreaming, you're spacing out, you're thinking of whole wide
worlds:i turn away quickly, the camera searching out your face::

come home with me, in the heavy sun, in the dark sun, 
in the burned out sun,
in the violent sun!

the burned out sun, MIAMI! 
the burned out sun, MIAMI!

the MIAMI music


to me the idea is to be buried
 inside the feedback loops blurred and resonated so they produce
 the plasma or otherwise ground/tamboura
  there are aerial sounds, the fingers against the strings producing
  racket: the background settles in, virtual particles collide invisibly
  as surface

  phenomena produce or reproduce the construct of entities; whatever speed
  there is partakes of the weight of the earth greater than ourselves,
  speed as well

  body falling from a great distance: the repetitive gives itself over: 
   it's one of the repetitive quasi-symmetrical measures of the universe

   there's no other reason to make music
   for me for me
   then to look at the phenomenology 
   for me for me

except for: the process of labor and the speed which short-circuits
 circuitry as if: going elsewhere: in music one comes up against limits
  there are no surmounting
  the limits withdraw as if they're not there

  they play havoc with us

  except for: the exhilaration of short-circuitry, fingers moving at
  inconceivable speed 
  i don't know where they are
  i don't know where they're going

    but they're constructing something as loops of thousands of notes
    making something that returns when i don't remember the origin
    when i don't think of it
    when i don't think of anything

   you can almost hear it

   it's there against the background droning and growing thicker
   so the playing has to be higher and scratchier

   taking it in with the memory
   taking in anything doesn't count

  looking around doesn't count
  playing fast doesn't either
