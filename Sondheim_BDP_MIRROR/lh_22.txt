Parable


Nikuko and Izanagi were at Kirishimayama, walking among the mountain
paths. Izanagi said to Nikuko, Who will write your parables? Nikuko
replied, It does not matter, there are none about how the Leopard got his
spots. Are there no female Leopards, asked Izanagi. Yes, replied Nikuko,
but the blemish clothed the male. Izanagi said, But who will write your
parables? Nikuko said, There are not enough things in the world for
parables. What would you have, Izanagi asked. More explanations, replied
Nikuko, as if causes had effects, and effects had causes. So parables lie,
said Izanagi, since they imply causes and effects tied together, as men
and women are tied in procreation. Exactly, replied Nikuko, the binding of
parables makes causes and effects, and out of these men and women thrive,
and make culture. What they do then, asked Izanagi? Forget both of us
after a while, replied Nikuko; and they continued on their way.
