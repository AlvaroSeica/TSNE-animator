On Cruise Missiles and Truth:


"Truth is a human thing, since I must affirm it in order for it to exist.
Before my _judgment,_ which is an adherence of my will and a free commit-
ment of my being, there exist only neutral and floating ideas which are
neither true nor false. Man is thus the being through whom truth appears
in the world. His task is to commit himself totally in order that the
natural order of existants may become an order of truths. He must ponder
the world, must will his thinking and must transform the order of being
into a system of ideas. Ever since the _Meditations,_ he has appeared as
the 'ontico-ontological' being of whom Heidegger speaks. Descartes there-
fore begins by providing us with entire intellectual responsibility. At
every moment, he experiences the freedom of this thought, and his soli-
tude as well, in the face of the sequences of essences. As Heidegger has
said, nobody can die for me. But Descartes had said earlier that nobody
can understand for me. In the end, we must say yes or no and decide alone,
for the entire universe, on what is true. This adherence is a metaphysical
and absolute act. It is not a matter of an approximation that can be
called into question again." (From Sartre, Cartesian Freedom, in Literary
and Philosophical Essays, trans. Michelson.)
