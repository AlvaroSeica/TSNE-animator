the avatar of light ascendent

dissolution of visual ontologies
what's left, but rays from one to another, one to one
software's accidents renewing wayward beauty

can you recognize beauty, nikuko
without form or substance, the dreaming of beauty

beauty dreams, what does beauty, dreaming
beauty dreaming of beauty, beauty  illuminated, silent, 
slightly bored
tears and sighs of beauty, murmur of beauty dreaming
ennui of beauty, the cliffs

presence of software, always its absence
absence of software, always its presence

hir beauty from within, illumination
beauty is never without

beauty is never without, what, but the presence of darkness
but yes, the presence of darkness, presence of light

the canyons. look outside, julu, beauty is without
look inside, travis, distraught slaughter melds, fallow, away

hir rising, hir searching ascendent beneath the waves,
hir illumination

o how the earth-hearth shatters, that such light bursts forth
o jennifer, shafts and clouds of light

death, the dust, partners, particles, unimaginable seeings
death, the dust, time tangled in hir wayward lightening

- Levels of thought returning knowledge -

( Working through the visual/audio/new media work I create, in relation 
to writing theory, description, explanation.)

- Levels of thought returning knowledge -

- Abstract mathematics, logic: theoretically exact structures undermined 
from within. Independent of representation.

- Mathematical physics: structures aligned through taxonomy and experi- 
mentation. Aligned representation.

- Interpretive gestures relating both to ordinary language, making sense 
of the world in terms of lived phenomena. Local linguistic tropes.

- Philosophical constructs within the interstices of the above three, 
positioning human consciousness and apperception within physical, psycho- 
logical, and psychoanalytical models. Language within the humanities.

- Visual representations of the first two as models or guides to the third 
and fourth. Separations of models and analogs, metaphors and metonymies on 
a practical level.

- Visual constructions extending concepts of consciousness and perception 
through illogical or surreal means.

- Revisioning worlds through mathematics, physics, and language, as 
natural or unnatural kinds in possible universes.

- Anthropic principles described in terms of mathesis, physics, and the 
neurophysiology of mind.

- Cultural productions, rites and rituals as superstructures unlinked to 
physics and mathematics.

- Cultural productions loosely based on metaphoric interpretations of 
physical and mathematical structures.

- Cultural productions researching the internal consciousness and phenom- 
enology of formal mathematical and physical structures.

- Working within the last, producing experiences that require negotiation 
of normative perception, involving 'Hamiltonians' for the appearances and 
appetition of otherwise spatialities, causalities, temporalities.

- Constructing a psychoanalytics of rapprochement of practical and theor- 
etical knowledge of the world.

- Constructing this psychoanalytics through experience of sensory modal- 
ities beyond those of standard writing/inscription.

- Problematizing inscription itself as fundamental mode of being in the 
body, the world, the symbolic.

- Finding means to take such experiences as given, for example, among 
deliberately virtual worlds, and re-presenting them to others, in such a 
manner that they return and enter into symbolic discourse.

- In other words creating discussion around experience that deepens our 
understanding of the inherently alien (in the sense of everyday life) 
nature of the world.

- So that one inhabits both more or less traditional lifeworlds, and 
worlds within which traditional mathematico-logical constructs no longer 
hold (dimensionalities, standard definitions of number, identity, duality, 
entanglement, and so forth).

- Bringing or dragging, therefore, the self back into the most serious 
game, that of the entanglement of existence and essence, entanglement of 
epistemology and ontology, that deconstructs and circumvents all such 
categories, without replacement.

- Therefore producing a weakened phenomenology of reception within a 
knowing of the world, its social and cultural, its ecological manifesta- 
tions, in such a manner that a priori ideological constructs and textual 
inerrancies are circumvented as well.

- Returning always to the intertwined processes of knowledge and exper- 
ience, experimentation that, in both immediacy and imminence may be cast 
aside, such casting aside contributing to the weakened phenomenology, as 
if phenomenology because phenomenology of the residue, weakened to degree 
zero in anti-commutative algebras, truncated emissions for example, or the 
shape-riding of spews, field fluxes, unlocalized transmissions to be sure, 
unlocalized receptions as well.

- Never returning to 'the things themselves,' which have never existed, 
except across surmountable surfaces, things are interruptions in flows, 
slow decays, the displacement and circumambulation of slaughter.

- Marginalizing inscription under erasure and deconstruction, returning 
philosophy to cosmology and localized ethico-cultural considerations.

- Opening the literary again to rhizomes within sensoria that have been 
forgotten.

- Opening and reopening the social of media, the phenomenology of the 
opening as well, charting the phenomenology, remaining always in a state 
of withdrawal of participant-observation, never leaving the scene of the 
crime.

- Marking and re-marking the erasure of all theoretical constructs, noting 
carefully the life and lives of theories in relation to slaughter, death, 
cultural reinterpretation, the culling of history, the negation-effects of 
mathesis and ongoing mathematical-scientific exploration.

- Separating the doing of science from scientific structure, within an 
ideality ultimately dictated by the cosmos, recognizing the absolute of 
science, that it is not one among many discourses, but it is 'that' 
discourse which continues a process of revelation, in spite of the 
ideological-political processes that surround its activities.

- And again, never returning to 'the things themselves,' which are already 
lost, dead through repetition, and dead.

- Levels of knowledge returning thought -

games

well, this idea came about with doubled avatars, one of whom is still 
broken, unable to load hir clothing and accessories, and the other of whom 
has already lost most of hir attributes; in any case, they interact with 
each other in a clotted environment, starting out as swagger, then 
gradually emerging their games into the environment, swirling through each 
other (which ordinarily is not permitted in second life) as a result of 
one or another's uncanny attachment to objects, the games based on back- 
dreams of maenads for example, or live performances, these however created 
while i ran back and forth among computers, orchestrating everything, as 
if these avatars had lives of their own, philo thinks through materiality 
as apart and i think of it as aperture

rainy day

http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/rainyday.mp3 

endless grey and snowy or rainy days, and
the sun rises on a rainy day,
and i imagine a long tube from the cloud cover and rainy sky and all the
simple questions take you through the rainy days, the hard times

my way, and violet light in rainy weather will be
almost worn away, dangerous, a rainy day, and the greys, blacks, and
rainy rainy nikuko, and
the sun rising on a rainy day, 
appearing once during april's rainy wound
and the sun rising on a rainy day

the bedroom wall seeps moisture whenever there's a rainy wind, 
and from her mouth sag carved pipe, the very best world,
and on a rainy day

on a rainy afternoon, as usual thinking about death and decay
the sun rising on this rainy rainy day

On the rewrytings, rewrythings, of the culling / interpreting texts *


You'd have to go through the texts to discover the innovations that occur 
at almost every turn. The culling operations are never 'pure'; they lend 
themselves to rearrangements, re-editings, textual manipulations of all 
sorts. The end results is a theory mashup, but a theory nonetheless. The 
mashup creates an entangled state in terms of definition, the position of 
the subject (reader, theorizer, experimenter), the original theoretical 
structure and substructure, and so on. From the entangled state, from the 
mashup, three fields emerge: that of the original theoretical structure, 
now somewhat transformed or reinterpreted; that of the positioning of 
subjectivity and its phenomenology in relation to the theory; and that of 
a 'doubled diegesis.' The doubled diegesis combines and entangles the 
traditional elements of narratology - what sorts of stories may be 
revealed in the text - with a phenomenological diegesis - what the subject 
(in any sense) is discovering and interpreting in relation to a self- 
reflexive hermeneutics. It's this last that behaves as a kind of textual 
_operator_ situated between the subject and the original theorizing.

If the theory is mathematical and complete, to the extend that it is, and 
remains formalizable, the transformations above (considered as a series or 
collocation of operations and writings/wrytings) are distortions at best. 
But if the theory entangles the subject (even mathematically, as in QM), 
then the phenomenology of subjectivity, from the position(ing) of the 
subject, is revealed; what emerges is a theoretical corpus that is part 
psychological-philosophical and part structural, and that re-presents the 
subject to hirself in relation to generalized operations of encodings and 
decodings, coagulations and dissipations, etc., all in relation to what is 
understood by the theory and the _subject-matter_ of the theory as well.

The entangled mashup, in other words, tends towards new paths through the 
_body of theory,_ emphasizing the body of the subject and its abjections, 
inscriptions, and materiality. All of this is a way of doing theory, or 
re-doing the re/presentation of theory, tending towards new and different 
phenomenologies of approach, relevance, interpretation, and appetition. 
How and what is grasped, what is the semiotics and abjections of such 
grasping, what is developed and developing - these are the sorts of things 
involved.

The entangled mashup is also a textual body, and a body of text; it is 
wryterly, in this entanglement and in the sense that a kind of unraveling 
must be done, in order for it to operate. There is no 'correct' operation 
- no well-defined path; otherwise, the mashup would emerge as an imminent 
and coherent, as well as somewhat linear, system or description involving 
protocol sentences. Instead, a more suitable metaphor might be that of a 
surgery involving cuts, folds, sutures, pathways and bypasses, coagulents 
and fields - a surgery that is performed, again entangled, among the 
subject's subjectivities, the texts, the originary texts, and the theory - 
if there were one in the first place - as well as its structures and 
substructures.

In short what emerges is a partial discourse of part-objects, resulting, 
one can only hope, in new modes of understanding, or comprehension - a 
discourse that is both a dwelling and in-dwelling, that says something at 
the same time that what is being said is already weakened, already 
entangled in the subject, hir body, the diegesis, the fragment or frag- 
ments, and just about everything else.


* Texts which are initially produced by a command or series of commands 
such as:

k%: grep -h [word|phrase] [set of texts] >> [initial collection]

This can be changed/interpreted in various ways. What it says is that 
lines containing a particular word or phrase in a set of texts, should be 
placed, in order, in another text, in the order in which they are found. 
This text, the initial collection, can then be sorted, re-edited, appended 
to, etc. - any number of additional operations in fact. The final opera- 
tion is that of rewriting 'by hand,' re-conforming the result to emergent 
meanings which relate to, extend, contradict, or otherwise in-form the 
original word or phrase. The word or phrase which is initially chosen, 
references particular theories or placements within the set of texts. For 
example, 'incest' might bring up a number of statements or partial-state- 
ments, phrases etc., with the word 'incest' in them. The statements spill 
out beyond lines - this is where editing comes in, to rewrite the state- 
ments to bend and entangle the theory in (its) language itself.

What seems obscure and complex here is often simple in practice. And the 
processes don't always work, in which case the entangled text, no matter 
how worked and reworked, etc., is discarded.


[On the other hand, even if they do work, are they anything more than a
self-administered exquisite corpse? And what good can come out of that?]
