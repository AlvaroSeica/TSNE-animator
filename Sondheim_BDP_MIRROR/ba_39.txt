I have been pruning bad texts, awkward or misspelled, fudged or confused,
from the files, wondering _how they got that way,_ observing the order of
errors, misconceptions, mistakes of grammar... 

And there have been runon words, and displacements write and read, just as

                               Paris,
                               in the
                             the spring

so often presents itself as pregiven, always already organized according
to near-perfect difference, need I spell myself any longer with your
spell? Not to mention the transpositions, hte for example, omissions, te
as another, or the absences of quotation, the as still another, or dupli-
cations, as in tthe, forever runon, as in therunon, or not to mention once
again those errors of format, carriage return errors, end of file mistakes

The most frightening thing here is _the blindness of the writer,_ and it
is this blindness, in fact, which keeps writing itself in check, within
the frame. The errors, caught or not, tangle the perfect breath, inter-
section of thinking, tacit knowledge. For writing is an aside, woven by
the autonomic - and it is not the most _frightening_ thing, but the most
symptomatic of the baseless diffusion of writing, emission for example.
The text is ploughed always already as an afterthought, and one is never
sure of the who or what of (the) it.
