Here is a translation of a poem by 8th-century Yakamochi, by Kenneth
Rexroth:

The cry of the stag
Is so loud in the empty
Mountains that an echo
Answers him as though
It were a doe.

_Yama biko no
Ai to yomu made
Tsuma goi ni
Ka naku yama be ni
Hitori nomi shite_


And through this you see darling Nikuko how I call you through the wires,
rural electrification notwithstanding! For it is true that the echo com-
mand - in format {k:0} echo 'command' - behaves just as in Perl, that is,
the backward quotations enact command, then echo it onto the screen with-
out line returns, but a pure escapement, pure emission, pure thrust of
activation

so that I emit towards you this echo, this command, reverberating in the
midst of the mountains, creating you; your sound, scent, touch, envelop me
and you sense my presence as I echo back to you, your wish is my 'command'

so that you emit towards me this echo, this command, reverberating in the
midst of the mountains, creating me; my sound, scent, touch, envelop you
and I sense your presence as you echo back to me, my wish is your 
'command' . . .
