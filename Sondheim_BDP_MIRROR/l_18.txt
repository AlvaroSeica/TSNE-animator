My New Life


My new life. I have arrived in this wonderful land. I love the natural
beauty of the scenery, which already takes on a kind of dream-line
iridescence. The cliffs on the river's far side are majestic, losing
themselves in a purple gloss during the early dawn. I have not the words
to express the wonder. The woman I love and I will live here forever, we
think. We are building a house, and will have it well-insulated, we think,
although the winters are not harsh. Right now, in the early spring, every-
thing is lush, full with promise. The world resounds with birth, we think.

We have lost our cynicism. There are no untoward flora or fauna across 
the way, waiting to pounce; no diseases ravaging the countryside, no news 
of distant warfare promising to encircle our home with distant thin red 
lips. We have no technologies to fear, and the water and sky are forever 
open to stars and depths, the Southern Cross smoldering in the heavens.
We have no news as well, other than our coming here and dwelling in this 
place. They say no news is good news.
