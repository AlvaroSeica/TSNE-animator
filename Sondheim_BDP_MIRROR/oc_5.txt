Filtering filtering


Reworked from a 1978 Toronto Notebook, "On the successive eliminations of 
the entity in transformations"

or rather all that is necessary from the diagrams

a -> a' -> a''
 f    f'

The function f moves a to a'; f' moves a' to a'' and of course there is a 
composition f'f(a) -> a'' or some such. a' disappears as an entity, and on 
might generalize, considering a series of functions f, f', f'', f''' ... 
such that (ff'f''f'''(z)) is a filter over z. In the lifeworld, f^n 
extends in either direction, i.e. n ranges over the integers at the least. 
In reality, n ranges over the continuum. Every entity z carries its filter 
and a filter is non-existent without an entity. The continuous transfor- 
mation of the entity is defined by the filter and vice-versa. Since z may 
split in the process, the filter may split. The series of f need not 
define any particular entity, but may be considered split from a previous 
entity, i.e. one out of an almost infinite number of processes, infinite 
in relation to the continuum. In this fashion, the worlding process is 
visible, the entity disappears, as entities do. Entities are named _in any 
case_ in relation to space-time; too great a dispersion, and 'entity' 
disappears qua entity; the background microwave radiation of the universe 
is an example. Too small a dispersion, virtual particles for example, ad 
'entity' is ontologically problematic. Within everyday life, water and 
other liquids, as well as gases, are not considered entities, while glass, 
also liquid, is. It's a question of a family of usages in relation to 
viscosity for example. There is also a notion of intrinsic identity based 
on communality and communication; humans are entities, although rapidly 
undergoing decomposition. Reichenbach's genidentity may be of value here; 
it references the actual material substrate of a coherent object, held 
together over a substantial period of time, and undergoing change qua 
object. Such an object brings human phenomenology with it; objects out- 
gas, wear, dissolve, split, from what might temporarily be considered an 
origin. All origins and all endpoints are subject to filtering, which 
dissolves them as such. One is left with continuous birthing, continuous 
languaging and worlding, something related to Bohm's implicate order on 
one hand and maya on the other. Of course the filtering itself is 
filtered, there is no end to it. To be human is to attempt to halt such, 
impede what is identified as dissolution, death, permanent impediment. 
Ownership arises out of this, as does the urge to collect, related to the 
urge to hunt, to permanently annihilate, absorb, be reborn in the blood of 
the other. To stay with the filter is to remain analogic, deeply human, 
chthonic; to impede is to construct the digital, build, aerate, delude. 
The digital is always already inauthentic, Vaihinger's as-if which resides 
for and in the moment. Culture veers among the various orders, as if the 
world and its history is ordered and orderly; it is the sympathetic, not 
empathetic, magic of this that allows us to survive.
