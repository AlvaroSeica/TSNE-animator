i wanted to write about killing a man but i was afraid for my life. my
life cautioned me, do not write about this thing; they will come and get
you. i wanted to think this thing, but my thoughts were overwhelming. i
did hope for this thing, but i would censure my thoughts, even in the
guise or case of the good cause, even in the alleviation of oppression and
misery. i would write about such a thing and hide behind my writing; too
often i have faced authority and too often censure has been my lot in
life. but this is something otherwise; this is a case of theft and aban-
donment, banishment and extinction; these are all cases and i would write
this as a last writing in the search for justice. i wanted to.
