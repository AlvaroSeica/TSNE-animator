dark virtue, dark sublime (for leni reifenstahl)


i

i dream of the woman's voice, hundreds of kilometers away in the night-
time wind and rain, coming closer, almost broken up, received on a boat 
on a stormy sea, fading in and out, the man from maine at the controls,
her presence most real, we discuss the flatness of the world wide web

ii

the infinite depths of radio in the dark night, and the flatness-now of
the computer screen, rubbed raw against our skin, as if this were all the
world that is, this narcissism, decoy of the infinite :you listened to a
woman, north north cape breton, on the short-wave, her voice coming
through the air, radio in the pulsing air, flooding our bodies, her voice
faint, you replied, i can hear you, i can hear you :in the dream, in the
pulsing air, in the dream, in the pulsing air, between cape breton and the
rest of the world, in the fog and thin dark rain, we were on the boat, you
were a man i knew in maine ::and more distance and radio and distance

come with me, the infinite depths of radio in the dark night, and the
flatness-now of the computer screen, rubbed raw against our skin, as if
this were all the world that is, this narcissism, decoy of the infinite ,
this world disappearance into mist, this irretrievable

iii

radio was the voice pining in the radiating distance through the storm;
internet is the cleansed interior positioning the body : radio was the
truth, internet the corporate; radio was the labor of the world, internet
effortless :radio makes distance that internet takes away; radio is
irretrievable distance, the reflection of the universe among the universe;
screen is cauterization, the imminent promise and premise of goods; radio
is you, is audio, through you and within you; internet promises you and
surplus you as a given, as an object, as a goods::

collapses the radio beauty, cleansed fragmentation and propriety protocol
of the net, my pocket panoramas

iv

as a child, short-wave brought me the world and withdrew the world; i
heard the lightning before the thunder, knew of the weathering sun; in
this dream, i'm returned through the maternal to the infinite, given the
language of the air; through this dream, the trans-national disappears -
the equipment was so old! and working and bringing down the voice from
everywhere; in the dream, the voice and wind and rain, the vacuum-tube of
the radio, interior hearths; in the dream the dissolutions of narcissisms;
in the dream, atmospherics

Little Poem


that's easy for you to say;
you've never been there before -
your open mouth and a leer -
that's easy for you to say.

that's easy for you to hear;
you've not been deafened by war -
you know you'll get by some way -
that's easy for you to hear.

that's easy for you to sense;
you've always lived for more -
i've lost a mind, nothing is here -
that's easy for you to sense.

your being takes me by surprise;
existence is denied me -
nights like these, I'm not here
and nothing surprises me.

i can taste and hear and see;
what is here isn't me; there's no
me to be surprised, and no 
existence sensing other real.

__



i can taste and hear some / i can run some and walk some / i can eat and
drink some / i can breath some / i can see some / i can't taste and hear
much / i can't run much and walk much / i can't eat much and drink much /
i can't breath much / i can't see much /

i don't know how to say to you / i know how to talk to myself / i can hug
myself some and hug myself / i can cuddle with me and cuddle me /

some things i can't do so well / i can't do some things / some things make
me huddle next to things / some things i can see some /

i can't say much / i can't talk well / if i have something to say i guess
i'll say it / sometimes i'll be silent and then i won't have to say
anything /

if i knew you better but it's too much / it's too much to see and hear
things / it's too much to say things / it's too hard / some things like
this make me curl up next to some things / i'm huddling now / some things
i can see some / i'm cuddling now /

Non-Standard Inscription of Ashur-nasir-pal II


Homing, herein I write my declarations, my names, all of you know my
names. Ashur-nasir-pal, I'm the ruler here, even Izanagi and Izanami are
obeisant in these parts, I'm the favorite of Daishin Nikuko, I carry the
their vajra into Ashur, I'm the king of the names of the world, you can't
have their names; I carry them, because I'm the son

of Daishin Nikuko, the son of Izanagi and Izanami, I'm the king of the
names of the world, yes I am, I'm the king of the names of the world and
the king of Assyria too (which has a lot of land),

did I tell you I'm the son of Adad-nerari, the king of the names of the
world and the king of Assyria too (which has a lot of land),

the strongest here, I've memorized all the names, just about every one of
them, I don't think there's any I've forgotten, Daishin Nikuko has taught
me well, but I also trust Ashur, who wouldn't, he's just about the best
there is, in the four directions, did I tell you I know the names of all
four of them, 

anyway, Ashur takes care of his people, he's really strong, but not as
strong as Izanagi and Izanami, but strong enough, more than the waters
that are rolling in on occasion, I could tell you about the flood,

anyway as I was saying, I rule even those who don't want to be ruled
because I know their names and maybe they don't, and this includes just
about everyone,

I'm the terrific warrior, did I say thanks to Ashur, and I walk all over
enemies everywhere just by saying their names, I certainly bring them down
a notch or two,

because I live by my trust in everyone's name, Izanagi for example, and
Izanami for another, I think I mentioned Ashur and I know somewhere along
the line I said Daishin Nikuko,

I named all the lands around and even the names of just about everyone
living in them, you can be sure of that, it made me in real tight control,
and they gave me things, and they had a lot of names as well, 

I took their names, yes I did, and it gave me a certain edge,

Ashur and Izanami picked me out of the usual group of people, gave me my
name and the name of the kingships, and gave me the weapon of  knowing
everyone in these parts, 

I yelled the names at the troops of Lullumu who were everywhere, this
happened while they were trying to fight, and as for the others from
Nairi, Chabchu, and Shubaru, I know all of them, their names and
everything, I roared their names like Adad did, he had a name which was
Adad and he used it, and then there was Izanami and Izanagi, did I mention
Shumarh and Adad, they also came along,

I yelled the names from one bank to the other of the Tigris, and all
across Lebanon, you should have heard it, and the Big Sea as well and all
of Laqu and Suhu and even to Sato and Hokkaido and Rapiqu, and they just
about all gave up,

oh, there's more, did I tell you I got the land from the Subnat River to
Urartu, knew all of them, and took stuff from the Kirruru pass to Gilzanu,
that was harder, I almost forgot things, but then I was onto the banks of
the Lower Zab to the Til Bari upstream from Zaban and then from Til sha
Abtanni to Til sha Zabdani, I've been doing pretty well, you'd better
believe it, studying night and day, day and night, Shamash guiding me, it
was incredible, all this work, but pretty soon I knew everyone in the
whole region, 

just as I told you, even from the Babite pass through all the way to
Hashmar,

I never did get to Tamtu Babibu, but I heard it was pretty incredible,

so I set up a lot of people all over the place, keeping track of the
names, it was far too much for one person, I didn't even know whether or
not or how many lands or worlds were involved, but I sure did know their
names, and when I'd have to, I could learn them all over again, everyone's
to be sure, 

well, as I said, I'm Ashur-nasir-pal, and I worship all the names and hold
them in my beleaguered hands, and I'm the fierce dragon naming all the
cities and the mountains, naming all the valleys and the rivers, naming
all the streams and rocks, and even the grains of sand, to their full
extent, giving all their names to the full extent,

I'm not afraid of anything, I'm the dragon-lion and the lion-dragon, I'm
called the Dragon-Lion and the Lion-Dragon, and with one naming I can lose
the mountain and the sea and the city and whole nations, families, and
rocks and grains of sand to their full extent, 

everyone's giving up around me in the six and nine directions under the
ten suns,

well, there was Kalbu which Shalmaneser the Assyrian king, built up,
anyway I had to rebuilt it, I remembered everyone's name just like that,
in an instant of an eye, 

I brought all these people whose names I knew to live there, from Laqu,
Sirqu (you remember Sirqu I'm sure, it's just across the Euphrates from
here), all of Zamua, Bit Aidini, Chattu and Lubarnu, they'd have a good
time getting to work,

oh, and I also removed the ancient tell, it was pretty dilapidated, I went
down to the beginnings of the waters and put 120 courses of brick down
there, they were all inscribed with the names, and the courses of bricks
with names ran all the way up to the surface,

and then I built a palace of curved jewels and gold and swords and cedar
(that was for the halls), and cypress and juniper, everything was named
just with the right degree of naming, there was also boxwood and teak,
terebinth and tamarisk, and I did this all to be happy and to sit back or
recline and continue with the naming which was occupying a lot of my time
by this point,

anyway, I also put in a lot of animals from the deserts and mountains, and
valleys and rivers, and they were all named, and some of them were in
private quarters, and some were skillfully fashioned out of marble and
alabaster just so, there's no end to them, 

I used limestone as well, then I put in the gates which were named for
the five directions and the eight directions, they had names skillfully
fashioned just above them, I gave them the names they bear, everything
beautifully bordered with bronze studs, 

did I mention the doors, they were made from cedar and curved jewels and
marble and limestone and cypress and cedar and juniper and cedar and
terebinth and cedar and tamarisk and mirrors and swords and cedar
thereabouts,

I put a lot of stuff into that palace, you'd have to see the silver and
gold and iron and steel and bronze and tin and copper, it is all over the
place, and I took it and put it all inside and I was busy everywhere with
the naming for many months and years, even right up to the present, and I
have to thank Ashur and Daishin Nikuko and Shamash and Ashur and Ashur for
all that.

Adad


This is for her, gold and juniper orchards, everyone was named Adad and
used the "Adad," and then there was Izanami and Izanagi, did I mention I
brought all these people whose names I knew to live there, from Adad? I'm
the terrific warrior, did I say thanks to her and her, and I walk all over
Adad and "Adad," they also came along, all of them. All the streams and
rocks, and even the grains of sand, to their fullest and nothing surprises
me. And I built a palace of curved jewels and gold and swords and cedar
because I knew their names and maybe they don't, and this includes breath,
swoon, and languor. Ir\emum takes her, seizing her, called the Dragon-Lion
and the Lion-Dragon, and with one naming I can take her. It's all over; I
can taste her and hear and see; i can't breathe much. It's too much to see
her and hear in an instant of an eye, the interior of her body. "Adad" was
her lover, I took her mouth, I didn't know where I was.
