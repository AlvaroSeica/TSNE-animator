LIFE, Definition, Artificial





Life can only be defined in terms of large-scale structure or 

granularity. This structure is characterized by internalized

differentiation of any sort. The differentiation usually but

not always operates as a plateau-topography within a non-

equilibrium thermodynamics. The plateau absorbs energy for

maintenance; without such it enters a quiescent or cyst stage

at best. Thus there is always PROTOCOL involved.



The internalized differentiation is repeatable - that is, it

is almost always capable of reproduction. And always the 

smallest units are capable of such; there must be some level

in order to process information. The overall structure need

not be reproducible. Thus there is always EMISSION and

COMMUNICATION involved.



The differentiation is based on a topography of CODED SUB-

STRUCTURES which have a fuzzy space-time neighborhood simil-

arity. These substructures fulfill varying functions within

the cell; they operate to maintain, as a whole, the overall

topography of the differentiated unit.



The structure in any case is tied to an entity-definition - 

that is, from an exteriority, appears to be a natural kind

given a proper name which may or may not be generic. Thus

there is always ADDRESS involved.



Any form of life must be recursive on some level - in terms of

reproduction, differentiation, the ability to process incoming

sensory data (assigning it to processing-frames for example).

Thus there is always RECOGNITION involved. 



The MATRIX of a life-form may be any substrate, from BIOMOLE-

CULES to any INFORMATION STORAGE DEVICE. Under this definition

a MEME is not alive since it does not repeat but undergoes 

from repeat to repeat discontinuous transformations. A virus

is alive, but the entities within the game of LIFE are not

(although they can mimic overt behavior) since there are no

differentially-coded substructures, only the coded substructure

of the LIFE-SPACE itself. In this sense, the LIFE-SPACE is 

alive, and one can construct transformations/topographies

among varying LIFE-SPACES.



Given this definition, there is nothing to differentiate

artificial life from natural life; everything depends upon

the nature of the substrate. One can define "artifical" in

terms of human-made, but even this is problematic, since

genetic engineering encompasses all of the following:



# Extinctions caused by the actions of human beings.

# (Re-)Assembling of viruses or amoebae from "raw" parts.

# Computer viruses and worms.

# Computer life-forms.

# Genetically-engineered vegetables and fruits.

# Animal and plant breeding.



(The list is not exhaustive.) It seems reasonable, then,

to operate with an inclusive rather than an exclusive

definition, and to eliminate issues of artificiality. One

can, however, make an ecologically functional category of

"natural" life-forms, which are those that pre-date human

history and (historical) intervention. This category, as

fuzzy as it may be, is necessary for an ecological 

politics, as well as an understanding of the planetary

environment as a whole.
