your writing


does writing matter?

( i sit on the chair naked, nikuko sits on me, she says, i want to show
myself )

does my writing matter?

( nikuko sits on the chair, partly naked, i squeeze her breasts, pull her
thin blouse up, she pulls my panties down, pulls my cock towards her, her,
her )

does obsession matter?

( i sit on the chair naked, my face half visible, moaning nikuko, nikuko,
nikuko, it's clear i can't see straight, looking inside the imaginary,  
inconcievable bodies and conceptions )

does writing matter only if it bears witness?

( nikuko lies on the couch, naked, her body twitching, exhausting from
pirouettes, her feet are bleeding, she cries doctor, doctor, doctor )

does writing matter?

( i lie on the couch, partly naked, turning from side to side, my body
covered with bedsores, she occupies me, she takes me over, her tongue's
my own, i have no control over it )

does my writing matter?

( i bite nikuko's naked breasts, leaving marks, she bites mine, my neck,
my naked abdomen, we're covered with bruises, we're covered with signs,
we're visible from the windows, people read our bodies, the symbols are
primitive, an early form of writing, they clothe us, we get culture )

does obsession matter?

( nikuko pirouettes in a short skirt, faster, it flies up, she's naked un-
derneath, her labia are visible, they measure the pirouettes, they divide
time, they divide the days and nights )

does writing matter only if it bears witness?

( i'm naked, i dance clumsily for nikuko, my cock turns uselessly, my lips
are bleeding, i'm calling nikuko, nikuko, nikuko, my chest burns, nikuko
is partly naked, she's watching, her breasts are pained, her mouth opened,
she's calling me, i can hear her, she's calling me )

does writing matter?
