Mouth


Your mouth is not your own, James, said Madame Lun, and you must remember
this at all times. You carry your mouth with you, but it is our mouth now,
designed for our pleasure pure, for our needs, our words, our thoughts. It
must be tended carefully, kept clean and lipsticked, with bright, sullen,
and bruised thick red paste, for our mark upon you. It must be opened wide
when we desire such, closed for our desires as well, filled by us, never
by you, never for your needs. Forget your needs; you have no more use of
them, nor do we. Forget your mouth; it is gone, you will never speak
again. 

Your mouth is not your own, Clara, said Sir Clovis, and you must remember 
this at all times. You are its guardian; it belongs to us, as if it were 
skin sutured to your own, gaping wide for our needs and pleasures. It is 
our skin now, burnished to swollen purple with thin lipsticks, gleaming 
like sullen bronze. It must only say what we desire it to say, cry and 
murmur with our cries, salivate with our memories of flesh distended be- 
yond your wildest dreams. Forget your mouth; it is gone, you will never 
speak again.
