tuning among remnants of 3-d ruler modeling
among remnants of augmented reality maquettes
what was augmented is background
what is foregrounded is measured
the ruler measures the ruler
the foreground measures the background
turning background into flesh, foreground into fetish
foreground into flesh, background into fetish

Movements are drawn from reprogrammed motion capture equipment. Planetary1 
has no 'stars' to establish scale; these could be sub-atomic particle 
clouds for all we know, or a throwback to the Rutherford atom. Planetary2 
sets 'stars'; the image is reminiscent of NASA footage, with one important 
exception: the planets, not the stars, twinkle. However, if you imagine 
the view from a spacecraft, the planetary twinkle indicates fast rotation, 
and the stars glow more or less evenly. If this is 'read as' planetary, 
certainly indexical; if mocap, it's ikonic (?); and if particle clouds, 
symbolic (?). But these categories are blurred here; virtuality doesn't 
help (especially when the virtual implies inscription and/or an 
imaginary). (Come to think of it, virtuality might not imply an imaginary 
- this is also blurred. In any case they're just animations - something 
NASA does best.)
