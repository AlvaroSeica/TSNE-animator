_The Signifier's Wet, Spit out the Signifier! I Exist_


Excess or supplement of the signifier, dripping off the edge of the graph-
eme - or smearing, diapers, ink - shit everywhere - pissed books _(drag
shadows)_ -

absolute as projective language - develops an anemia - thinned blood -
pushes the rim of the asshole out - paste smeared upon the supine body of
the young girl or young boy _(crash drugs)_ -

diffusion of violence - perfect breasts, milk and blood between them, bet-
ween one and the other - the man or woman harbors both _(capacitance)_ -

diffusion of place, placelessness - machinery searching for a site - in-
side the cunt, against the wall motherfucker - swelling the anemic prick -
almost catastrophic - it can't hold on, can't hold itself _(heads blown)_
-

one, two, a million Oedipals - piss runs from my panties, cracks and cre-
vices, I suck your obdurate foot, your weight upon it - your stump, path-
way into cunt - I can smell it - step on me - sucking toes, the arch of it
- swallow _(nothing)_ -

absolute drawing the text out of itself - text leaks onto the floor - wipe
your ass with it, eat it - taste of your hole - your piss filling me - I
say whatever you want me to - I repeat myself, repeat you - say I exist -
say anything - whatever you want _(nothing)_ -

panties fissuring - break me open - you can see the walls of my hole -
stalagmites, stalactites - something's written there - illegible - you
make me read it - I exit _(drag shadows)_ -

embarrassment resulting in speechlessness - you watch me - I stink in your
eyes - your foot in my mouth, deeper - can hardly breathe - covered with
your shit - my breasts are bruised, torn _(drag shadow biotech)_ -

self-censoring - can't imagine saying anything - mouth filled with piss - 
hose disconnects, repeats itself - the cycle continues - sixty cycles a 
second _(crash drugs hard)_ -

exploitation of the secret life - optical disk transference - I exist - 
leaked out onto the floor - beneath the table - in the hole _(crash 
drugs. nothing)_ -

in the groundfloor of normalcy _(drug shadows. hard.)_ -
