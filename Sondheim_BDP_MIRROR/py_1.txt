falter

faltering because falling through black-space
in and out of black space
doing the avatar dance faltering while falling
"The joy the avatar brings to the world's cold winter is the joy of
weatherless dance and limbs akimbo."
doing the avatar dance and weathering the world outside
which is characterized by inclemency, immobility, dissolution of all
sustenance that humans hold good
"Creatures are nourished within themselves in innocence, and it is
this nourishment which parallels the other."
faltering because every step topples every other
there are infinite normal modes in a linear system with longitudinal
waves composed of equally-spaced and weighted spheres, and for all
purposes, from avadance to avasound, these normal modes are not
harmonic
they exist in irrational relationships to one another
the boundary conditions might or might not be equivalent
any ongoing configuration of the nodes under any excitation except
for null excitation never returns to any particular state; each
state appears once, each state is defined by dx/dt and the very
characterization of a state is problematic
not to mention the issue of noise in the system for we are 
considering an ideal system, one formed within the geodesics, 
coordinates, and matrices, not to mention multi-dimensional arrays
and indices, not to mention noise among the indices as they 
increase perhaps infinitely
"The state is constituted by flux, porous and fuzzy boundaries,
and avadance is a just response to the very condition of the 
state, which cannot catch a fleeing avatar."
Kira Sedlock: "Avadance is what I call what we do when we dance
like avatars, but how do avatars dance?"
Azure Carter: "They are always in flight."
Foofwa d'Imobilite: "Aren't we all."
not to mention the irregular lines of flight or chreods which only
appear to follow trajectories, but within these multi-dimensional
manifolds, anything goes, you never know what is crossing what, or
what will take you where
virtual solid manifolds possess the potential energy of faltering
they exist in irrational relationships to one another, in other 
words they hardly have any reason within the space for appearing
as-such or perhaps hardly any reason without the space as well,
that is, outside the space or within the space of the presencing 
of the space within.
but of course there are reasons, and reasons and reasons, and one
might as well think of avadance as that surplus which has nothing
to do with any of this, faltering on the high-beam or uneven bars,
for example, not exactly anything anyone would want to do
but there are crowds and audiences anyone may learn avadance
Maud Liardon: "Do you say 'learn avadance' or 'learn to avadance'?"
or falter, that's what one might do in these occasions
what occasions if not all occasions
that's the kink in the chain that brings it back to the start,
here is a faltering avadancer as sutured knot, closing the manifold
all over again
Alan Sondheim: "Avadancers never falter."
they never falter because escape the halter, they ought to totter:
avadance
they come to greet hir: avadance
on the way down: avadance
on the way up: avadance
suturing with needle and thread, not here, not there, avadancer!
open the manifolds: avadancer!
falter failure: avadancer!
s/he's out of here here. 
they're out of here.

improvisation song radio

extended 20 minute improvisation experiment -
(including warmup - the sound imaginary begins to coalesce, thicken 
- a riff in octaves emerges, sinks)

http://www.alansondheim.org/cat.mp3

3 songs immediately following improvisation
(slower song-forms insisting on defusing chaos)

a new push on an object grouping that continued almost indefinitely

into a sky that was hardly drawn, that flowed from the memory of drawing.
it took so long to return to earth, i.e. to level 0 of the virtual world.
here we are extending into a problematic of the push.
falter, yes, failure, yes, fall, yes, flight, yes, but the originary
moment of the push, that decision to extend uselessly. 
for there is nothing above and what is below is at an inconceivable 
distance.
which means a large difference between, say, 4000 and 5 in terms of what 
appears as verticality.
there is a particular _speed_ involved, the speed of flight and, perhaps 
later the speed of falling.
the speed neither increases nor decreases; the speed is a constant, as are 
the piped-in sounds of the wind.
of course all of this is nothing more than a _calculation,_ as I have 
repeatedly stressed. 
but these particular pushes carry a resonance all their own - the loneli- 
ness of the isolated universe or wheel, the inability to garner community
as someone somewhere moves a mouse, operates a keyboard, wears whatever 
gear she might find necessary, and then he is there, preposterous, nowhere 
at all, but with the implication of _above._
and continued almost indefinitely? or with the boundary conditions set 
somewhere before _now,_ perhaps the length of a number of hours: she 
sleeps.

someday someone will look at these and think here is a documentation that 
lasts perhaps eight months - an installation constantly undergoing change 
in a manner that suggests perhaps psychoanalytical mathemes or a journey 
early on, into the creation and inhabitation of alien worlds. or perhaps 
suggestion of nothing more than an 'unhealthy obsession' as if worlds had 
only the potential for extractive industries, and those for only a brief 
time before things came to a head, the flattening of mountains on neutron 
stars for example. in any case i realized a simple fact-germane today - 
that i will know neither or sun the day after my death - and this sent me 
once more into weeping and the suffering of weeping, as if these creations 
tottered on an unnameable brink, and what would that be, what would that 
be ...


inkblood

making of suicide hieroglyph
construct of last poem signifier ever
day of julu twine death and resurrection
double pens in blood and image

i want to do this for you but you may not find a place
to stand next to me. and what a meaningless performance
which is its strength. 'strengths' is the longest word
in english with a single vowel. or so i believe! and it
is one of the strengths of this piece that 'strengths'
is embodied in the very movements of julu twine, which
are in turn embodied in a series of still and moving
images. 

when i finished inkblood i didn't know
that ink would flow like that, or glow
beneath the water, like so much slaughter.
julu's entwined in symbols, caught in words
mute with movement, so many token herds
on the way to slaughter, beneath the water.
every symbol tends towards awkward breath
forgetting birth and on the way to death
beneath the water, escaping certain slaughter.
beyond their slaughter, breath of glowing words
beneath the water, death of knowing herds.


banging into it

I keep banging into the thing and the thing doesn't move.
where could the thing move. the thing couldn't move.
s/he pushes hir desire to the limit of WRYTHING.
WRYTHING = WRYTING where the push goes.
to inscribe = to PUSH.
in/scribe = into the BODY no matter where it is.
what the substance is where BODY = NO MATTER.
doesn't everyone memorize inscription?
PUSH it in but first create a clearing: s/he WRYTES at night.
it is at night that the words glow and PUSH into the sky.
in a SECOND LIFE: PUSH into a sky that does not PUSH back.
ah it is only a matter of reason suspended in the middle of the air!
ah it is only a matter of the reason of dropping fruit!
it is a matter of the fruit!
 
I am writing this: "I WRYTE myself into existence.
I am writing this: "I WRYTE myself out of existence."

a couple is sitting next to me PUSHING into each other, WRYTING
each other, the compact of the GYFT, mutual INSCRIPTION, let me
de/scribe their HAND. it is in the AYRE which does not PUSH BACK
not yet, it is a matter of time, it is a MATTER between them,
they help each other into their COATS, it is cold out, they need
warmth and then leaving and behind them passing on.

where could the thing move? where do they WRYTHE?

architecture for a new year:

shapes matter less than the comfort that coheres within them.
outside assume vagaries and opposition.
architectures as transitional objects.
living within the teddy-bear.
in the Second Life installation: dynamic micro-architectures of 
deconstruction and enclosure.
no entrances, no exits: one appears, disappears.
what constitutes coming and going are virtual particles = people.
virtual to the extent that one passes through doors and walls:
one passes through flats, nodes, and textures. 
nothing is comfortable when the transitional turns on you.
Second Life = transitional object = preparation for virtual life.
real life = virtual life; body = inscription; wryting = body;
uncanny = inscription; world = word; word = idiotic.
micro-architectures of the visible: setting up the camera image
just so: harboring time of day, weather, height, distance from
avatar or avatar viewpoint, location beneath the ground or water
surface or clothing, location in collusion with sheave-skin,
moment of capture = arrangement of objects in flight.
micro-architectures within objects in flight: buildings escaped
from occupants, homes escaped from families, dwellings escaped
from inhabitants, bodies escaped from inscription.
bodies escaped from inscription: debris of the body, abjection.
abjection in micro-architecture: no place to sit, no place to
lie: an avatar never lies. 
no place to sleep: an avatar never sleeps; no place to declare:
an avatar tells the truth.
coordinates, program, language, protocol, code, alphanumerics,
binary oppositions: the truth of anything unforsaken in the 
saying of it.
micro-architectures: between code and architecture.

the bone-frame was made for
no suck shock knit within terror,
yet the skeleton stood up to it:

the flesh? it was melted away,
the heart burnt out, dead ember,
tendons, muscles shattered, outer husk dismembered,

yet the frame held: 
we passed the flame: we wonder
what saved us? what for?

(from H.D., The Walls Do Not Fall)

dojoji pushes from the ground up and up, s/he, rising,
makes rocket of worlds, they thrust, vector dust
behind them. sullen s/he stops, about to fall; vector
turns to cloud, heaves and hovers, shadow left behind
fades, halo against trim support. you might ask one
or another, fail or falter an answer: these worlds are
left alone, sheave and bone. but an answer: in front
of some dim orb, something seated, or at rest, moves,
and here too something moves, response and nocturne.
dojoji follows suit, follows through, as long as presence
murmurs. hir worlds teeter, turn and wobble, throb:
if any there be, this amazes among no other, this rock,
this rocket, sheave-skin hovered in sky-skin, earth-skin,
sun- and moon-skin in early dawn or dusk, of which,
there is no matter.

writing under migraine
writing this with eyes shut - the light flashes are brilliant, slight buzz 
in the eas, the usual reverse-C pattern is distroted, ragged, for some 
reason - not sure - the strokes are identical though - except there are 
blue/black/yellow-white - perhaps why I find those colors hideous? in the 
middle of the installation mostly pinks and reds, tissue, but yes, an 
avoidance of this. convera=sation behind me, loud, we're in a cafe, I 
don't want to go out into the sunlight p it would be too much to handle. 
coupled with a second a few days ago and coupled further with a crisis 
i've been going through, worry abou surviving it the insomnia raging 
although last night i took ambien for the first time might be contributing 
to the migraine, not sure - reverse C into Z - it's not staying table, 
slight nausea  growing a bit this is severe - thinking as Azure says 
worried about me for the first time actually feeling as if i'm old, think 
that hit after not getting the wvu grants so we're disconnected from that 
university - the result is no university affiliation and back in the loft 
talking to myself, that kind of garrett writing that doesn't do anyone any 
good internet notwithsatnding - so the result - that the writing seeps out 
becomes maudlin - that piece i just sent out with the text that was then 
modified several times - i think it was yesterday morning - the 
modifications are great, the first paragraph hideous - i don't seem to be 
able to get byeond the hideous at this point - the Z- has warped into a 
blunted v-shaped pattern with wide separation  the geometry's not constant 
here - topology is - it's moved to the upper and lower portions of the 
visual field with closed eye s- wonder why for me it always opens to the 
left - in other words revser C which is non-symmetric - headache slightly 
more inthe perfrontal right lobe i think - well fells it's from there, who 
knows - on the left side more of a dull beat - breating irregular - every 
night i think - i'm going to die soon, i've done nothing, i wont know the 
weather the next day, what azure will think or say the morning after, 
whether our cat will miss me - well this brings tears to my eyes - this is 
totally self indulgent but it's my own personal hell which grows day by 
day at thispoint - there's no literature in it - heard Lyotard was 
frightened beyod elief before he died - David Bohm almost collapsee d - I 
think maybe did collapse -- over insecurity in terms of where he was 
living - we're up i the air GIVE US A REASON TO COME AND WE'LL BE THERE, 
but who would want to hideous slouching behind azure, the pattern has gone 
down to a signnle line or the other is outside the visual field which is 
iteresting, there's a color change,  some sortof dull sphere on the lower 
right, i have no explanation for this but a pool where the zigzag seems to 
be gathering - someone just gave me two advil  well when i began typing 
this, perhaps that is making the change, the headache has moved from the 
frontal to the right-hand brain top and more to the right-side the left 
it's gone away, the nauseua is increasing, slight panic attack coming on i 
must look ridiculous typing this i a restaurant eyes closed - i just want 
to know i have a few years maybe a decade left - just to keep working - 
i'm knowing nothing, the little success i'm having i wish i had decades 
ago when i could have appreciated it - now i'm a relic - playing agan 
january 25 - this all based on stuff recorded in the 50s at leat they 
allow me to record again at times -- i worry aboutesp-disk and its 
reputation although at least now they're trying to set things right - 
maybe it will work, esp was in an inpossible situation but not as 
impossible as the musicians, music pounding into my head although it's 
low, something popular, i don't know, i don't know popular tunes - just a 
remanant up the upper right, a few flashes and reverberations, vibrations, 
that's all, the field is gone, the headache is a bit stronger, isn't that 
how it always is, i sho0uld leave here, aking a spectacle of myself, im 
not blind, what am i doing typing away, probably mistake after mistake, 
sometimes i catch them - for all i know my hands have slipped on the keys 
- that's what my life has een like - keys sllippe all over the place - i 
regret my regrets, that's about as dead and dull as it gets... will stop 
now don't want to bore you, it sounds like someone is singing on and on, 
that's on wait, on and on, think i have that right, i'm not breathig 
enough - more tests and sleep clinic coming up, alreadyhad xrays and 
consultations and bloodwork twice, something is bound to show up, idon't 
want to live like this, it burdens mywork, infects it...



Self-Induction


From Johnson's Dictionary:

Aporia: A figure in rhetorick, by which the speaker shews, that he doubts 
where to begin for the multitude of matter, or what to say in some strange 
and ambiguous thing; and doth, as it were, argue the case with himself.

Aposiopesis: A form of speech, by which the speaker, through some 
affection, as sorrow, bashfulness, fear, anger, or vehemency, breaks off 
his speech before it be all ended. A figure, when, seeking of a thing, we 
yet seem to conceal it, though indeed we aggravate it, or when the course 
of the sentence begun is so stayed, as thereby some part of the sentence, 
not being uttered, may be understood. - Smith

Aporrhoea: Effluvium; emanation; something emitted by another. Not in use.

Art: [first definition, only one close art-making of any sort] The power 
of doing something not taught by nature and instinct; as, to walk is 
natural, to dance is an art.


>> Recursion in Second Life: automated vertical movement with Dojoji 
seated on fleeing object = self-fleeing object (movement in determined 
stages). There are 125 megabytes of files here but the phenomenon is 
unusual and has been more or less captured; check out 
http://www.alansondheim.org/ for self-induction pngs, .mov, and .mp4. The 
rise seems to top out at 4117 SL units; at least on this occasion, every- 
thing stopped. Falling objects (the ones not immediately above the 
rocket-prim) meander down, often go off-world. 

>> Or not exactly recursion but a repetitive act which constantly steps-up 
as object moves, dragging the catalyst with it (catalyst seated on object, 
object as catalyst-bed): the prey flees the hunter who rides on its back - 
but of course the hunter never catches the pray, which drags the hunter 
along with it. Or rather, the parasite move the thing and thereby creates 
a vector, exploration, culture.

>> But each particular command, each action is limited; this is not a 
continuous automated movement but a movement relying on a performative 
repeatedly called upon - there is a double level at work, the level of the 
script creating flight, and the level of the avatar Dojoji following suit. 
In this Dojoji is not only passive but seated.

>> Therefore it is in the level and performative of the signal itself that 
flight is initiated, which is then carried out for the set amount of time 
by the script. Think of this as an autonomic nervous system, sensing and 
reacting on a quantum level and thereby constructing a chain of events 
which continue until what might be a ceiling is reached - in which case 
the whole thing stalls. Note that the ceiling may well be artificial, a 
result of my computer at this end acting upon the chain, as I attempted to 
record everything going on.

>> And of course what is going on is _miniscule_; the excitement lies in 
the (false) glimmerings of artificial life as the total local environ- 
ment - call this the _habitus_ takes over from the avatar controller and 
makes a line for itself.

>> Why _self-induction_? Because the avatar and object-environment, con- 
sidered as a _single_ objects, acts reflexively upon itself, just as a 
coil for example self-induces. Let the initial charge be the establishment 
of the circuit by the avatar controller, and the continuous charging, much 
as occurs in an induction (spark) coil be the result of self-action - the 
rest follows suit.

>> Of course this is at best a metaphor; still, one can imagine a _system_ 
of objects, scripts, and avatars, interacting as if in mid-air in Second 
Life, producing the equivalent of simple binary circuits. Two possible 
models (among many): simple calculation; and cellular automata behavior.


From Francis Bacon, The Great Instauration:

The practical doctrine of nature we necessarily divide into two parts, 
corresponding to those of speculative; for physics, or the inquiry of 
efficient and material causes, produces mechanics; and metaphysics, the 
inquiry of forms, produces magic; whilst the inquiry of final causes is a 
barren thing, or as a virgin consecrated to God.


How to view The Accidental Artist exhibition in Second Life

The exhibition is quite complex now. Here's some suggestion when visiting:

1. Try turning the glow off. Go to preferences, graphics, and uncheck 
basic shading, if it's on. Basic shading seems to use up more resources 
than anything else with the rendering engine. You can also set things like 
rendering distance; the lower the distance, the faster the loading.

2. Turn the video media button off. This on the lower right-hand corner of 
the screen. If you turn it on, the texture-mapping consumes a huge amount 
of resources. On the other hand, the audio for the parcel (the audio 
button) runs fairly lean.

3. If you find the space too cluttered to enter, try flying in.

4. If you find flying in too cluttered, fly higher, and drop in. There is 
a dome in the center of the space which you can enter.

5. Most objects on the ground level (and some beneath the ground, on the 
seafloor) will flee from you - what looks crowded from a distance might 
well clear out.

6. If it clears out, look up - you'll see all sorts of things above you.

7. Fly vertically to see the rest of the exhibition. If you can't fly as 
high as you want, click control-alt-d, which opens up an advanced menu. 
Open the menu and get rid of camera constraints. You can then move the 
camera at a great distance from your avatar body - your viewpoint moves 
independently, and you can move at least to the top of the exhibition, 
which is maybe a mile or so up, SL measurement.

8. If you get stuck anywhere, teleport back in.

9. Try moving inside the objects; the interior textures are often 
different from the exterior ones (this is almost always the case with the 
spheres).

10. You can push objects vertically into the sky by moving beneath them 
and flying; they flee upwards.

11. You can see the exhibition 'differently' by using the advanced menu, 
going to render, and then looking for info - clicking on any one of the 
info options will give you different viewpoints.

12. You can often sit on moving objects, which will whirl you around; if 
you sit on an object that moves vertically as a result of your proximity, 
you can ride it up. When you stand up again, you can fall down back into 
the space. The riding height seems to be around 4117 SL units, but unless 
you have a flight bracelet or feather, you probably won't go that high.

13. Moving about on the ground level, keep the sound turned on (lower 
right), and you'll hear a variety of songs about SL and language. These 
mix with a number of looping sound modules embedded in the space.

14. Go to 
http://www.kippiefriedkin.com/resources/secondlife-viewer-cheatsheet.pdf
and you'll find shortcuts for all sorts of rendering possibilities; most 
of these are also available in the menu or advanced menu. 

15. If you've been moving around SL a lot, go to preferences, and empty 
your cache; this might speed things up. You'll have to restart SL again.

16. If you see a sign for teleporting, try it. Sometimes it will lead back 
to the ground level, sometimes to the seabed, sometimes to a skysphere. 
All of these locations have clickable objects which will take you else- 
where (or back to the same space but at a slightly different location). 
You might have to right-click on the object, then click on teleport - or 
you might just left click - it depends on the object.

17, Try different 'lenses' - click on control-8 to make the image wide- 
angle, control-9 to return to normal, control-0 for telephoto. Repeated 
clicks work as well - with control-8 you can create extreme distortions.

18, Try moving into 'small' spaces and look about. You can save snapshots 
of anything you see, on your hard drive.

19. That's about it. The general idea is to run lean, fly about, teleport 
back if you're stuck, play with the controls. The architecture is constan- 
tly changing and deconstructing itself - play with that....

To go into the space, as always, go to secondlife.com, get an avatar, go 
through the initial 'training' which is usually under five minutes, then 
click on the URL below:

http://slurl.com/secondlife/Odyssey/48/12/22

Let me know if you have any difficulties.

lurid seducing objects

a new push on an lurid object groping that continued almost indefinitely - 
seduction architectures as lurid objects. Second Life = lurid object 
preparation for virtual life. moment of capture = arrangement of lurid 
objects in flight. micro-architectures within lurid objects in flight: boy 
or girl escaped like bad lurid objects pause then something dark remarks 
the car where is it - lurid objects pause then something dark remarks

 like bad lurid objects pause then something like bad
 lurid objects pause then something dark remarks the car where is it 
 lurid objects pause then something 

seated on fleeing lurid object = self-fleeing lurid object (the movement 
determined, the thing stopped - the man or woman seduced).

falling lurid objects - the ones not immediately above as the lurid object 
moves, dragging the catalyst with it (catalyst seated on lurid object, 
lurid object as catalyst-bed): the prey flees the hunter who rides on hir 
back -

why _self-induction_? because hir lurid object-environment, considered as 
a _single_ lurid object, acts reflexively upon itself, just as lurid 
objects, scripts, and avatars interact as if in mid-air in Second Life.

most lurid objects on the ground level (and some beneath the ground, 
undersea - try seducing inside the lurid lures; the interior textures are 
often seducing. you can push lurid objects, sheave-skinned boy or girl, 
man or woman, vertically into the sky by seducing beneath them.

you can often sit on seducing lurid objects, which will whirl you around; 
if you sit on a lurid object that moves vertically as a result of your 
proximity, s/he is a seducing lurid object.

all of these locations have clickable lurid objects which will take you - 
you might have to right-click on the lurid lure, then click on teleport - 
or you might just left click - it depends on the lurid lure.

postlude to a high-jacking prelude to a crash

stumped.

http://www.alansondheim.org/stump.png

logged out of the virtual world. informed that the 'parcel' was unavail- 
able so would set me down into a neighbor one - which turned out to be 
'mature' - a lot of confused 'gray people' milling about. teleported out 
back to odyssey seemed in disorder (see prelude). the next stage was a 
frozen screen coupled with stuttered sound and the world crashed. how 
often this occurs! what is the safe word as i sit here, dojoji, typing 
away - the word that would bring me back. -

performance mismatch didn't meet up and in any case here are results:

http://www.alansondheim.org/ broke pngs

teleportation over distances of 2-10 meters, self-teleport attached to 
dojoji, dead-end sex all over the place. the dance that is worked. the 
dance that is worked out. 

julu dance dojoji dance twine dance aylan.
ju'lu dance do'jo'ji dance twine dance ay'lan.

strange mating dance of julu dojoji and aylan twine.
behavior collision striated potentials across V-field flux.

all objects talk and jabble in the sward. sheave-skins collude. it's a 
game or trick. when you're driven elsewhere there's always sex to listen 
to. it's always sex you hear. jabbled couplings. 

touch me body-tactile space jumps you about. you jump near the thing you 
see the thing touch the thing you do not touch the thing. thing jumps you 
about. you do not smell the thing you do not hear the thing. thing jumps 
you away. touch thing = away.

when the meet

when they dance for joy

when they meet up here there is an offering each makes to the other, but 
neither can procure touch; everything revolves around, resolves within, 
the lineage of sight, citation, site. sight, citation, site = permissions 
= property, intellectual, flesh, sheave-skin. what might be traded might 
be taken back. what is given is never lost. 

what happens is that they take time to load and sometimes the clothing - 
julu's contraptions for example - don't load - s/he appears naked 'in the 
ordinary sense' - dojoji without the apparatus on the other hand has no 
organ at all. what happens when they meet - they remain at a distance - 
nothing touches - there's nothing there to touch, nothing there to do the 
touching - this is called an 'encounter,' this might be called 'intimacy.' 

the sinusoidl delineates bounded spatial regions of avatar and particle 
movement; the regions fade out and change dimensions in a highly trigono- 
metric way.

particle groupings.

For upcoming Arena NW(101,65,37) installation in Second Life:

1. Dropping those objects which have been taken - piled, flight: every- 
thing flees, there's always clear space. 
2. Physical objects: non-phantom, but dropped, held in position, but 
whatever for? 
3. Something tawdry, indigestible. 
4. Flight to such a degree that they soon tunnel out of site (for most 
settings), head out of world - the site has to be _tended,_ constantly 
refurbished. Tended = a tendency to _disappear._
5. To work on _inpenetrable_ sound.
6. To work on transparent non-phantom objects: another position.
7. Intensities as things meld into one another - in the form of a debris 
field.
8. Debris field = Gaza-slaughter. (title?)

I arise early in the morning, after four hours' sleep, which is never 
enough for Chanticleer; later, I will sleep off everything again - most 
likely in the midst of the afternoon. Then my repose enters those vast 
uncharted realms that every Sleeper fears; I never return as I left, but 
in turmoil. My subterfuge is literature; prose lends me its hand when 
times and style perfect their moment of truth. Otherwise, prose envelops 
with difficulty and lassitude, and I am returned, repeatedly, to the 
hustle and bustle of everyday life, a state tending towards more and 
greater nightmares and visitations. As you move through your daylight 
hours of relative tranquility, you might think of me, fighting with 
demons, and never a good fight; it takes energy and acumen I no longer 
have, to keep them all at bay.

description,at least theory, that's here somewhere, but there are so many 
now, it would be impossible, at least with this group, to do more than 
present them, hope you view at least a )few) - then draw your own 
conclusions, the reign of production is constant here, i'm just preparing 
these as a 'new batch' - you understand, at least with this batch, the 
primacy of the visual, notalways though, sometimes hardly at all - the 
theoretical takes over - but these have so many small or large themes, 
mpomments, concepts, what have you - so they might stand on their own, but 
replete, fecund, too much, too many, sdefuge sets in and then there's just 
one more image, the fnal image you'll see before you'r exhausted, and it's

vents and vestments

http://www.alansondheim.org/ vent png series

Perhaps I am too modest in my literary vestments, as if I promised nothing 
but moribund psychedelia for the purpose of entertainment or vision. I 
believe neither in vision nor spirit, and what you see is pretty much all 
there is, philosophical scaffolding notwithstanding. In these instances 
for example, an artificial topography is imposed on the 4-dimensional 
manifold that constitutes Second Life, since behaviors and other dynamic 
actions are equally susceptible under the law and lien of scripts. Here 
are simulacra of vents or smokers, and true to form, the emissions spew 
from somewhere beneath the surface, within a sea best described as _blue 
filter, details falling off, surface ripplings, and refractions as such 
apparently move in a windless, airless, spiritless sky._ Filtration, as 
anyone with sunglasses knows, gives magic to the world, eliminating the 
everyday, as if emphasis were the result of fecundity, not reduction.

Now, here, nothing is promised, no premise, but that of the _index_ which, 
as governor or government, governs all things, all processes, all splayed 
and displayed solids, liquids, gases, and plasmas, such as are reconsti- 
tuted in the virtual environment of Second Life. 

As the poet Thomas Holley Chivers says, 

Like two spirits in one being,
  Were our souls, dear Isadore!
Every object singly seeing--
In all things, like one, agreeing
  In those halcyon days of yore.
We shall live so in our being
  Up in Heaven, dear Isadore!

There have been so many of the variety of _amanuensis,_ from Jennifer and 
Julu to Nikuko, from Doctor Leopold Konninger and Travis to Aylan, from 
Clara through Honey - and all of the many other emanants who have given 
time and space, duty and behavior, to what may only be considered a use- 
less or quixotic enterprise. And how lonely the 'only' in that sentence, 
an isolated fabrication, meaningless to the deepest degree, _only_ imbued 
what what we can bring to it! If this were not spirit, nothing is; if this 
is spirit, nothing _is._

Non-phantom objects. New ground clearance. New ground clearance in the

Complaynte of Numbers

1. There's no danger, I was about to put up images of cables inserted into 
rectum and vagina, a means of internal recording motion capture with a 
more than singular node. I decided against this, giving in to censorship 
and the deepest desire not to offend, not to antagonize, not to be 
antagonized, not to be offended, not to be under attack. Cowardice!
2. There's no danger, part-objects flying about everywhere. In the central 
sphere or grounded skysphere, two floor panels slide against one another 
and everything and everyone contributes to a story about power and body, 
sex and longing, death above all else.
3. There's danger. At night I think of dying, I no longer sleep. At three 
in the morning, now early and late for me, I erased my inbox; I no longer 
think clearly, the world is fuzzy and I bumble about utterly exhausted.
4. There's more than danger with somewhat blurred vision in both eyes: 
what am I looking at? Why am I looking.
5. There's more than anything. At night I think of dying. And I implore 
you, I more than implore you: download everything from my site, as soon as 
possible. Do this once a month once every other month. I am unsuccessful 
in publishing; my work is online, fragile, always close to elimination. 
Download and keep the texts alive after I'm gone.
6. There's more than nothing. After I'm gone someone will see images of 
this exhibition or other work, perhaps read a text or listen to some sound 
and that will begin a _process of recuperation,_ re-installation. Dead, it 
will do me no good, just as the mini-revival of my albums and some new 
ones do me no good now; it's too late, I'm too close to death or at least 
far too close to thinking about anything else.
7. Nineteenth century humor, for example Thackeray's writings for Punch, 
just doesn't seem funny - there goes the structuralist accounting for the 
phenomenon, as far as I'm concerned. Something else is at work, something 
untoward, something untoward this way comes.
8. If my work were to survive on your hard drive, then who will comprehend 
any of it in the future? In West Virginia, we were happy; I had a lab, we 
rented a small house, there were birds, I had an assistant who could 
program, we could explore one strange place after another, we had good 
and easy-going friends who made no demands, and we made none in return. 
Most importantly, my work had a context, people who were interested in it, 
the possibility of publication, public talks, a conference. Returning to 
New York, with everything suddenly cut off, I no longer sleep, collapse, 
am collapsed, wait for a _reconciliation_ with my own body of work which 
never comes.
9. Second Life nauseates, defuge sets in; the fact that new pieces are 
installed and the whole tuned almost daily doesn't help when so few people 
visit. I've had over 1600 over a period of months, something a website 
might get in half a day. I recognize the difficulty of navigating and even 
beginning Second Life, but there's the possibility of exploring an entire 
virtual and new world 'out there' and how often does that happen?
10. In sleeplessness today I thought of writing about my enemy encounters 
with V.A, B.M., G.S., D.G., so many others, but already I fear giving more 
than getting, the names reduce to initials out of a cowardice that won't 
let me alone.
11. So much sexuality in the Second Life installation - faces, organs, 
some arms and feet, no full or replete bodies, at least none that I 
remember. Literally I lay myself on the line, cut myself off. I want 
friendship without the premise or promise of death. The faces and organs 
spell words and murmur, the hands and feet sign themselves in and out of 
existence, I pretend to write through blurred vision, an experiment, 
through greater and greater sleep deprivation, an experiment, through 
double melatonins and wine, through noise-machines and temperature 
control. 
12. Let me see, I'd say something about the Middle-East.

more than the usual gender confusion as I altered alan (aylan) dojoji's 
body with ready-mades and then removed them, so here are the results.
of course I was surprised. so this is the premise of a series of images 
which might as well expand into something else, as usual:

packed analysis

the physics engines in virtual worlds lead to holes and confusions; what- 
isthis i don't know, something swooped by; it's probably one of mine 
however ownership is defined; in telejump incremental teleports tending 
towards the same location consistently jump the avatar around on what 
might be considered an acre of space or so; the jumps appear random; they 
have to be determined; there's no weather only whether; that's more 
profound than it might seem to be; on first reading; after a while working 
in these space you pay more attention to the tropes; i remember our first 
travels in the everglades; we'd look at the alligators and larger fauna in 
general; after a while we were down to the level of insects and periphy- 
ton; our living in the world changed in relation to the increasing depth 
of our knowledge of the land; going from macro- to micro-scopic; beginning 
to comprehend the skein of that part of the world; in second life some- 
thing similar happens but to a lesser degree; there's nothing all the way 
down or rather the plateau is shallower; that makes virtual worlds all the 
safer; not to mention the lack of alterity, at last so far; you can always 
log out; nothing follows you; you're always already in the process of 
being-born; there's no annihilation; you might disappear for a while; you 
might in fact vanish; what jon marshall calls 'ascence'; the states are 
always mixed, superimposed, in-between; but without depth; there's no 
laterality; no continuum; so the symptoms themselves become obdurate; as 
if there were a depleted and impoverished granularity to the world; that 
granularity and no further; for that matter the physics itself peters out; 
you wouldn't get for example quantum phenomena on the scale of the bit; or 
at least you might get at best some sort of formulaic approach; on the 
other hand the grain of space-time might well meet the grain of gamespace; 
on the order of dozens of magnitudes smaller; where you're playing is safe 
that way; there's no holes to fall through; games survive miraculous hacks 
but they don't survive corporate collapse; except as remnants or reminders 
of saved databases; saved in part; like the programmed texts in moos or 
muds; so i'm a virtual-worker like a sex-worker or cultural- worker; so in 
clearing grounds or trying out one thing or another i notice stuff; like 
the texture moving by at high speed or the avatar telejump to nowhere as 
if it were out of control; that's perception for you; one might think if 
one believed anything that god was a game-engine; that's not in the 
subjunctive; so a virtual-worker gives hirself to the game; hir safe-self; 
there's no turtles all the way down; the void is parameterized; for that 
matter emptiness; which takes on the quality of an ontology within the 
virtual; that much is clear;

Uqbar Debris Field show documentation:

In regard to the Debris Field Uqbar show below:

The column reached the maximum height in Second Life, 4110m or 4.1k up. 
Beyond that, objects fall off the world or refuse to be placed anywhere. 
The column contains various debris fields on the way up. The ground has 
had a number of textures, including almost invisible ones, added in com- 
bination with texts; all of the texted objects are teleport objects and 
will send an avatar on random and peculiar journeys.

There are 156 still images, although I self-censored two that might be 
read as pornographic; check out http://www.alansondheim.org/ arena jpgs. 
There is also a short video http://www.alansondheim.org/4kfall.mp4 of 
Dojoji falling through the middle of the 4k column from the top. The 
performance is tomorrow, with Sandy Baldwin and myself. Azure also has a 
new song debut in the space. Check it out if you can.

(I had to remove some of the Odyssey images to make room for the 156 here 
but I'm quite happy to do this, since Odyssey was built around an archi- 
tecture, and this is more free-range.) 

Here is the announcement:
