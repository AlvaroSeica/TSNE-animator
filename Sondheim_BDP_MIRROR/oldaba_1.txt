Sweet Honey.com Duplicate lasciviously pouring down the throat with no
loss at all, an excellent taste in the mouth of course; in.com gives out
what goes in; love.com is lost forever, gone with no regard.  As it is in
this tired old world of ours, so it is on our tired old Net. May the New
Millennium bring plentitude anywhere, our bellies full of packets, our
minds full of food.
