Subject:       Screen Phenomena







When is `representation' a torn membrane or VEIL; when is VERONICA

not Boolean, but gesture? Ontological phenomena are always already an

ASIDE...



I am sending this to myself; you are a spinoff of this activity,

useful for textual preservation. Ah, how often during the middle of

the night does email lock-up, the screen petrified or frozen, a

crystalline slice of thought, going nowhere and lost forever! The

natural always takes its toll; a storm in the North Atlantic destroys

absolutely and forever the fragility of thinking! I return over and

over again to the imaginary of the screen, presented against your

chosen color, a framework for the saccadic and twisted movement of

your eye itself.



It is this movement that fixes or fetishizes the net, which extends

in a laminar coagulation beyond the screen, surrounding it, but

always making way. The screen begins and ends, a terminal within a

terminal, a foundation soldered to a wiring leading to ever more

complex ultra large-scale integrated circuits, increasingly three-

dimensional. They prepare the way! They prepare everything  for you!



The screen is THIS PLEASURE for the eye which I would fill with the

presence of my body or your own. It is the margin of dangerous

fantasy, what propels one always beyond what is apparently possible

to construct. The edge of the screen is the blade of a knife, a

quadruple-blade cutting through the four quadrants, by extrapolation,

through the three-dimensional octants themselves.



You transform each and every representation, by virtue of protocol,

camouflage, or terminal emulation. Every screen act is one of

mimickry; your fears and desires, which are identical, reside within

it. ASCII text always aligns itself with the rectangular...
