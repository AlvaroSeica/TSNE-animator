sonnet written on my birthday


strange things roam the world when faces
lift off faces to become faces of the world
telling and telling of the world
and the strange things they have seen
and what they call these things, and what
these things are, separated by their birth,
by commas and other things; and then,
once things have started to become things,
once the thing is born, it spreads, like     (once the things are born,
illness across the faces of the world,        they spread
making things for the telling, telling
always of other things, this is called the
crisis and capital of things, insomniac,
naming, making things from things
