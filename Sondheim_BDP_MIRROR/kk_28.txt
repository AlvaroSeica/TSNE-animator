Emily's Riddle


"Who they are and what they really do behind the golden doors of their
"scandal-ridden world. [...] so-called fashionable people. [...]
"the most glittering, scandalous social set in the world today. 
"What we already know about them has been enough to change the way
"we dress and talk and behave. [...] the dazzling, sophisticated ones 
"who set the style in what to wear, where to go, what to do." [...]
"what goes on in their very special, very swinging, utterly exclusive
"world."

Who are these people, what is their set, where are they now?






























The Beautiful People, the Jet Set. Many have died, some are missing,
some have gone out of the public eye like Veruschka, some are shadow
figures like Twiggy, some are oddly present like Vidal Sassoon; some,
like Jackie Kennedy, are missed, and some, like Truman Capote, have
almost been forgotten, no matter the power they appeared to hold so
many years ago. And what of Gore Vidal or Lee Radziwill, or Princess
Grace (Kelly), who has died so tragically, reminding one of Di, of 
course, another tragic Princess, who came so many decades after the
Beautiful People and the Jet Set. I do not know what has happened to
Oleg Cassini and Baby Jane Holzer, but I have read Edie and forget
what happened to Baby Jane, and Bridget Bardot who was always suspect
has become a right-wing animal rights activist. I will dream of Coco
Chanel and her Jet Set.
