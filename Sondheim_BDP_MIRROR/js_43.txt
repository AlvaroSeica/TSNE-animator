Nicholson, A Literary History of the Arabs:


"Mutanabbi on one occasion handed to his patron the copy of an ode which
he had recently composed in his honour, and retired, leaving Sayfu 'l-
Dawla to peruse it at leisure. The prince began to read, and came to these
lines --

  Aqil anil aqti ihmil 'alli salli a'id
  zid hashshi bashshi tafaddal adni surra silli.

  'Pardon, bestow, endow, mount, raise, console, restore,
   Add, laugh, rejoice, bring nigh, show favour, gladden, give!'

Far from being displeased by the poet's aorrogance, Sayfu 'l-Dawla was so
charmed with his artful collocation of fourteen imperatives in a single
verse that he granted every request."

So that I run, jump, leap, lead, desire, turn, love, churn..
               hump, seep, read, retire, learn, rub, burn.. 
so that you stun, thump, creep, bleed, refire, mourn, stub, yearn..
                  stump, heap, heed, rewire, porn, flub, turn..
     ..
Oh my princess, my prince, oh my prince, my princess..  
Oh my princess to be, my prince-to-be, on my prince to be, my princess-
to-be..
     ..
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh. O goddesses O gods.
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh. O gods O goddesses.
