From a Film:

What you see is what you get.

Subscribe to the fullness of the imaginary.

She enjoyed exhibiting herself before men; it was her politics.

She was twisted beyond recognition by the pretense of desire.

Nothing was left but the eternal come-on, left unrewarded but economically
viable.

Her limits were table-dancing and turning the occasional trick.

The wrestling scene was exhausting and humiliating, but full of
competitive spirit.

The girls eventually became her best friends for life.

Always this division between in and out of the business.

Care was always on guard against the presence of males on the periphery.

Her own sex was private and masturbatory, open to anonymous cinematic
eyes.

The film thing was dreary and all too intimate on an uncomfortable level.

She would never turn out for the street.

Males were parasites one way or another in this business.

Both her arms were broken by an angry pimp who just couldn't believe it.

She had never been abused and enjoyed the life and the money.

She worried about the security of it all, and had even given up her habit.
