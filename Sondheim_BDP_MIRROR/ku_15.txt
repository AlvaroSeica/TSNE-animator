<from Nikuko, bombing the I>


"The broadcast, recorded the previous day, and consisting of a text of
815 written characters, coincidentally underlining the day of the broad-
cast, was to inform the Japanese people that Japan had surrendered. The
Emperor spoke, and the people of Japan heard for the first time the Im-
perial 'I,' _'Chin wa,'_ a personal pronoun that exists in the language
for use of only one person, the Emperor of Japan." (from introduction to
Poetry of Ryuichi Tamura, trans. Grolmes and Tsumura. <wa, grammatical
particle, often translated 'as-for'; harmony, total, Japan.>)


  always will speak, says Nikuko, Chin wa, 

      always will       become Nikuko

              like that flash when my eyes opened, 

      it was a coincidence, the flash,

              the eyes opening, 

                      arriving at the same time and close by, 

  once and just once, 

         Chin wa saying once, 

              and that coincidence, 

  when Chin wa                was born

     when Chin wa was subject           of a subject

       particle wa, country wa, your harmony 

   in hir mouth, 

         says Nikuko,

     Chin wa made me like this,           Chin wa flashed

             I am the flash of Chin wa

             I am the flash of Chin wa
