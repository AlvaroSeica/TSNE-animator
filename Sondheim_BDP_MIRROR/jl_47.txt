Jennifer Thinks Through Identity


How can a freighter have _the other side_? What large twirls in the water?
Just so, what is displacement? How is one searching directed?

Just so, these are the questions Jennifer asks, leading to query of iden-
tity, "the major problem," which is Jennifer's freighter, neighbor's Jen-
nifer, freighter's neighbor. 

Identity is not equivalence, nor representation; it is the thing or chao-
tic domain itself, therefore inexhaustible or rather unthinking. I define
this as the _ring of identity_ which is a diacritical of thought attached
to a domain, nothing more; it is insufficient to structure something "id-
entical with itself."

The ring is broken by the presence or procedure of the object; the ring is
neither halo nor aura. 

Thus, "with" or in consideration of, identity, _nothing is being said._ 

The thing closes in upon itself, leaving us speechless.

Identity is silence, silenced; only its negation can be spoken (an elec-
tron may not be identical with itself).

The "its" of "its negation" is problematic. Let me continue, she said. The
freighter was out there beyond the shoreline, out of bounds/binding. 

Identity as silence, speechlessness, absorbs discourse, discursive forma-
tion, and the communicative environment or domain. There is a way of say-
ing that it stands against speech.

It is the gardens of an absent building containing the files of everything
in the world, the worlding of the world. 

Identity is the effacement, _in other words,_ of writing, or non-writing,
the impossibility of being-said here, which _does_ relate to Godel by
circuitous route, as well as the collapse of a scaffold.
