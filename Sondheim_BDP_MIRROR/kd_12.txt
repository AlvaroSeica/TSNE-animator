YOU ARE WRITING TO NOBODY! THIS MESSAGE IS GOING TO NOBODY!


LISTEN UP! LOOSEN UP!

For some, the message below, confused, overly-obscure, obfuscatory in
fact, might tend towards a blankness resonant with the absence of ANY
communication in this damned space. For me, the INCONSISTENCY noted simply
means that, in fact, EVERY ISP is creating its own simulacrum of messaging
- as if there _were_ communication among widely-dispersed peoples - where-
as in fact, it is a _fiction_ created by the world-wide consortium of
interactive governments (WWCIG), which ensure that populations _remain
put._ Why else would an ISP have an UNEXPECTED INCONSISTENCY involving
something as simple as a quota-check from root?


{k:11} /sbin/quotacheck -a
/dev/rsd4a: Permission denied
/dev/rsd2a: Permission denied
THE FOLLOWING FILE SYSTEMS HAD AN UNEXPECTED INCONSISTENCY:
        /dev/rsd4a (/var/mail), /dev/rsd2a (/home)
