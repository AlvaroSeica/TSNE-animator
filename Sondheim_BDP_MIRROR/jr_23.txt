JENNIFER CAN'T GET IN! MOO'S GOING DOWN! BANG! BANG! BANG!


Maat
Papyrus Love the Rush of Thoth on Ka Ba and Kin
Obvious exits: South (to Personal Spaces) and West (to Librynth)
West

Librynth
An Escher rendered real. Bookshelves line each impossible wall; every moment 
is of rich, dark wood (the air is thick with the scent of it.) Angles shift 
and spin slowly -- nothing remains quite as it was, nothing is static. Slowly.
Obvious exits: East (to Maat), North (to Sanctuary), and Up (to Jade
Staircase)
Up

Jade Staircase
You step upon the delicately wrought stair and footfall strikes the 
translucent jade with a faint ringing, the delicate sound of fine steel torn 
through to bone in ancient battles long forgotten.
Obvious exits: Down (to Librynth) and Up (to Zen Pool Hall)
Up

Zen Pool Hall
Exuding infinite quietude. All silence. Words are not better than...be silent.
Obvious exits: Down (to Jade Staircase)
Down

Obvious exits: East (to Maat), North (to Sanctuary), and Up (to Jade
Staircase)

North
You can't go that way.
North
You can't go that way.
North
You can't go that way.
North
You can't go that way.

BANG! BANG! BANG!
I don't understand that.
BANT! BANG! BANG!
I don't understand that.
