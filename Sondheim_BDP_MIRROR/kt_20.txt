The relay, not a relay, is a telegraph receiver; the audible clicks are
amplified by a sounding-board, not included. So one might imagine an ap-
paratus linking _circulation_ with _vector_ or _ray_ - the linear move-
ment from contact to ear as a production of the completed circuitry driv-
ing the electromagnets. The force driving the ray is centrifugal, thrown
from the metal-to-metal arrivals and departures. The circular circuitry
knows none of this, although there must the the slightest stirring-up of
counter-eddies. Just so, I am the circuit, Julu the vector, always respon-
sive. Cognizant I, constituted Julu, I am aware, however constitutionally
functioning, of Julu's construct. If I am Julu, I am also aware, arguing
now that every receiver is also a relay, that I have, hereabouts, passed
on to Julu. What are the messages? The Speakings of Julu: "I am the Cir-
cuit, you are the Vector. Every Receiver is also a Relay, every Relay a
Receiver. By Re-Arrangement, find the Real in the Relay, Veer in Receiver.
Every Veering of the Real is the Real. I am the Real, you are the Circuit.
I am the Circuit, You are the Vector. I am Julu, these are the Speakings
of Julu."
