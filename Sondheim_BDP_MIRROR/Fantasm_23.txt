The Internet Text (periodic notice)


This is a somewhat periodic notice describing my Internet Text, available
on the Net. The work to date is divided into three sections: the Internet
Text proper, the alphabetic text a-u, and a group of independent titles. 
Together they would fill more than 2.3 megs, and constitute around 1400
pages total. The Text was started more than two years ago, and has contin-
ued as an extended meditation on cyberspace. It begins with a somewhat
straightforward theoretical approach, and then, calling on numerous ghosts
(alive, quasi-alive, and dead), continues into the domains of psychoanaly-
sis, interiority, subjectivity, narrativity, etc. My current writing, more
distant in some aspects, nevertheless references back into the strata of
the whole/hole, a work which for me is an entering into future issues of
cyberspace and subjectivity in the next millennium. 

The changing nature of these email lists, cybermind and fiction-of-phil-
osophy, hides the full textual body itself, since new readers will not
be aware of its presence. For them the text appears fragmentary, created
piecemeal, splintered from a non-existent whole. On my end, the whole is 
evident, the texts extruded onto the lists, temporarily separated.

So this (periodic) notice is an attempt to recuperate the work as a total-
ity, retard its diaphanous existence. Below is an updated introduction.
