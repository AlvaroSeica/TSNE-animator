implementation of (infinite) abacus


balls in grooves & if you slant the rock they roll dependent
   on the tilt and depth of cut so they do not fall out,
   so they are there or not there
anyone can tell they are there or not there
bring the balls back, lower the tilt
so they lower the tilt, the balls remain
let ones move from groove to groove
later on it will remain for all time: let ones remain from groove
   to groove
count or capitulate balls
later on, the grooves worn, balls flailing against all accountancy
we must move the tallying
later on, museums of grooves, a few remaining balls, weakened, witness,
   positionless
lift the grooves from the surface of the rock, breaths of different
   exhalations furrowing the air
creatures scurrying around the elder place of tallying
office lamps, illuminations, you can hear the clacking of the balls
   even on the lower floors
