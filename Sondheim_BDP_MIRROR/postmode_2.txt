A split among _postmodernisms_ themselves into _apartment postmodernism_
characterized by wealth, personal telecom terminals, and a mobile urban-
ism; and a _postmodern poor_ characterized by nomadicisms, urban inten-
sifications, information economies (de Soto), available tech/telecom
strategies, and_electric media_ (loudspeaker, telephone, telegraph).

The development of _postmodern geographies_ which include nomadic and
telecom geographies (electromagnetic spectrum for example), body/gender
territories, and noise culture domains.

The development of telecommunications as a _third space_ beyond the
_second space_ of time and the _first space_ of traditional geographies.

Appearance of the _postmodern body,_ part-object, cyborgian, simulacra
appearing as _transgressive logics_ across and within its surfaces, the
new frontier corrupted by violent social/environmental decay (appearance
of immune deficiency and other diseases, increased medical technologies,
disappearance of the dead (Gulf "War," etc.).

Entrepreneurship within the digital realm, realm of the body - the sub-
tending of the real.
