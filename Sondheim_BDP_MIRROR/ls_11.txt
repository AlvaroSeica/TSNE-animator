Han Shan (110, Pines) and Nikuko


Look at him there. You can stick him with a pin. His eyes are turned
inward. You can stick him with a pin.
  Look at her there. She hasn't moved for hours. She just sits and sits.  
  You can almost hear her breathing.
Look at them there. They're not do anything at all. You know they're
showing off.
  He thinks he's dharma-perfect. He thinks his hands are perfect. He 
  thinks his legs are perfect. He sits straight and perfect.
She sits straight and perfect. She thinks her robe is perfect. You can
stick her with a pin.
  You can stick them with a pin. They're so dumb they don't know anything.
  They're so stiff they're really dumb.
Look at the things over there. You can stick them with a pin. They won't 
move at all. You can't pull them over. They're really dumb.
