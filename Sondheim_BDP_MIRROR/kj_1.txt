Subject: letter from jennifer on anticipation

to all of you, on these dear lists,

sometimes you know when you send a text or post out that you will get a
long reply. 

and then when you send out the text or post, you wait for the reply, know-
ing you will have labor to do. 

you will have labor to do, replying to the replies, carefully tending each
one, attempting to answer fairly, holding back, standing aside to one or
another position. 

you know when you are placing yourself within the skein of interference of
or on the list, when you are touching a particular point which raises is-
sues of sorrow, exhilaration, governance, subterfuge, sex or anger. 

you are marking yourself as if you have a pierced skin, the piercing mark-
ing where you have chosen to work yourself or present yourself as worked,
or the piercing chosen to allow the work of others or a presentation to
others.

you are setting yourself in a position for an emotional trajectory, much
as a disturbance of a web inaugurates the spider. 

these are moments of anticipation that are accountable in the interval be-
tween sending and receiving, or between the initiation of the writing and
the sending, or between the thinking and the initiation of the writing.

these are moments when you weight things in the balance, decide that you
will in fact write and send such a text or post, that you will take on the
burden or duty or delight of replying, that there is a space or interval
for this, in terms of time, space, and emotional distance. 

every text or post perhaps has this element of beseeching and a contract
of future labor, and i will write no further on this, sweetly tending your
reply,

jennifer
