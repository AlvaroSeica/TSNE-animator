@examine me

Sotatsu (#2) is owned by Sotatsu (#2).
Aliases:  Sotatsu

Sotatsu is awake and looks alert.

Sotatsu owning Sotatsu is a god. Sotatsu is God. But there are not enough
arms and legs. But there are not enough fingers and toes. Sotatsu wants to
do everything all the time. Sotatsu wants to understand everything all at
once. Sotatsu Peers at his Tendrils.

Because I am God and can Extend Tendrils
I don't understand that.
Because there is room for me to grow Arms
I don't understand that.
