"The Violence of Insomnia: An Unworkable Life"

Violated Debris of Fragmented Memories and Haunts

Full Regrets and the Violins Screaming for an Unlived Life

Fabrics of Collapsed Ghosts Gnawing Down the Bones

Snatches of Conversations and Darkened Unsaid Replies

Suicide Constantly on the Mind and Visions of Death

Fear of Pain Increasing as the Months Go By

Desperate Pleas for Further Loss of Consciousness

Images of Smashed Relatives and Friends Crashed Out

Physical Contortions of Body Lashed to Terror

The Wrapped Throat Suffocating and the Neck Constricted

Headache and Fever Making their Uneasy Way towards Dawn

Dream Swatches of Torture and Limbs Torn from Sockets

Scrolling Text always Unreadable of One's True Memories

Leaving the Bed and Wakening always deeply Dysfunctional

Praying and Begging for Death and Escape from Horrid Life

Screaming to Jennifer-Julu and Other Psychotic Remnants

I Beg You! Kill Me! Put Me Out Of Misery!
