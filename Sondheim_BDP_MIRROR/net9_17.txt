1 The disestablishment of the slope at 0 in the equation:



                        y = k sin tan (x+90) . 



Clearly 2k is the height of the construction. The cross at 0 is simul- 

taneously between quadrant I/III and II/IV although its slope asympto- 

tically approaches the vertical. Is the line x = 0 devoured by the left 

and right? Where are the sets open; where are they closed? How does this 

play out in the calculus of infinitesimals?



2 Who determines the position of the origin such that the cross occurs

at 0? Is this the locus, even now, of Weyl's ego, the upper-left-hand

of Peirce's sheet of assertion where current english conventionally

begins? Should k in fact be such that 2k = 1 or 2, the aesthetics of

normalization?



3 Where is tan 90? Is it necessary to postulate the infinite? Does the

Euclidean plane return upon itself? Is this the shadow of projectivity?



4 The range of the calculator or computer graphs becomes critical here;

as the range narrows, the _raster_ increasingly appears, mapping irregu-

larities on both sides of x = 0. Measure becomes interstitial and unlike

fractal programs, the abyss uneasily asserts itself. _There are gaps in

the machinery._



5 What falls through the bag is _everything_ since language can never

foreclose sufficiently upon itself, within or beyond the molecular 

domain. Scanning-electron microscopy constructs a false implication of

sight _all the way down,_ but sight increasingly becomes algorithmic,

external, foreclosed itself as an hysteric territorialization within 

which _anything_ can occur in the form of _any_ representation. One re-

members the atoms for example spelling out IBM on "neutral" substrate: 

the transnational meets the limits of the material world. Nanotechnology 

too operates on the assumption that broken atomic machinery is non-pollu-

ting and contained; asbestos' potential relation to cancer makes one 

think otherwise. The debris of the world simultaneously upscales _and_ 

down-scales; existence wobbles as language drops out of or beyond the 

communicative domain.



6 It is within this circumscription that Winograd's and Flores' work 

becomes anxiously meaningful: "_Nothing exists except through language._"

They go on to say "We must be careful in our understanding. We are not

advocating a linguistic solipsism that denies our embedding in a world

outside of our speaking. What is crucial is the nature of 'existing.' In

saying that some 'thing' exists (or that it has some property), we have

brought it into a domain of articulated objects and qualities that exists

in language and through the structure of language, constrained by our

potential for action in the world." (Understanding Computers and Cogni-

tion.)



7 In this regard one might say that the "it" of 6 remains ontologically

indeterminate _until_ circumscription, that "it" has been let out of the

bag, and that this (ultimately Heideggerian) release defines a _languag-

ing within languaging,_ or the potential, even within a closed domain,

for the construal of relative slope which appears, within the admittedly

microscopic, increasingly irregular, wobbly, indeterminate, and inter-

stitial. Such, I would argue, which is the "it" of this domain, are 

those questions of identity and ontology raised within the pipelining of

computer mediated communication, questions which _have no answer,_ or

rather answers (as actants, confluences of specific texts, archiving of

daily, weekly, or monthly flux) which _have no questions._



8 The questions occur in a realm of language foreclosed by an ontologi-

cal-hysteric (in both the theatrical (Ludlum) and philosophical sense)

occasioned by excessive _ruptures_ between traditional domains (material,

alphabetic, psychological, mathematical), and as such the questions are

_false occurrences_ (which need not and do not occasion any _truth_ or

definition of truth). Thus the _my_ of _my identity_ occurs on a slope

among quadrants, sextants, decants... within and without a relation to

the possessive. So that the answers wobble (the chaoticity of threads)

and questions wobble; so that the answers _appear_ as simulacra at best

within the subject-headers, but the questions _appear_ in their _disap-

pearance_ as questions.



9 It is not that the _wrong_ questions are asked; it is the natural his-

tory or political economy of the _interrogative_ itself is at work, a

work defeated. Consider an enlargement of the 2k line through 0, a 

veering line at best or dubious enlargment; this is the extent to which 

the interrogative can be ascertained. 



10 And to conclude, it would be easy to say therefore that the _bag_ 

does not exist, but clearly communication _occurs,_ and so it is simply

the _nature of the bag in an always-already ruptured domain_ that 

creates the problems.
