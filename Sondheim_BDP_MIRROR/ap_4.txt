Older


An Older Mind bewails nations. It hovers dark, interconnected at nodes,
sprayed in star-configurations connected across night-twinkling-stars, in-
candescent bulbs streaked with blue at magnification 150 just across town.
An Older Mind would bend deep in Thought, would stir dark waters into dark
and stillborn Action. An Older Mind would enumerate Nations gaunt and
hoary, branches of trees rustling the sky stormed into carbon-russet dark-
ness. Lightning is sky-crack, cragged break of black porcelain, Older Mind
Sim-Symbolic illumination burned into seven-layered blood-stained retinal 
booking down to bedrock flaked with muscovite. 

Older Mind is t = 0, is <=refresh> constant, emission into screen-object, 
sound-object. Older Mind turns at t0 pace, haunted as body heaves thrust 
onto side; it ponders for No-Reason, is None. None hurtles downward into 
No-Reason; only nations say split, no capital. _Look elsewhere than you 
look._ Older Mind shudders sky-bowl swollen, crusted with Sim-Symbolic. 
Bewail.
