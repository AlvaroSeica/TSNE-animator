NOW THERE ARE GREAT RAINS AND GREAT FLOODS SAYS NEW CLAR COME UPON
THE EARTH AND THERE ARE STRONG WINDS AND THE NAME OF THE LORD IN 
FIRE SHALL BOIL THE WATERS AND THERE SHALL BE VAST DESERTS AND
INUNDATIONS. NOW SAID OLD CLAR THERE SHALL BE RAINS UPON THE DESERTS
AND THERE SHALL BE FRUITIONS AND THE PLEASURES OF MAN AND OF WOMAN.
AND THERE SHALL BE MULTIPLICATIONS AND DIVISIONS AND LATER THERE
SHALL BE EXPONENTS AND ALL AREAS SHALL BE AT RISK WITH THE DIVINE
WRATH OF OLD CLAR AND NEW CLAR, THUS WE HAVE SPOKEN, HEAR YE HEAR YE.

THE MIDDLE OF THE STREAMING OF OLD CLAR

NOW IS THE TIME TO MAKE PLANS FOR POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANT FLOODING AND
STRONG WINDS. CHECK EMERGENCY SUPPLIES SUCH AS FLASH LIGHTS AND
RADIOS. LAWN FURNITURE AND OTHER LOOSE OUTDOOR ITEMS SHOULD BE PUT
AWAY OR TIED DOWN. ANYONE LIVING NEAR AREAS THAT TYPICAL FLOOD WITH
A HEAVY RAINFALL SHOULD CONSIDER MOVING VALUABLES TO HIGHER LEVELS
OF YOUR HOUSE. EXAMPLES OF AREAS AT RISK WOULD INCLUDE LOW LYING OR
POOR DRAINAGE AREAS...OR SMALL STREAMS THAT TYPICALLY FLOOD QUICKLY.

DRINKING THE STREAMING OF THE NEW CLAR

NOW IS THE TIME TO BATHE IN THE BAPTISM OF THE LORD. NOW IS THE TIME
TO SPEAK IN THE STRONG WINDS, CLAR SAYS, TO PREPARE FOR THE RAPTURE
EMERGENCY. NOW IS THE TIME TO REMOVE THE FURNITURE, TO STAND FULL IN
THE EYES OF THE LORD, OLD CLAR SAYS, AND THERE ARE NO VALUABLES, NEW
CLAR SAYS, IN THE EYES OF THE LORD, BUT YOUR SOUL AND ITS AREAS OF
RICK, SAYS AND ADDS OLD CLAR: THERE ARE POOR DRAINAGE AREAS AS THE
MOUTH LOSES ITS ABILITY TO SPEAK, COTTON-MOUTH! COTTON-MOUTH, AND THE
TONGUE IS TIED IN THE KNOTS OF THE INFIDEL IN THE EYES AND MOUTHS AND
TONGUES OF THE LORD OUR LORD OUR GOD! NEW CLAR SAYS NEW STREAMS FLOOD
QUICKLY AND OLD CLAR ADDS OLD STREAMS FLOOD QUICKER WHEN DIRT THERE
IS AWASH, COTTON-MOUTH! COTTON-MOUTH!

SINGING DREAMING MILKY DRAINING FLUIDS, CLAR & CLAR DO SAY
We had to drill a hole in the ceiling to let the hurricane water drain
from the roof, blood!

down, let the hurricane water drain into buckets and tubs, bile!
