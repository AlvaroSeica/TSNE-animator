The Eternal Philosophy


"He would say, if not me for myself, who is for myself? And when I am for 
myself, what am I? And if not now, when?" (Hillel, in Pirke Avot.)

"THE GREATEST EXPERIENCE

"I should first have liked to be other people in order to know what I was
not. Then I understood that I had already been the others and this was
easy. My greatest experience would be to be the other of the others: and 
the other of the others was I." (Clarice Lispector, The Foreign Legion.)
