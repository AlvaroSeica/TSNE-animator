One falls into it: the text, the river, the Everglades, the alligator-maw.
It's productive, a kind of tacit/muscular intelligence at work, an
approach silencing language, in the guise of increasing (incipient)
structure. Gaining knowledge, gaining footholds, listening.

No one speaking but myself, enunciated, as if from/of the park (as if/from
the position, say, of a woman), but it is a fictivity, an approach itself,
introjection/projection.

Scales have neither beginning nor ending, pointsets and bandwidth; one
begins somewhere, after all. But the beginning is always occluded - always
this differance as you say, a deferring, not to the sign, but to its
absence - an absence spelled out only in the metapsychology of the
subject. ...

-Is it reductive to say that some of the texts you've produced operate
-across these kinds of formal structures, in which reading 'for plot'
-operates across this reading of the map of topographical/topological
-shifts, as it were? The metaphor strains, but it leads to an interesting
-situation of reading, in which 'formal' difficulties in reading apply
-pressure to a kind of tacit knowledge, "silencing language" -- arguably
-the situation of every reading, but 'more so' in this case; riskier --
-...

One might have a narratology without a reading, I think; the phenomenology 
of approach implies the former to the extent that there is a noticing, 
tending towards the intention to investigate, or at least approach - to 
reorient the mind and body towards (  ) - no matter how suffused (  ) is 
or appears to be. Even walking or a walk-around is a narration. 

One might consider an inordinately rough terrain - and then what happens? 
One's attention is consumed with keeping one's balance - almost nothing 
else is occurring, and any other goals or destinations - the teleology 
itself - may be put on hold, subsumed, reduced to a (default) tag in the 
subject's fuzzy scheme of things...

-Agreed -- but I wonder also if the psychoanalytic models -- projection
-etc --- might also be too reductive of what one might call the ecology of
-ideas, both in your texts and in the reading of them? As if the site were
-not that of fantasy or the ego but something that radically takes apart
-the ego, but 'speaks' nonetheless....

I don't think of the site 'taking apart' or 'speaking' - no such book of 
nature, etc. It's inert, real. Projection can be a diffusion or emission; 
certainly what's occurring in the phenomenology of approach is occurring 
within the subject, within the horizon of the subject - elsewhere, extern- 
ally, there's instrumental reason, etc. So I'm thinking of a broader meta- 
psychology, one of flows/flux/spew/emission as well (my notion of 'defuge' 
is related to this). As far as 'taking apart,' it's not as if the ego were 
assembled. In almost everything one does, it's absent (see Drew Leder); in 
a sense, neither it (nor id) nor the body are present -

-And here the psychoanalytic -- at least the Lacanian -- is compelling --
-what is being addressed, what is addressing the subject in or in relation
-to the site (these sentences are difficult to write -- qualification on
-qualification)? The place itself fluctuates with stains, the screen....
[...]

Again, is the subject ever addressed? In the addressing of the subject, 
surely it's always the subject that's addressing, at least in the receiv- 
ing, if nothing else? A dead subject can never be addressed, at least in 
terms of interiority and horizon. The receptor is address.

I wrote a while ago about 'sm's - using sado-masochisms as a crude model 
for couplings and linkages, out of which worlding occurs. One might think 
of couplings and linkages in terms of the phenomenology of approach and 
the skein, embedding, distancing, etc. But that would be another text...
