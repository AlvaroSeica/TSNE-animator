SECRETS





The space is filled with corners, replies coming in from the dark, 

animals beneath the bed, dolls whose eyes turn in, turn inward, follow 

us throughout the wires; each space opens onto others, decreasing or

increasing in size (there is no size) - cobwebs containing memories of

those who passed through one or another domain. Secrecy pervades the 

Net, anonymous Finland penetrating one list after another, the _azure_

of name or domain blurred at the edges, the comprehension of the 

imminent. And darkness awaits the illuminations of the Delete command

as well; working towards the machine, half-asleep, I stumble to cleanse 

it, open an atmosphere of inconceivable events. What are devices here, 

but their secret names, poured over again and again, those SED and AWK

blurring one or another distinction?



Now consider this: the roots or tendrils of the symbolic domain, 

descending through one or more levels of protocol, until the hiss of 

the transistor itself is audible - a heated and continuous debate,

meaningless except for the programming above, symbolic confluences in

furious array. And ascension or the crown of the symbol, an equivalence:

the murmur of discourse, whisper of that self-same debate, collapsed 

into the relative coolness of the lower regions of the air. The computer

itself becomes a heat-engine or pipe, a smokestack cooling meaning by

proliferating it. What rises, intensifies, only to dissipate - and only 

momentarily - is the lateral activity of the human user discernible, a

brief transformation of the neurological, the sound of the voice in the

room, dying upon the immediacy of birth.



Secrets attach themselves among the levels, glimmers of recognition;

at night, silent addresses label each other, claw greedily. In the 

EXIT mode, there is no EXIT, and the user waits with an increase of

anticipation - who could be calling her at this hour? The margins

of the screen fill with the symbolic order which, as I mentioned,

pretends a momentary visitation and nothing more forthcoming. The

margins on occasion extend further, as well - wrapped beyond the 

frame of vision, syllables, whole sentences, are cut off, never to

return, or else to be reconstituted one after another after another.



Does not all of this occur in silence? Words speak through me and

I resonate with my voice as among no other; my voice is my silent

speech of the keyboard. Anticipation reverts to response and further

hooking of the reader and the writer, a merging of identities and

constructs.



Neither neurosis nor psychosis, secrets are the backbone of the Net,

the communication which lures and lures intensely. It is not the

evidence of the screen, with its cross-gendering and anonymity, that

characterizes the user - it is lurking, rejection, negation, and the

deposition of the secret beyond recall. What is given is only a 

vestige of an enormous web or sememe; what is given is a residue of

the problematic flesh and mind hinged on the edge of the terminal.

Lurking is ground-state of reception, even when the computer is

off, terminal disconnected, with the user himself in the embrace of

uneasy death.

PROPOSAL FOR FRANKLIN FURNACE, AN ALTERNATIVE ARTSPACE, ACCORDING TO 



THE INTERNATIONAL SINGLE FLAG SIGNALS FOR SHIPS ON THE HIGH SEAS >>>









"We may produce an exhibition of ideas for Franklin Furnace's sea

change in the Fall of 1994." (Martha Wilson, Founder and Director)





`A. I am undertaking a speed trial.' Technology is moving the post-

industrial world fast-forward through information bottlenecks at every

node. The artworld as usual lags behind. It is necessary to break

through the conception of the gallery as a SITE and reinvent it as a

NODE both mobile and physical. It funnels the stationary planet into

the WEB INVERSION, the topological reversal of the body into wires and

fibre optic cables.



`B. I am taking in or discharging explosives.' In order to avoid the

exhaustion of art itself, art becomes packets of information; as flow,

art becomes what it has not been, a focus of multicultural change and

examination of the problematic. Instead of the artwork, consider the

art wave-packet, an emission dissipating as soon as it is launched.



`C. Yes.' There is a way to construct this. Consider a gallery

consisting of a room with several computer terminals. The main one

will be permanently locked onto a Mosaic hypertext containing

emissions from Franklin Furnace - anything, including text, sound, and

image, that can be transmitted. During the day, Mosaic will run for

gallery-goers; the image will be projected through an LCD display

coupled to an overhead projector - standard corporate technology. 

At night, the terminal becomes a World-Wide-Web accessible site with

a URL, containing the same information for distribution. This terminal

is on a dedicated $250/month SLIP connection and runs 24 hours. A

second terminal is a daytime W3 site for outgoing, with different

information. A third terminal is used to connect to various other

gallery sites, and a fourth is set to Read Only for several list

conferences and Usenet groups concerned with cultural matters. All 

computers are set to download to a Laserjet printer for 10 cents a

page (text only). The gallery will function as a moderated list

itself, sending out transmissions from artists to selected Net sites.

Staff will be on hand to assist and run through program protocols.



`D. Keep clear of me - I am manoeuvering with difficulty.' At first

there will be bugs in the system, ranging from access time to typical

moderating decisions. Eventually it should be possible to utilize

macros to simplify commands; a storage capability on the Mosaic

machinery of two gigabytes will hold a reasonable content. Animated

images may have to be downloaded after a short period of time.



`E. I am altering my course to Starboard.' A high circulation or

overturn will result in a continuous community development, almost a

MUD (multi-user-domain) morphing through art works and media.



`F. I am disabled. Communicate with me.' One of the virtues of

traditional art is its quality of the obdurate - the necessary

recognition of the material of the work itself, its inertness. Unlike

most Net communication, the gallery will continue this tradition by

insisting on signatured works, retrospectives, targeted audience

demographies, and email access to the artist herself. Works concerned

with gender, multiculturalism, and the troubling aspects of cyberspace

will be favored - works questioning the so-called Information Super-

highway. Within the world of electronic subjectivity, we are all

disabled, on the verge of the reconstitution of the body itself.



`G. I require a Pilot.' I require a sysadmin to lead me through

cyberspace so that I may face myself, reconstitute myself, suture the

damaged life. 



`H. I have a Pilot on board.' But I become my own sysadmin, beyond

technical support; I am my own imaginary. As an artist, I deal with

the uncanny, the resonance of recognizing the uncomfortable aspects of

existence and its everyday ontology. On the Net, I am object and

subject; I abjure these distinctions.



`I. I am altering my course to Port.' My course is chosen as a

dialectic between wind and intention; as a node, Franklin Furnace

increases its information flow exponentially, reaching viewers on an

immediate and world-wide basis.



`J. I am going to send a message by Semaphore.' In order to send a

message or create a work, I observe the necessary protocol. I enter

the address domain of Franklin Furnace; recognized by users, I format

my work as a Net-flux. Through the terminal the user views the

universe itself; Franklin Furnace becomes a transitive term, an inter-

connectivity, both transparent and obdurate.



`K. You should stop your vessel instantly.' The obdurate is present as

a transmitted recognition. To stop is a radical act; the Furnace

exhibitions stop one in his tracks, temporary terminal lockdown. It is

precisely within the Net that the mandate of Franklin Furnace is

realized - it is within the Net that the (multi) cultural politics of

the future is played out.



`L. You should stop. I have something important to communicate.' Art,

like people, "passes" on the Net; a certain insistence may accompany

the importance of a message, even with Kill and Delete files. What is

ultimately communicated through Franklin Furnace is the CHATTERING of

the multicultural realm, the CONCRETE problems of history and

historiography in a setting of cultural politics and political

economy. The Furnace is in a unique position to transmit the concrete

as no other gallery.



`M. I have a doctor on board.' Art has no message and no cures; to

presume otherwise is the pretension of art. On the Net, one doctor

meets another; what always emerges is dialogue, the possibility of

language and images becoming transformative. On the Net, anyone can

respond to an artist; personal style carries very little.



`N. No.' And anyone can say no to anything. In a traditional gallery,

the artist and artwork are subject to review; on the Net, they are

subject to negation, to a dialogue constituted by rejection, displace-

ment, and a consideration of the work by the viewer which rarely

happens in a physical space. The terminal is the introjection/

projection of intimacy; the viewer responds at her leisure.



`O. Man Overboard.' What is lost is the body of the phallocratic as

flesh sinks into the sea; within the digital domain, reproduction is

exact and eternal, repetition without end or signal deterioration. As

with all dissipative emissions, works fade away into noise as they

remain only in human memory or hardcopy, eventually removed from

storage. But within the digital domain, they are perfect or perfecting

- each copy identical with the original, ontologically equivalent as

well.



`P. _In Harbor_ (Blue Peter). All persons are to repair on board as

the vessel is about to proceed to sea. (Hoisted at the _Foremast_

head.) _At sea_ - Your lights are out, or burning badly.' Because of

the feed-forward speed of cyberculture, it is necessary that Franklin

Furnace act quickly to secure its continued existence on the

"frontier" of culture. In order to do this, it must simultaneously

prepare to go on-line, and dissolve its existing structure. Although

the Net is timeless, there is no time to lose.



`Q. My vessel is healthy and I request free pratique.' With a minimum

of effort, the transformation of the gallery will increase its viewer-

ship by several thousand-fold. Unlike many of the on-line sites

already in existence, the Furnace will create a _practice_ as well as

a mobile exhibition-space. This will consist of: 



  An emphasis on multi-cultural considerations; 

  The blurring of the artwork itself by an aura of discussion; 

  The resulting transformation of the work into a _discursivity_; 

  The creation of a continuous dialogue surrounding both the work and  

  its ostensible position or subject-matter; 

  And the development of a liberatory transformative potential through

education, the uploading and downloading of files, and extensive

follow-through for any exhibited materials.



`R. The way is off my ship; you may feel your way past me.'

Paradoxically, although the new Furnace is more open to view than any

public work of art, it does not possess the somewhat problematic and

manipulative aspect of public art - that the public _must_ view it,

like it or not. Instead, one may ignore the gallery altogether - or

enter it at one's risk. Because of the potential circulation to

50,000,000 viewers, the gallery would nevertheless be guaranteed a

larger audience than any physical gallery now in existence.



`S. My engines are going full speed astern.' The gallery will be open

to continuous monitoring, back-tracking, and change. Some of the

changes will include potential expansions into the following areas:



  Low-power television and radio stations.

  Public-access television programs.

  Special-events accessed by remote monitors tapping into the SLIP

account lines.

  Direct hookups to on-line chat-lines with the possibility of

establishing a chat-line concerned with art and multiculturalisms.

  Establishment of a data-base of artists available on-line, replacing

the traditional slide-files.

  Creation of on-line artists books and a date-base of relevant

(physical) books from the past.

  Education in electronic access run through the physical premises of

the gallery.

  "Screenings" for live audiences within the premises, using Mosaic

and pre-arranged material and artists/users on-line elsewhere.

  Far down the road: Potential for exploration of virtual reality in

transmitted form; potential for establishing a MUD based on arts-

related issues (there may already be such).



`T. Do not pass ahead of me.' In order to implement all of this,

Franklin Furnace would have to immediately tap into the on-line

services and arts forums already available, such as Anima. It is my

experience that cooperation would easy and productive.



`U. You are standing into danger.' The downside of all of this -

rejection of the idea of an electronic nexus - is that traditional art

is becoming increasingly irrelevant - NOT because of its power, but

because of its dwindling audience and highly-specific demographics.

With the Net, the endless arguments about regionalism versus centrism,

for example, disappear: EVERYWHERE IS EVERYWHERE ELSE. The Net

combines the ability to influence and create policy with a rough

grass-roots politics; there is nothing else like it.



`V. I require assistance.' Grants should be forthcoming from a number

of organizations desiring to test their hardware and software; artists

tend to use new equipment in new ways. There is tremendous generosity

in the on-line world; a lot of bulletin-boards, for example, are free,

and run as hobbies. Technical assistance is readily available as well

through various Usenet groups and list conferences.



`W. I require medical assistance.' Now things are getting serious.

Franklin Furnace has been both visible and constructive in the current

censorship crisis, and there are signs that commercial servers are

already censoring incoming Net material. This is a highly active arena

for freedom-of-speech issues, highly relevant to the Furnace

tradition.  



`X. Stop carrying out your intentions and watch for my signals.' I am

always open to giving advice, while remaining in a state of complete

powerlessness...



`Y. I am carrying mails.' From beginning to end, the complete trans-

formation of the gallery should take six to eight months; beginning

Internet communications should occur within six weeks.



`Z. To be used to address or call Shore Stations.' To begin, the

gallery needs to hook up with either a commercial server or a

university system. The former are often Unix, but have inexpensive

SLIP accounts; the latter have varying degrees of access. A

collaborative effort with a computer department is in order...





The above signals transform the gallery into a communications network

combining both easy through-put and obdurate material. As such, the

gallery can expect to remain relevant to the society at large, since

it would no longer be bound to a specific form of physicality, but

would commit itself, instead, to transform according to the protocols

of the age...
