.echo
by Alan Sondheim
Alan Sondheim's new ebook, .echo, takes you on a fascinating journey with 
Nikuko Meat-Girl into the language of avatars, transliterate lovemaking 
and virtual subjectivity. While interacting with Sondheim's ebook of 
mystical eroticism, the reader will lose themselves in a net.fiction 
charged with sex, obsession, codework and real bodies pushed to the limit. 
A provocative theory-world presented in the guise of experimental 
narrative, .echo takes the reader on a high-speed, yet zen-like trip 
through a hallucinatory landscape that one can imagine used to be the 
world. There's never been anything like this book as it confounds the 
relationship between America and Japan, prosthetics and aesthetics, 
visible words and invisible intelligences. Enter at your own risk!

The Wayward
Salt Books
The Wayward is an exploration into virtual life and theory. It uses tools 
from codework to traditional genre; much of its work is the result of 
programming intended to create systems of circulating texts. Think of The 
Wayward as a poetics of the imaginary, stumbling over the grounds of the 
real - constantly questioning linguistic referents and 'meaning in 
general.' The work is a ground-breaking exploration of the roots and 
structures of online and offline life, in which language simultaneously 
explodes and implodes. Conversations among 'emanents' dominate 
inconceivable landscapes; sexualities are constructed and deconstructed. 
There's not another work like it.
