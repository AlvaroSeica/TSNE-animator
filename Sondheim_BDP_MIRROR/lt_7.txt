visitation


Azure sat up in bed in the middle of the night eyes wide open, with an 
unrecognizable expression on her face. She was looking around. Where is
the third one she said. I don't know who you mean I answered. The third
one she replied, where is the third person. I said there wasn't any. I 
don't know the gender. She turned over and fell asleep, her expression 
as usual. I had been reading the Chu ci, songs of the south, again. I'm 
sure she saw Nikuko hovering over her.

ikons for the modern world; and they shall sit well with you while i
swallow you whole; my work is an enormous gullet, pierre, that devours
everything in its path. of all people, you should know that, especially
after the affair with mme. n----. it is one thing to eat what remains of
children; it is enough to devour the effluvia of young women shuddering at
their approaching death. i would we all go to the rack, but then who would
man the guillotine. someday we shall be guilty of capital offense; in the
meantime i would bring you a fresh young thing, full of fourteen years,
with a bosom well beyond her years. remember our metonymy; this is the
ripe fullness of the world and its symbolic. a breast stands for the hole;
the hole for the hole; my mouth filled with flesh for those who scream
with hatred at our existence. we shall devour them, the young women in
particular, their cunts remaining barren of future revolutionaries. is
this not the future of the world. their children shall not reach us alive;
their swords not cut our throats, their muskets silenced by their mothers'
deaths. ikons for the modern world indeed. we shall march on, pierre.
come, i have new blood to show you, virginal and ripe for the plucking.
metaphor is deadly; let the body be herself, let herself be ours for the
several hours left of her pathetic life. "ikons of the modern world," M. 
Freschet.
