I can't get away from this; I lose sleep, shudder nightly, nightmare, 

scroll follows me during the day, my life is damned, reduced to language, 

my god I've got a brain hands arms swaying into empty air, my life's a 

mockery.



O poor stage all I do is complain to you my lovely computer screen. I'm 

fucking fifteen years old without a future! I can't do anything with my 

life! I can't understand them!



I'll never live to twenty-five and my best friend said I deserved to be 

dead and I think everyone agrees with her that it would be the best thing 

for everyone.



I'll pretend to be anyone! I promise I will! I'll do anything, get me off 

this machine, bring me a friend walking through the door with smiles on 

her face and we'll fuck and live forever I promise, she'll never leave me 

because I'll be so good to her, wait and see.

my mind is drowning that's cold before i go

down discomfort before i go

that's the words melting the water into moths

control-T moths

moths

my cock is cracked earth dust got it by the window

mouth got dust got something caked blood red

the color of flame the color of water, earth, and blood

there's no air here reflection shows me air

shows me air earth and empty flames

reflection shows me flames
