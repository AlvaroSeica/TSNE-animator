magnets , acting at a distance
with invisible force you can put your hand through , nothing touches it
  or moves it , and it's an everyday occurrence
you can feel what force _is_ while gravity is just what surrounds us
  pulling us into shape rather than asunder
i'd focus on magnetism as that which corrupts the essential nature
  of _things_
similar to contagion , disease whose vectors appear in the night and
  unassimilated
unsimilar to contagion , in that there are no effects at a distance , 
  nor by increasing proximity , only substance stopped by substance ,
  by virtue of the mass itself
unsimilar as well in a unary effect , coupled with electromagnetics ;
  contagion , on the other hand , may appear on the hand , the foot,
  the mouth; it carries the _flawed ,_ purveys _damage ,_ constructs
  _fear ,_ they say so
the magnetic constructs nothing , or else novelty ,
by virtue of this lack , it constructs _virtuality_
which is , and here is the chiasm of the matter , a _saying_
which says nothing at all

( just as magnetism says nothing at all , uses or no uses ,
  jennifer says , knowing saying is magnetism , knowing magnets 
  sayable )
