dusk, 2013

it is this day:

thunders, chasms, fluids
there is fighting in the hills
you proceed increasingly sodden, bogged down by body organs
you eat corpses
sometimes you wander into spaces and return as doors close
 permanently behind you
you are bewildered, none of your own are here
looking down you see torn nipples, you sense you're withering
it says it is dusk again
