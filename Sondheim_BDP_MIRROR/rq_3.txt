Dance description (for the empyre email list, highly edited here)

I've been following this discussion and thought the best way I might 
participate is to describe the work that I've done with Foofwa d'Imobilite 
and others over the past decade or so. We went from using video and audio 
tracks accompanying choreography, to work in Blender and Poser. The Poser 
work was created from bvh (Bio-Vision Hierarchy) files produced with 
motion capture (mocap) equipment that used 21 sensors electromagnetically 
interacting with an antenna. The antenna fed sensor signals into a hard- 
wired 486 microprocessor that output coordinates; these were fed into a 
second computer that created the bvh files themselves. we modified the 
sensors in a number of ways - some through the software interface, and 
some with limb assignment and position. We did a piece called heap for 
example - the sensors were dropped in a heap and the bvh file fed into 
Poser. We did a star piece, arranging the sensors in a star formation on 
the floor and inverting it by exchanging +r from a sensor position to -r. 
We also reassigned sensors in several ways - dividing them between two 
bodies, remapping inversely onto a single body, and so forth. All of this 
produced bvh/Poser mannequins that were used as projections in live per- 
formance, or chroma-keyed over dance/performance video.

All of this work was at West Virginia University's Virtual Environments 
Lab, headed by Frances van Scoy. I received an NSF consultancy through 
Sandy Baldwin and NYSCA grant; through the former, I had a grad assistant 
from software engineering, Gary Manes, to assist me. We went into the 
mocap software itself and Gary rewrote it, creating a dynamic/behavioral 
filter interface, which would produce transforms from the sensor output - 
before the 3-d assignment to bvh was made. This was modeled on graphic 
software filtering, but the assignments were different - we applied a 
function f(x) to the coordinates and/or modified the coordinate mechanism 
or input streams themselves. The bvh files that were produced were sent 
into Poser for editing; in some cases, Poser mannequin video was output. 
But more and more, we edited in Poser to format the bvh for upload to 
Second Life; this way we had live 3-d performance based on the transforms. 
This performance could interact within Second Life itself - with other 
online performers and audience - or through projection, without Second 
Life, in real-space where performers might interact with the avatars.

The bvh files are complex and avatars perform, most often at high-speed, 
with sudden jumps and motions that involve them intersecting with them- 
selves. The motions appeared convulsive and sometimes sexualized. Foofwa 
d'Imobilite used projections direct from Poser - about 100 files - as part 
of Incidences, a piece produced in Geneva and widely shown. Foofwa, along 
with Maud Liardon and my partner, Azure Carter, also imitated avatar move- 
ment - and this fed back, from dance/performance into programming and pro- 
cessing; at times it has been impossible to tell whether a particular 
motion stream originated on- or off-line.

In SL, everything is pure, digital, protocol, numeric; by 'smearing' the 
animation input, avatar appearance, and location, we create in-world and 
out-world experiences that stray from body and tend towards choratic and 
pre-linguistic drives. We've performed a lot at various limits of SL - on 
sim edges for example, or at 4k 'up', where the physics changes. The 
output is the usual - audience in-world or out-world, as well as video and 
stills. 

Foofwa, Maud, Azure, and myself all traveled to the Alps where avatar work 
was re-enacted live; the performances were on the edge of the Aletsch 
glacier. (This was sponsored by a Swiss grant.) What was interesting most 
to me here was the development and performance of a field - Foofwa dancing 
with a VLF (very low frequency) radio antenna, for example - his body 
coupled and modified the electromagnetic capacitance surrounding the wire. 
We had done this indoors with Foofwa and Azure; outdoors, against the 
glacier, spherics formed a deep part of the content. This also paralleled 
work we did with the mocap sensors at WVU - using high-strength magnetics, 
we modified the local fieldlines, almost as if we were modeling general 
relativity's 4-space gravity/mass interaction - the results were similar. 
I'm fascinated by these 'cosmologies in the small'; at the same time, want 
to avoid any easy and false metaphoric equivalence with scientific theory. 
As for the theory of the work we're doing, at least from a phenomenologi- 
cal viewpoint, I've put up http://www.alansondheim.org/sltheory.txt which 
has also been published as a book.

At the moment I'm working with sim overload and self-reflexivity: on a 
simple and neat level, what if a performing avatar connects to an object 
('prim' complex) designed to move away from hir? The result is a total 
[avatar/complex] that flees indefinitely - at least until the complex goes 
out of world.

Death Cull

The new reality is watching, walking death, repeatedly, until 
things finally come to an end. Everyone goes through the same; 
we are always the new old. Every week there are new 
disappearances; because I have so many acquaintances, I see 
these disasters constantly. Why disasters? Because, unlike 
everything else in life, there is an obdurate finality about 
death; communication, palliatives, reminiscences, are no longer 
possible. Death points to the impossibility of life. Death 
points by virtue of non-pointing; there are no vectors in and 
among death. Death is neither singular nor plural. My friends 
and acquaintances disappear; my daughter and I are estranged: 
mutual disappearance. It began when I was a child; whole 
generations died off. By the time I could think through them, 
they were gone; by the time I could think, death gnawed me. Life 
is a process of sinking through life and lives. The new reality 
is always present; what's new is the constant birthing of death. 
Death is assigned names: X died, whole sets {x} pass on, 
veterans, generations, species. Death begins with _death-of_; it 
is the last use of the name, which undergoes absorption. Another 
way to think: the proper name contains the seed of death. 
Another way to think of it: death is a time or demarcation for 
the living. But this is not death, this is the signifier. The 
signifier of death is not, can never be, death. Death for the 
living is a gathering of similarities. The proper name changes 
when death enters; it no longer serves as the reception or 
transmission of messages in the name of the body. Or rather 
there is an ontological shift in the body, which enters the 
virtual in its entirety; someone may speak in the guise or 
simulacrum of the body. Death transforms the speaking body into 
an other speaking-for. What was unspeakable, the body, is the 
responsibility of others; the speaking body, even before death, 
lives within a recessive mode, every utterance a portal unto 
death, every utterance a gift on the verge of being returned. 
How does one approach this, one's death, the death of others? 
One only waits; being is waiting, and being alive is living 
awaiting. As one ages, one awaits time itself, the real is 
transformed into the passive substance of dying, rebirth and 
rebearing elsewhere beyond a horizon, immovable, unnamed. We 
remember the partings of others far more than their arrivals; we 
remember the arrivals of deaths, more than the parting of 
others. We passively take our place in this panoply; there is 
never anything more to do, never anything more that has been 
done.

Alan Sondheim pens Writing Under: Selection from "The Internet Text"

MORGANTOWN, W.Va. -- The Center for Literary Computing and West Virginia 
University Press are pleased to announce the publication of _Writing 
Under: Selections From the Internet Text_ by Alan Sondheim. This 
extraordinary collection of work explores and examines what happens to 
writing as it takes place on and through the networked computer.

Sondheim began experimenting with artistic and philosophical writing using 
computers in the early 1970s. Since 1994, he has explored the 
possibilities of writing on the Internet, whether using blogs, web pages, 
e-mails, virtual worlds, or other tools. The sum total of Sondheim.s 
writing online is entitled "The Internet Text."

_Writing Under_ selects from this work to provide insight into how writing 
takes place today and into the unique practices of a writer. The 
selections range from philosophical musings, to technical explorations of 
writing practice, to poetic meditations on the writer online. This work 
expands our understanding of writing today and charts a path for writing.s 
future.

John Cayley of Brown University proclaims Alan Sondheim to be "the poet, 
the artist, the maker who has most profoundly immersed himself and his 
work in the life-changing code formsof networked computation that have 
the world and its 'genesis redux' in their grip." Christopher T. 
Funkhouser of New Jersey Institute of Technology affirms that "anyone 
interested in knowing more about (or from) a writer who has practiced and 
thrived on the Internet since its very beginnings needs to read this 
book." (See below for more.)

Alan Sondheim is a Brooklyn-based new media artist, musician, writer, and 
performer. He is concerned with issues of virtuality, and the stake that 
the real world has in the virtual.

_Writing Under_ is published by the Center for Literary Computing, West 
Virginia University. To order this title or to learn more about this book

"Alan Sondheim is one of the precious few who joyfully-and in abject 
misery-risks these terrors of writing for us, for our pleasure and our 
undoing. What happens? Language disposes of us. As if that were not all 
that is required of any writer, Alan Sondheim is also the poet, the 
artist, the maker who has most profoundly immersed himself and his work in 
the life-changing code-forms of networked computation that have the world 
and its 'genesis redux' in their grip."

- John Cayley, Literary Arts, Brown University

"Sondheim crafts an often meandering + always introspective recording of 
his prodigious on-line output. Birthed [and often remixed] in digital 
formats and drenched in anxiousness + desire, his staggeringly open text 
gives rise to possibilities of endless interpretation and comprehension, 
leaving multiple re-reads a definite must."

- Mez Breeze, Australian-based writer and practitioner of net.art

"Encountering Alan Sondheim's work we become aware how versatile a writer 
he is. The vast fore-lands of his Internet Text contains an estimated 
25,000 pages of wryting involving - as Sandy Baldwin observes in his 
introduction "a phenomenology thick with human perception and intentions 
that are bodily, personal, political, and communal." In wryting, Sondheim 
produces all sorts of texts - poetry, prose, and the unnameable 
compositions existing amidst conditions of material transformations that 
merge (with) the physical and technological. Writing Under offers up 
generous statements of process, from a self- and other- aware master who 
is codework's godcyborg, a limner of psychedelic landscapes in Second 
Life, and an inveterate graphophile. This volume radiates foresight, 
stabilizing, if only for a moment, the fragility of "tenuously tethered 
bits and bytes" that exist in a vast field. For Sondheim, the creative is 
critical and vice versa; there's much telling in _Writing Under,_ 
projecting insight into the machinery of his oeuvre. Anyone interested in 
knowing more about (or from) a writer who has practiced and thrived on the 
Internet since its very beginnings needs to read this book."
