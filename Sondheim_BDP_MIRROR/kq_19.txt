Finding myself


giving a talk, outlined internally, there are always sections that allow
me to riff until the next subject comes up - they're tied together like a
skein, not one thing above another or vice versa - all over the place - so
that it becomes a relief, I can even think, go into remote, if I know
somewhat of a particular subject - this or that - and can think ahead to
the next topic - having to be careful I keep my personal life out of the
thought - away from all of it - so that I don't get sidetracked, find
myself forgetting what I was saying, moving elsewhere, returning to cer-
tain sites I know will produce reaction, holding them in abeyance, re-
leasing them _in such and such a manner,_ controlling the slip stream _in
other words._ so that the ruptures, flows, allusions, signs and signs,
appear as if on the demand of the audience, rather than the therapeutic of
the construction of the speaker. which is the construct of the speaker,
the constitution of the speaker. in  and of the speaker. speaker. her.
and over and over again, desperate for the woman, to be the woman, to
speak.
