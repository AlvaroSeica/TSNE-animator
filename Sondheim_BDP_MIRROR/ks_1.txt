Some Thinking of s/ms during this period my Sicknesse (very primitive
stuff here)


Linkage abc s.t. a -> a' --> a'b'c'

Coupling abc s.t. a -> a' --> a'bc

In both abc = bca  
        (ab)c = a(bc)
        aa = a

Spray a[Zn](t) where Z is a bandwidth indexed by n ranging from 0 to the
       order of the continuum, and (t) is a temporal indexing.

Collapse [Zn]a(t)

Chaos-Mother a[Zn], [Zn]a

Avatar-Binding [Zn][Ym] where n,m are at least inaccessibly high.

Mirroring [Zn][Ym](t) --> [(ZuY)f(n,m)](t) where f(n,m) >> n v m

Mirroring [Zn][Zn](t) --> [Zf(n,n)](t)

Desiccation abc -> ab v bc v ac v a v b v c v

Rill  -> a

Some thinking here, paralleling thinking years ago through graph-marker
theory in which networks were mapped according to states or nodes; these
mappings could fold in upon themselves, mirror, or absorb foreign elements
with or without basic transformations.
