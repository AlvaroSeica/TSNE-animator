It has occurred to me, that, while there are a number of ways to directly
express laughter in ordinary English words, there are none to express
tears and crying, beyond those of mourning (i.e. the 'lalala' of ulula-
tion, or 'waawa' of wailing). Where are their _sounds,_ why this silence
over human misery, which then is read centrifugally, described at best? 
As if only mourning were worthy of representaton...

Laughter itself _thuds_ in pure sound, 'haha,' collapsed in breathy heav- 
ings.
