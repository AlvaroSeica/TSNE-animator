Tsunami





I am writing you in the midst of the onslaught of logouts, cancellations, 

packet-debris spewing haphazardly across the screen, storms of commands 

untended; I am writing you against all odds, quickly, before the knock on 

the door, before the final silencing. 



This is a message whose purpose is a slice breaking ground and protocol, 

holding the self-same door apart/in departure from itself, from the frame.



It is the door bolted from the frame.



It is never a moment of truth, but a moment of the implementation of 

power: leverage.



The screen closes like a low horizon, close to the ground; ordered 

lightning constructs the text, clears. It is a forgotten ground: nothing. 

A farewell always obsequious.



But I am writing you in the hope of the text, the hope of speech, breath 

forced into the play of symbols. But I am writing you in the midst of the 

onslaught of logouts, cancellations, the debris of the symbolic, every- 

thing you might make of this.
