AFTER-WARDS





sometimes i write like a child with tension just beneath the surface

i will write complexly simultaneously defending and revealing the face

sometimes i save each and every keystroke and return them as text

sometimes i check the content of my text for spelling

i will automate myself on irc and look at the mirrors of everyone else

sometimes i check for diction and statistics of styles

once in a while i will set all caps or small letters

i will use a program called julu to help me when i'm at a loss

i will use programs with the display function to fill things out

sometimes i will rake my older texts with grep looking for lines

sometimes i will use sed for complex and continuous substitutions

once in a while i will build upon layers of substitutions

once in a while i will use programs such as hangman for content

sometimes i will use eliza for psychoanalytical interaction

once in a while i will use my own derivative for sexual psychoanalytics

every so often i will use old computer-card reproduction programs

the text-based game adventure lends itself towards performativity analysis

i will enter talkers alone or with avatars for metaphysical studies

i will use the review command or archie or gopher for archaeologies

i will build simple objects in moos confusing object numbers and names

sometimes i will use ytalk for reproduction of body image in textual form

html and dhtml give me the opportunity for text and image based html-body

javascript lures and seduces the viewer into psycho-liminal content

images present the edges of things as if they were interiors

i will use qbasic programs to examine the contours of measuring

i will use gimp or photoshop to reveal the internal tissues of the world

i will use shell scripts to reorganize texts into new revelations of shame

i will speak through programs begging for questions and answers

i will play textual games if they reveal whatever is left of truth

i will reprogram a mud to reveal the mad interiors of speech and phenomena

sometimes i will create disturbances on email lists or newsgroups



sometimes i see my face embedded in the face of the other; it is like a

plaque or medallion embedded in the face of the other or like a cartouche

bringing to mind discrepancies; it is like an emulsion half-developed or

it is like the breakdown of any conceivable methodologies; or like a decay

or dissolution of applications and results; a disturbance which refuses to

resolve; a constant reminder; the forgetting of a name passing in the form

of a body; something else, i can barely remember, on the tip of my tongue,

something of lips
