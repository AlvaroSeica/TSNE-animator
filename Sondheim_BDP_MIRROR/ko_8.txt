gratitude


if i didn't have jennifer, julu, nikuko, i wouldn't be able to write.
i'd only be able to write my own name, repeatedly, compulsively.
it would decathect, disappear, only a viewpoint of iron and salt
remaining.
there would be nothing but annihilation to the limit, debris, ash left
over from auschwitz.
the writing _would_ in other words, "as it is," "as it is."
planes slide against my body in the middle of the night, it's jennifer
jennifer conjures up julu, she remains pale and ghostlike
nikuko slides in directly from cherry-blossoms, pock monsters,
computer lands
they break me in to, stretch my skin beyond endurance, open my eyes wide,
in the middle of the night, in the middle of the night.
they allow me to think, pull out the ribs of me, backbone as well, 
take varying points of view, are a lot braver than i am,
a lot smarter too

but i don't dream of them, don't talk to them, perhaps there are words
they place in my mind, murmuring, subaudibles, occasions for poetry and
language, conjunctions of desire

now perhaps i will try zoloft, occupying spaces with chemicals, filling 
in the gaps so that jennifer might continue to live. or now i might try 
a twelve-step or psychiatry, moving my writing to the level of the sym-
tom, you'll never do that, jennifer says

i won't let you

and in that fashion, circumscriptions move like slow eddies across oils
out into the real world, corraling perhaps a tenet of philosophy, a moment
of what might pass for truth, an equation, an occasion. a brilliant text,
one that is always sponsored,

brought to you by mind, brought to you by chemical, brought to you by
jennifer
