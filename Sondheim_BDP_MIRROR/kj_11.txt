[A final and important point: the use of the word "avatar." This implies
too great a distance between creator and created, as well as an ontology
of the thing-created, as in the command @create $thing called "Alan" on
the MOO. I prefer to think of all of these, Jennifer, Alan, Julu, Nikuko,
as sites, domains, emanations, emissions, which are necessarily interwoven
and which share coagulated ego/s, matrices. A different language is nece-
ssary for constitutions, including that of the _presentation of the self
in everyday life,_ so close and so constructed.
