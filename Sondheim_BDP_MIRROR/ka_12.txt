Yours


You take my eyes.
You take my eyes and they are gone forever; I cannot see limb or lineage.
I allow you to do this.
You take my eyes and place my fingers against your face.
I feel your eyes, mouth, lips. I place my fingers in your mouth.
I hear you when you speak to me; I hear you when it speaks.
My fingers trace your lips; I promise you everything, body, world, tongue.
It begs for your mouth; you place it within you; you are very
quiet.
My fingers caress the outlines of your hair, your neck, your speech.
My fingers hear you.
What my fingers hear is the sight of eternity.
It is perfect and everywhere I look there are lips.
You give me back my eyes.
Everywhere, lips.
Everywhere, I see lips.
