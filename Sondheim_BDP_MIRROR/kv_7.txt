iii and final existence meshine


existence meshine gets derailed to relive and relieve the history of agri-
culture as we begin to plant and breed across the world, how much we grew
up loving and reading on farming and Pony and Cow. now you will see how
planting gave loving and reading on living way to meat and flesh animals,
and how these animals took over from existence meshine busy creating and
loving someone reading stories and texts and whatever else might be placed
in the very first row creating consciousness with the prefabrication of a
past. with the invention of a past. with no past at all. with just-being-
past. with no past at all. call this iii and final existence meshine and
you will see how the world works now and how it has always worked but we
only know that now, how it works, and how it works by derailment.

the end of existence meshine.
