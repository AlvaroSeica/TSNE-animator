survive. the woman mutilated herself by eating pieces of her fingers.

fragments of cocks, breasts, cunts, churn through past-histories as

mutilated hate crimes, digital eternities mutilated by legacy softwares

and dead prisons, mutilated translations of the usual, the holds and holes

of the body; leaning in toward the screen; the mutilated screen,

projection of emptied spaces, mutilated sites, questions of the mutilated

history of every little thing



mutilated women, men, children. even the order's got an ideology, informal

hate crimes, digital eternities mutilated by legacy softwares and dead

dull and mutilated violence against oneself, the accumulation of mutilated

signs. 



destroyed and mutilated. - you are killing children. your scatter-mines,

your leaflets are destroyed and mutilated - you are killing children,

killing everything. everything is destroyed and mutilated. what damage

mutilated, returned, sliding out forever, caressed, cuddled, fucked,

mutilated, returned, sliding out of view of a mutilated conversation. 



the mutilated faces were unrecognizable.



# the signs were unrecognizable. the machine sorted, resorted, arranged.

# the signs written by smiling old men. 

# the signs were brought on the backs of the wounded.

# the foiled assassination. the concentration camp. the computer-roundup.

# everything in this world is evil, she said.

# the smiling old men in power pissing oil.

# the world can't hold us, they said.

# we are far from damaged life, she said. we are mutilated.

# there was no answer. believe in this: meltdown of the net.

# there was no answer. believe in this: you can see the world teeter, if 

you look around and leave the commentary.
