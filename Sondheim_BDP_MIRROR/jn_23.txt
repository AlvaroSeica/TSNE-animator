at his thought, notion of freedom, noise, jazz, politics, sexuality. Think
of fucking him. Someday it clears.

Jennifer wants to stop hiding behind Jennifer. Alan is sick of the whole
thing; everything turns -J. He'd turn it off in turn, but an odd turn,
he's in love with her. It's Valentine's day and they hug and hug and hug,
turning over and over again. It is a relationship of pure delight and
mutual sharing and compassion. Alan feels that Jennifer is under his skin
and she feels that Alan is under hers. They refuse to listen to noise of
codependency; things could never be so perfect. Sometimes they cry out of
pure happiness. Alan wants to stop hiding behind Alan. Jennifer is sick of
the whole "Jennifer-Alan" thing but she is very much in love. Jennifer
loves the smell of Alan's panties and Alan loves the smell of Jennifer's.
Sometimes they play in puddles or just role around giggling. No one has
ever heard such happy giggling in Brooklyn loft before. No one has, bring-
ing a smile to Alan's and Jennifer's faces. People see them and are also
so happy. They say that Alan and Jennifer are just the very way for happi-
ness. Jennifer and Alan smile and laugh, they are so very much in love.
