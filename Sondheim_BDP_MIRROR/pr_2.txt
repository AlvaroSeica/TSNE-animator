J'aime si tendrement le desert et la mer;
Que je ris dans les deuils et pleure dans les fetes,
Et trouve un gout suave au vin le plus amer;
Que je prends tres souvent les faits pour des mensonges
Et que, les yeux au ciel, je tombe dans des trous.

I love most tenderly the desert and the sea;
I find a curious suavity in bitter wine,
I smile at the saddest moments, I weep amid gaiety;
I take facts for illusions - and often as not, with eyes
Fixed confidently on heaven, I fall into holes.

(from Baudelaire, La Voix in Les Fleurs, trans. George Dillon)

MEDIA+SPACE New Media Gallery :: Yonsei University :: Seoul, Korea ::

Alan Sondheim :: Avatar of Excess
An exhibition of video work and texts.

Exhibition: Wed June 11  Fri June 20th
Artist will be present via Second Life at the
opening Wed. June 11th 1pm



condensed S Korea online SL performance text
with Sandy Baldwin and Baruch Gottlieb

Alan Sondheim is a unique figure in contemporary cyber culture. A 
hyper-prolific artist, poet, and critic, Sondheim produces dozens of new 
works every week and publishes these in a variety of venues from 
conferences to galleries to Second Life to the numerous mailing lists he 
inhabits.

His online persona and his work are utterly symbiotic; his language 
straddles the edge of coherence between the machine language of code and 
the global lingua franca.  English is unique in that it is used by 100% of 
the computers of the world as well as by a significant section of human 
society. Sometimes it is hard to tell if Sondheim's work is created by a 
human or by an automaton.

Alan Sondheim's use of language in his oeuvre exemplifies the 
infrastructural actuality of English today.  Often repetitive, railing 
away on a tangent, riddled with codes and surging with automatic energies, 
Sondheim evokes the perverse vitality of the proto-cyborg consciousness of 
our age and it's obscene hyperproduction.

Human forms appear as avatars in Sondheim's videos only to be corrupted, 
smashed and smeared by irrepressible surges of information, rendering 
palpable the fragility of human meaning in the age of self-perpetuating 
automatic processes, the masochistic ecstasies of the human body at the 
mercy of it's machines. - Baruch Gottlieb

fragment

I am the originator of Ron Silliman, which happened
The day before I originated poetry. In this manner, 
I originated Patrick Herron, who, through a sad mispelling,
Flew from the birds which I originated just the day before.
Hello Patrick, I say, as he flies overhead, on the way to flarf
And other lines that start with Larger Letters.
All letters are capital! He cries, every single one of them!
How am I to argue even if G makes me quake, an ornate C
That cuts curious the cataract from my left and fuzzy I.
On a dark and otherwise murderous night, Maria Demon
Completed her work and I emerged, speechless, holding her
Responsible for every word I write; please contact her 
If there are any difficulties with this transmisson. At what
Bleak point did Socrates trade Daemon in, suturing her name
Which used to be Sally Forth? I know he meant no harm,
He was busy writing me into submission while I, knowing the worst,
Created Silliman, Flarf, Cataract, Damon, Herrons Galore,
And at least two letters of the alphabet, now sung
Almost as much as any other (jst dd vwls!).

sound from an unknown 1980s small keyboard with 2-key polyphony

i had to fix the keyboard today and

it's our seventh wedding anniversary today
and if it weren't for azure and her kindness against all odds
i'd probably not be alive
sometimes there are gifts out of nowhere and undeserved
our wedding was one of them
poor azure!
but i'm very happy, personally



4 experimental works that look and sound, i think, beautiful?


the following amazes me; altered bodies were coupled by root transform- 
ations, bvh files were displaced 2.5 seconds, and the rest was automated.

{sexual proximity is differently calculated than among organisms; sheave- 
skin operates at a distance and coupling follows Bell's work on QM.}

the following is an earlier hi-speed experiment along the same lines; in 
this one behavior collisions dominate and obstruct.

{constant repair did nothing to the ruin which is photographed from two 
different positions, male and female.}

{lightning without the whistlers, recorded at 96 hz, notch filtered and 
graphic equalization in cool-edit}
