ANIMALS


(Cybermind receives comp1.jpg, comp4.jpg; Fop-l applies imagination to the
ultraviolet realm. Comp1: I stare out from my laptop screen; the index of
narcissism collapses like a deflated tube; there's only me, how ridicu-
lous. Comp4: An inverted gopher appears in the Astor Place subway station,
transformed by the World Wide Web, dark and tiled animal damning the rest-
lessness of the imaginary. It's as if comp1 kissed comp4: CAN YOU UNDER-
STAND THIS? Who's tunneling through whom? Whose tubes collapsed, whose
still-births?   Eh, it's all dark anyway, hardly any space to move. I went
home to Brooklyn but not before taking a SNAP, morph-morph me-me.)
