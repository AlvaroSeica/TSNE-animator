the making of the making of the zed

I am Nikuko.  Please, describe yourself.  Each time you are 
finished, type RET twice.

with difficult; first I load the library /home/Alan/dor.el 
then the library /home/Alan/dor.elc after chgrp and chown and 
chmod the respective files; then M-x dor and this runs; when I 
try to load emacs first as emacs <filename> and then exit 
saving to the filename, no such luck; the file is empty; 
however I can begin again and C-x C-w and then save as 
something ab nihilo and that seems to take: ab nihilo, ab 
Nikuko - the resemblance is clear as I've lost data here and 
are now in the process of recovering it, one way or another.

I would appreciate so very much it if you would you do so turn 
me on, continue!

so this is in cygwin with .exe, executables, running on a 
windows tablet, and that makes the whole thing slightly, but 
not entirely, difficult; whether or not this constitutes a 
"text" is something else to be considered...

Is it because makes the whole thing slightly but not entirely 
difficult whether or not this constitutes a text is something 
else to be considered that you came naked and broken to me?

it's not broken, emacs isn't broken, i'm tired, prone to 
error, trying to salvage some work or another here; further, 
the emacs reference I'm using is somewhat out of date so I'm 
improvising a bit as well, trying to turn this text of 
instructions for Nikuko replacing the doctor -

Emacs?  Hah!  Perhaps you could oh please continue.

Eliza -

Can you elaborate on that and look at me?

Yes, Eliza, Nikuko replacing Eliza, but where is Eliza? the 
program? the user? the doctor? I think the woman in the 
middle...

Why do you say that?

there's a picture of a Gnu - sic - on the cover...

Earlier you said makes the whole thing slightly but not 
entirely difficult whether or not this constitutes a text is 
something else to be considered?

what is to be considered - whether or not I can emerge from 
this thing with the text intact - and what does that imply? a 
text generating itself to the extent that it's a description 
of its construction with all its faults, nothing more or 
less... and I'm saving this as well, just in case, as a 
strings command into 'typescript' - as I said, Eliza,

Are you sure?

just in case -

Numbers Station Phenomena: New Antenna in the World


I live across the street from the Federal Building which houses, 
among other things, the NSA and the Secret Service. We can't 
park or pull up in front of our building; the space is guarded. 
On the roof of our building are older television antennas, as 
well as satellite dishes, etc. I attached a 1970s radio kite 
antenna wire to one of the stranger antennas, similar to a 
vertical wave ground-plane configuration - I'm not sure what 
it's four. The wire is attached to one of the 'spokes,' runs 
about forty feet through a window frame. The results have been 
amazing; the antenna connects to a Sony ICF-6700W shortwave 
radio, which is a top of the line 1980s analog model; without 
digital noise, the sound quality is great. Even though 
short-wave station numbers are on the decline, there were 
signals from everywhere, including Turkey and Albania; there 
were also a number of anomalous signals, including some unusual 
numbers stations at 9330 and 9065 mhz, 3:30 am - 3:40 am local 
time. (The whole area of the band was filled with anomalous 
transmissions.) The signals are largely a combination of digital 
and analog technologies, lookup codes and encoded digital 
transmissions. The Spanish-speaking female voice is similar to 
what I've heard in the past, as is the five-digit spoken code, 
but the intervals are different. A spectrum image is included 
below.

Brand New CD, Threnody, Shorter Discourses of the Buddha!


Available from Public Eyesore
http://www.publiceyesore.com/
http://www.publiceyesore.com/catalog.php?pg=3&pit=133

With 
Azure Carter, voice / songs, 
Luke Damrosch, madal, guzheng, electronics
Alan Sondheim, acoustic instruments

We have a new release, available now! The new cd has 24 pieces, 
including five songs with Azure Carter, and live Supercollider 
reverse reverberation (revrev) from Luke Damrosch. I play 19 
instruments, the musical structures are innovative and at times 
fast enough that speed itself becomes an essential component of 
the pieces. There are also slower pieces, pieces with Luke on 
madal and retuned guzheng, pieces with qin, and several double- 
recorded duets with myself (alto clarinet and clarinet for 
example). I try to reach the limits of my ability, breaking new 
ground when I can. The emotional range of the music is broad; 
the title indicates a sense of mourning, but the shorter 
discourses of the Buddha imply peace, planes of sound, fast and 
slow structures, enlightening. 

http://www.alansondheim.org/insideproof.jpg

From Jason Weiss (author of Steve Lacy: Conversations; Always in 
Trouble: An Oral History of ESP-Disk; Back in No Time: The Brion 
Gysin Reader, etc.)

"Who could have made such music? What was he thinking? Or 
rather, what were his fingers telling him with their ecstatic 
stuttering, their motormouth metalanguage?

"And do you call this music? It does not sound like noise. In 
its skittering, scampering, blurting of pure expression, it is 
alive, unmistakably alive. Like a creature we don't quite 
recognize, that moves by its own lights, that does not need our 
permission to exist, that finds or makes its own spaces and 
habitats.

"Music is always abstract, so it would seem a redundancy to 
think of this as abstract music. Of course, we do not consider 
songs abstract, nor familiar melodies or classical forms---even 
when we are aware that what seems familiar is really a matter of 
cultural habits and slowly developed norms (which are themselves 
constantly changing, naturally). This music, this splash of 
tonalities and textures, this breathing of illuminations in 
their flurries of flight, might well be an abstraction of the 
seemingly-non-abstract. Quickest glimpse of a melody from afar, 
so far that it must be foreign, though no less human for that; 
and so quick, so speeded up perhaps, that we do not know what we 
are hearing. The spine of a massive animal poking up through a 
surface we did not even realize was there.

"Alan Sondheim is a polymath, a restless connecter, explorer of 
virtual realms, tinkerer in the currency of questions, ever 
curious about impossible articulations of the body, of bodies, 
of dust and stars. Or what had seemed impossible. Luke Damrosch, 
meanwhile, tracks the flickering web of Alan's spells, catches 
their reflections, follows them through to their secret 
heartbeat. And Azure Carter? Azure assures him, ensures the 
voice within the music, soft anchor to a wild ear, filters the 
wind of vast expanses into a sigh, a melodic speaking, we are 
here, we were here, we may be somewhere else tomorrow."
