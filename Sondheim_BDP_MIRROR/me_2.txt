 male and female (male older, heavy, awkward; female younger, lithe, 
 graceful)

theory1.jpg (closeup of male ass, genitals; it's as if the body is upside- 
down in a darkened space, straddling a pillow or armrest)
  to read, create the conditions for arousal
  the theoretical capture of the screen--
  it cuts across the borders of this image:
  it's always traveling--it's always taking
  you along
(caption on left, comfortable)

theory2.jpg (closeup of female ass, genitals; the body similarly 
positioned)
  it's addition by zero, multiplication by one--
  absorbed by your presence; it's
  multiplication by zero, addition by one--
  something changes--the text
  makes way for my body
(caption huddled against the left)

theory3.jpg (full male on stomach, shot from rear, naked, straddling a
couchback; the ass is highlighted, head receded into darkness)
  it dreams huddled when
  nothing's there--
  everything crosses
  the border
(caption close in against the body on the left)

theory4.jpg (female in similar position, skin slightly red-purple, head 
even more invisible)
  you are giving me no room--you want to cross me--it's a double-cross--
  chiasm--what is drawn repeatedly--what draws you in
(caption crosses the body on the upper part of the image; it's from margin 
to margin)

theory5.jpg (male on stomach, naked, straddling couchback, legs spread, 
head receding into darkness, invisible, abject, chiaroscuro)
  i'll follow it; it comes closer--it's almost as if--you want 
    entertainment
  --the body's weighted down with words--it's getting harder to speak--
  o heaven
(caption crosses head, neck, shoulders, on upper portion of image; it's 
heavy on the body--two long lines, then the shorter apostrophic)

theory6.jpg (female straddling couchback, naked, legs spread, abject, head 
receding into darkness, chiaroscuro (but haven't all the images from 
theory1.jpg through this one been chiaroscuro))
  are you breathing
  are you breathing
(caption on upper left)

theory7.jpg (male naked lying on top of couchback, shot from side (i.e. 
the front of the couch; the other images have been shot from one end, 
shooting up in darkness between the legs), the image almost whited out, 
as if shot through gauze (it wasn't), low contrast, the body ungainly, 
head as if caught half-open, facing downward, falling from the neck)
  light--it's all over
(caption on lower left against the white lightly embroidered sheet 
covering the couch)

theory8.jpg (female naked lying on top of couchback, shot from the same 
position as the male, the image almost whited out, low contrast, graceful 
body, head facing down, covered by hair)

she wanted to fuck a terrorist. she wanted the best orgasm in her life. 
she wanted to flirt with danger. she wanted the bomb in her hands, fuse
against her breast, flame burned, seared labia, hair on fire to the stars.
melanie was beautiful with long black hair and eyes so dark you'd see
nothing. christopher was beautiful with a perfect shock of brown hair and
eyes that looked right through you. you couldn't lie to christopher.

christopher and melanie thought the anthrax scare was nonsense.

melanie wanted to have sex with a terrorist in front of christopher.
christopher would be tied up, bound so hard the ropes cut into him.
melanie and the terrorist could watch him as they fucked. christopher and
melanie were married. christopher wanted to give melanie to the terrorist.

melanie and the terrorist would fuck and melanie would groan with the best 
orgasm in her life. they would cover each other with white powder. they 
would smear white powder in melanie's perfect long black hair, soiling it. 
the terrorist would rub the powder raw in it.

christopher would come watching the terrorist fuck his beautiful wife. he 
thought anyone could have her now and everyone was better than he was. he 
came harder than when he was inside her. sometimes the terrorist and 
melanie would fill his mouth with white powder and he would gag. they 
would shove powder into his anus. they would make his eyes blur with it.

christopher and melanie were fabulously rich and they would pay the 
terrorist. they did not know his name so i cannot tell you. he was just 
called the terrorist.

at first we had this talc, we pretended
 it was a war zone full of danger, then we got cyanide
  and other stuff around the house -
     it was the way we approached everything, we'd fuck, we'd
      cover ourselves, hope it would wash off in the long run,
	   sometimes our friend would play the terrorist, he'd grind it
	   into us, hard, we'd be burned with it,
	      sometimes we'd be really sick, it went on,
	       an incredible rush, i'm not sure what she died of,
	         something or someone may have something to do with it

		    people would watch us for a dollar or two, we'd give
		       them names like abc or cnn, they could bring
		       cameras, 
					they just had to show whatever
					they took to everyone they knew,
					  we wanted to be
					  marked, they'd see us in the
					    street,
					     want to get it on with
					     us, it was a thrill, i can't
					     tell you, sometimes we'd fuck
					     them, sometimes it was like, 
     the last thing they saw was her cunt,
           it was worth it, we got rid of nbc that way,
       cbc, cbs, the last of them, i tell you, my cock was worth nothing, 
       but her cunt, it was like a gun

           he'd grind it into us,
              sometimes we'd be really siing, we'd fuck, we'd
               something                 y the terrorist, he'd grind it
                  or someone may have som
                       cameras,

                                          in those days we wanted to be
                                          marked, they'd see us in the
                                                almost like they'd die

analysis

a repeated sort in this instance is made by sort file1 > file2 - at which 
point file2 is justified; then file2 > file1 - at which point file1 is 
justified. this repeats - not indefinitely (although i have no proof of 
this) - until stasis is achieved - i.e. file1 = file2.

the sort is alphabetic; therefore the concepts - which are similar to
kantian or aristotelian categories - are organized accordingly in
alphabetic order. this transforms the concepts - which presumably have
their own, implicit, order - into associations based on explicit happen-
stance. the result is an apparent relativization of conceptation, based on
nothing more than english (in this sense it is similar to some of the
logical paradoxes of the early 20th-century which 'resolved' in terms of
one or another language).

further, if the concepts are indeed foundational in any sense whatsoever -
then any ordering is as good as any other, since they would be intrinsic-
ally independent. the associative complexes formed by repeated sorting 
would be the result of a dialectic of perception between the reader and 
the text, which is more a collocation or inscriptive apparatus - a search 
engine in the sense of a spider, across and throughout the real and all 
its appurtenances. 

finally, a certain biologism is apparent in the list - ranging from 'i' 
and consciousness through 'self' and 'self-awareness'; this brings to 
light a certain reduction or veering of conceptation towards an organic 
reading - i.e. heuristics or methodologies for making sense of the world, 
ranging from retinal processing through naming, inscription, referent, and 
truth. this is also at variance with a classical condition of independence 
- in this case, the variance is from within the list, intrinsic to it (the 
list at this point conjuring up classical cybernetics as well), not 
extrinsic - a deeper waywardness, redolent of desire, than alphabetic 
ordering would create.

analysis^2

meta-analysis or the need for compensation, sublimation exacting an
equivalence somewhere down the line or loosely across the plane. all of
these are open moments - 'well, i'll explain myself,' 'well, i meant such
and such' - and in relation to legitimacy. see analysis^2 as a thwarted
series; the idea, that of recursion as in gnu - gnu not unix - and hack -
tends either towards the asymptotic - 'well, i don't know,' 'well, it
might have been' - or towards a foreclosure or basin - 'well, you've got
enough to go on,' 'well, you don't care anyway.' then in any case, an 
apologetics of writing, writing in an n-dimensional space, writing to 
oneself, extending the skein or membrane, trapping others -

 for seven and a half years i've typed at least one work a day, well

    there are most likely seven-hundred texts a year, five-thousand

       and collapse it, abjectly

       these are letters coming out of mouth, anus, penis, streaming

Theology

If the Supreme Triumph is enormous, one must penetrate the Loathsome
Screen to attain Perfection. But the Supreme Triumph is the width of six
furlongs and the height thereof; the skin is to the depth of six fathoms.  
If the Tree against the Imminent Fire thereof is the thickness of the
width of the Triumph, the Body Multiplicand lies on the Divan of Pearl
beyond which Women Enter only in Service and Servitude. Of Imminent Fire
it may be said that the Weakest is of Boiling Lead and the Replenishment
of Bone and Gristle, such that the Distance between the Weakest and
Strongest is of the order of a gnat's wing. For a man, a single Turning
suffices to erase past sin; for a woman, the Imminent Fire surrounds her,
from morning unto night, especially from night unto morning. Thus within
Imminent Fire her Garments will be rent from her and she will remain in
Attack of numerous demons; within Supreme Triumph, the Sufficient Man has
in Service only those boys and women of impeccable character who delight
in his Service. Of young girls and infants we say little. Of Eunuchs we
say nought at all. Thus I should rather drink of Musk than die in Torment
and I would rather eat of the Fruits of Triumph than have my flesh torn
from me; I am glad having been born a Man; I would not have borne Woman
but to serve Him, now and Thereafter.

some are quotes of absolute truth of The Supreme Triumph and the Evident 
Loss: In the light of the Quran and the Sunnah, Saeed Ali Al-Qahtani; some 
are of the Essenic Flames; some are of the Truth of Burgess; some have
found themselves among the Desert and Deserted. of Nikuko and Izanami much 
have been spoken. all bodies decay in shame; none return. of the human 
women, one need look no farther than the testaments, no closer than the 
mirror; let it be said pikaia did not survive.

don't worry for a moment, it won't hurt,

someone's lying over there,

there was nikuko. there was this girl nikuko. this is writing in the
dream-field vi with autoindent. she was in samadhi. mumonkan 42. lotus
  sutra. she was in samadhi. she was naked. her finger was in her. her
  hand was in her. her wrist was in her. her arm was in her.

  she was in samadhi. she was covered in white powder. her skin was
  burning. she was called flesh-girl meat-girl. she was a girl. manjusri
  was there. she was near the buddha-throne. she was touching the
  buddha. flames burned from her fingers. flames touched the buddha.

  manjusri was there. he asked shakyamuni, nikuko is touching you. he
  said, you are burning, burning. he asked shakyamuni, why is she touching
  you. he asked, why are you allowing this. he said, why is this in what
  law or precept. shakyamuni buddha said, bring her from samadhi, ask her.
  shakyamuni buddha said, ask her yourself, do not ask me.

    manjusri could not bring her forth. he tried towards the left and
    right. he tried in the five directions. in the six directions. he
    could not. he could not be centered. nikuko was burning, flames issued
    forth from her fingers, they touched the buddha, nikuko's arm was
    inside her, her other arm, her hand, her fingers, caressed the
    shakyamuni, caressed the shakyamuni buddha. manjusri could not do
    anything, she would not wake up, he could not arouse her, her arms
    were in the buddha.

    shakyamuni buddha said to manjusri, you can not do anything, she will
    not wake up, you cannot arouse her. shakyamuni said, there is the
    bodhisattva momyo. i will bring bodhisattva momyo. shakyamuni buddha
    brought forth bodhisattva momyo. bodhisattva momyo emerged from the
    earth. bodhisattva momyo snapped his fingers. nikuko emerged from
    samadhi, her fires decreased, her arms and hands and fingers emerged. 

      of nikuko it is said she was the consort of shakyamuni buddha, and
      her fire did not cease. of nikuko it is said, from compassion she
      created illusion, from dispassion, maya, from samadhi, nothing. of
      nikuko it is said, she created nothing, she was this girl, she
      created theater and the drama, she created buddha and the stage, she
      created parable and aphorism. of this aphorism it is said, it was
      written by shakyamuni buddha, it was written by manjusri, it was
      written by momyo. 

      she was this girl, she created shakyamuni buddha, she created
      manjusri. of this gloss it is said, it was written by momyo.

Le Popu Ballistique


My father sings the opera beautifully. There are nine acts and tableaus, 
coloratura. It is for solo voice.

in the day:

1 Untitled: prologue
  Scene by a swimming pool. A blond woman in the distance wears a bikini
  and is sunbathing. She is framed by palm trees in silhouette. There
  are beach chairs behind her.

2 Miami Vice
  A closeup of the woman. This scene is very somber. She disappears and
  blurs out.

in the night:

3 nikuko and alan were good terrorists
  The beginnings of the somber intermezzo. The scene is bathed in red-
  brown. nikuko appears nude, outside, on a second floor landing. She 
  looks wistful. There are apartments all around. She is in closeup.

4 bad people wanted nikuko's cunt even if they died
  The second of the somber intermezzo. The scene is bathed in brown-red-
  brown. nikuko continues to stare out from the second-floor landing.

5 nikuko and alan are waiting to kill you
  Bleak and darker in this third of the somber intermezzo. The scene is
  bathed in the same light as before, but the view is from a greater 
  distance. It is here at the climax of the opera that my father's voice
  reaches its greatest range in an unforgettable aria.

6 alan would offer nikuko to anyone who wanted her
  Darker yet, the fourth of the somber intermezzo. The seem is bathed in
  red-brown-red light, blood colored, somewhat mottled. nikuko is seen in
  closeup again, as in the first two scenes.

7 in miami, nikuko fucked everyone and everyone died
  From a distance, the fifth of the somber intermezzo. The light changed,
  cooler, tan. nikuko is standing upright. She is still on the landing,
  leaning slightly against the railing. She is still nude.

8 nikuko would give their corpses to alan to fuck
  The sixth of the somber intermezzo, deep blood red, darker, very 
  mottled. The same view as the previous scene. nikuko has turned
  slightly. 

9 no more nikuko and alan
  The last of the somber intermezzo, green and liquid in appearance. There
  are two empty beach-chairs, recliners. An apartment complex is behind
  them. They seem to be at the pool. An open hallway is overlit in the
  background. At this point my father's voice dies to a whisper. He sings 
  just as beautifully in a soft, low voice. 

10 Untitled: epilogue
  The blue-green-blue edge of a swimming-pool. Bubbles rise in a parabolic
  arc. This scene, the last, is in silence. The audience is quiet. 

Everything in the Le Popu Ballistique is uncanny. My father's voice, Azure
naked on the landing, the blond woman almost naked in the prologue - these
are the austere elements of this opera of muted terror and annihilation.
For the first time, trauma takes central stage. The audience leaves, 
already in memory and denial. This was happening to them.

My gun sings the war beautifully. There are nine acts and tableaus, 
coloratura. It is for solo voice.

in the day:

1 Untitled: prologue
  Scene by a swimming pool. A tank in the distance digs in
  and is sunbathing. She is framed by palm trees in silhouette. There
  are turrets behind her.

2 Kabul Vice
  A closeup of the tank. This corpse is very somber. She disappears and
  blurs out.

in the night:

3 afghanistan and usa were good terrorists
  The beginnings of the somber intermezzo. The corpse is bathed in red-
  brown. afghanistan appears nude, outside, on a second floor desert. She 
  looks wistful. There are apartments all around. She is in closeup.

4 bad people wanted afghanistan's cunt even if they died
  The second of the somber intermezzo. The corpse is bathed in brown-red-

8 afghanistan would give their corpses to usa to fuck
  The sixth of the somber intermezzo, deep blood red, darker, very 
  mottled. The same view as the previous corpse. afghanistan has turned
  slightly. 

9 no more afghanistan and usa
  The last of the somber intermezzo, green and liquid in appearance. There
  are two empty battlefields, trenches. An apartment complex is behind
  them. They seem to be at the pool. An open hallway is overlit in the
  background. At this point my gun's voice dies to a whisper. He sings

on the movement from cdrom directories to videotape
on the movement from computer to television
on the movement from session to venue
of your willing participation as historiographer
of your willing participation as viewer

killing off my videos. they're slewed together, collapsed/wounded from the
desire of the directory, conflation promulgating choice, confusion,
repetition: i'm here in the midst of images - you're there held taut by a
timeline binding you to constancy. what unfolds for you, never unfolded;
unfolding is for the spectacle. combination accrues on combination -
sixteen short works combined into one, two large at the beginning, five
larger at the end: for me, the order is irrelevant, but linearity is 
necessary for completion/projection - for the viewer, the order creates 
signifiers arraigned in taut transitivity; the diegetic continues across 
the invisible razor cuts; the viewer's in a train wreck of blown meaning. 
for the venue: open one track/open them all. on the cdrom: the tracks 
disseminate; they're partial; they lean against one another; they lean 
against the same; they resonate; they remain incomplete; pornography and 
desire create loops and projections on the order of f(g(x))=x; everything 
circulates towards the elimination of processes; everything is capable of 
returning; the body can do anything it has already done; it can do 
anything at any speed; it lends itself to you; it is among domains; it 
unfolds for you; it unfolds repeatedly; it's there for you; it's a dream- 
screen capable of infinite dissemination. in the venue: f(g(x))=0; every- 
thing disappears; everything is memory; you are bound to this assignation 
in a foreign hotel, foreign affair; nothing continues forever; the product 
production is always already gone; you're embedded in an economics of 
project projection; you're never there; you're at a loss; it's this kind 
of loss. of sharing or communality, none. of the order, discrete and well- 
presented with loss, with this kind of loss, as the translation is made, 
from computer to video, from video to television, from television to the 
televisual. it goes there. it's transformed into art. it's a sheaf among 
others. it's the harvest of shame.

"do you know how to speak with a human voice. do you know how to breathe 
without breathing. for they live beneath the waters and they drink of the 
sky; for they burrow in the earth and elsewhere move at will invisible 
through the air. for they are of the voice a u m. if you don't know this, 
it makes no difference. you may have made this world, and you may not have

Visitations


doctor i get these fevers constantly; i'm under tremendous stress. i've
taken my art as far as i can - i'm not even sure it's art anymore. sexual
nakedness repeats itself into infinity; my recent presentations carry the
repetition as i*i*i traveling back and forth across the imaginary. there's
no end to it. i don't sleep well. i'm shaky. my vision produces peripheral
illusions. there are headaches, chills. i take codeine. i take coffee. i
produce.

i say this because of sleeplessness. i'm always on the verge of breakdown.
i want all the bodies in the world bought and sold. i want the sex and the
guns. i want the sweetness and collections of late-night promises. i want
tender farewells and corpses.

there are no other reasons. beneath the skin, there's skin. flesh cuts
into flesh, organ into organ. two cells occupy the same space. they love
it.

there's room for everyone. nothing but the chills which i have to great
degree. they don't disappear. at night i twist until my body becomes
someone else. that person fucks and dies. that persons buys and sells,
this is all contract. live within my means.

i came broken to you because there's no choice. nothing comes and nothing
goes. i see brutal mountains. no vegetation. i want the bodies there. to
come to me. bought and sold. there's room for everything in the desert.
they have visions in the desert. i want the visions.

yes.

i've ceased crying long ago. others cry for me. they see for me. i am an
other. i am written for. i am naked, fucking. they provide me. i die. they
die. it makes a seal, contract. i endure. i come to you.

some woman. some man. sometimes the same.

collapse of day. the fever is furious. i do nothing less than this. i
create the conditions. i collapse them. the hunger continues. you are too
cold.

mountains and night. live within the other's means. i collapse them.

go through, doctor. don't ask. don't tell. i won't say a word.


I don't understand and oh I want to.

Rape of 'tat' - tv anthrax-terror


this is your show doctor. i'm here for the ride.

Is it because you wanted to see my reactions you wanted to see me naked
you wanted to see what I have to say that you came naked and broken to me?

Does it bother you that you wanted to fuck me you dream of me all the time
I have the power?

i love it. it doesn't bother me at all. fuck me and kill me. in the middle
of abc. in the middle of cbs. i don't care. i want you. in the middle of
the air. in the middle of nbc.

Earlier you said you wanted to see my reactions you wanted to see me naked
you wanted to see what I have to say?

Oh oh I do see so...  Well, what makes you yearn and cry that this is so?

Maybe and now I adjust my panties - your desires have to do with some girl
related to this.

there's no girl. you're the girl. in the middle of fox. i want you to fuck
me. in the middle of the air. in the middle of cnn. i want you in me. i
want you to kill me.

This is a healthy and so true way of thinking. What makes you believe it's
true there's no other way to think? When did you first know that you want
me to fuck you you want me to say this I am the girl you want me in you
you want me to kill you? In the middle of fox air. In the middle of cnn.
Are you afraid of sex? Why not? You mentioned that you wanted to fuck me
you dream of me all the time I have the power?

Oh oh yes, ahhh...  Are you sure that this is so? Tell me about something
about your sexual history. I would appreciate so very much it if you would
expose yourself about your sex life and body... Discuss your feelings
about your sexual partner. Tell me more and more about your most intense
sexual experience.

Have you been satisfied with your partner... ? Is it because of your life
that you are going through all this? Have you been frightened by sex?
Elaborate on more about your sexual history. Perhaps you could oh please
describe your sex life and body...

it came from the moment of the explosion. in the middle of the air i swal-
low radio. in the middle of the air i swallow television. screams. i knew
from the abc rape the nbc rape the cbs rape. i knew from the fox rape the
cnn rape. i knew.

Tell me about your apprehensions toward your sexual partner. Expose your-
self about your most neurotically stimulating sexual experience. Are you
satisfied with your partner... ? Have you been scared of sex? Discuss how
you feel about your sexual history. Please, tell me more and more about
your sex life and body...

Elaborate on your thoughts on your sexual partner. Describe your most
exciting sexual experience. Have you been satisfied with your partner... ?
Are you aroused by sex? Tell me about something about your sexual history.

it came from the moment of the explosion. in the middle of the air i swal-
low radio. in the middle of the air i swallow television. screams. i knew
from the abc rape the nbc rape the cbs rape. i knew from the fox rape the
cnn rape. i knew.

of falling


tonight azure and i watched the leonids. i don't sleep anyway; i woke her
and we went out, lay back on the deckchairs by the pool and stared up
between the palmtrees. huge clouds floated by from the east then north.  
you could see around them. we saw meteors. we were alone. they had been
moving through space since the early solar system. we witnessed hundreds
burning up in high atmosphere, some leaving bright and glowing clouds. we
watched. we cowered. i said, i think you're the only reason i'm alive. i
was thinking of azure, of my father, my daughter. i didn't feel there were
others. i felt i have done enough. i felt this world is emptying out.

for azure, i should have remained silent. these things can't be discussed,
they're present, they breathe down our necks, caress our face. they're
silent. and then there's judgment.

of which, nothing. there's no judgment for good or evil, there are fits
within laws made by humans scarcely in agreement, humans who can barely
think for themselves, who live shuttling between fear and desire. what
doesn't fit loses; what fits, goes quiet.

after death, nothing. all about the judgment is senseless. draw that
senseless down to you. bring it to life in the world. it remains the same
and just that, without meaning except they will take you away for what
they don't want or don't like. there is little more to go on, derrida
notwithstanding. jurisprudence works out the fine points, drags ethics
along, which is where ethics belongs. but not in this world; ethics is not
of this world, not of us. the tether always breaks. we built ourselves
against and within that. life turns into an impossibility by virtue of
culture drawn out along legalisms and the rapture of implicit violence. be
on the side of the winner. be a scapegoat. walk silent.

the meteors are drawn nowhere; they have a indescribable ontology. i think
of all those billions-of-years-old topographies on the way to annihila-
tion. it is never possible to recover lost terrain, only the memory of a
tiny shooting star moving south from here, almost overhead, a punctum i
will retain and retain.

i have seen meteors. i have seen meteors leaving clouds glowing in the sky
for minutes afterwards. i have seen fireballs and portents. i have seen
omens and comets, rare atmospheric phenomena, bead lightning and aurora.  
azure, i said, almost crying, i wanted to hold that back, you're the only
reason i'm alive. the shifting of pillars of the world was terrifying;  
nothing happened; no judgment was called. i did it myself, turned against
me; i made sure i lost. the meteors continued; they are falling now.
