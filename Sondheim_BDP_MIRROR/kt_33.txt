Burning, Mary, Clothing


Mary, Mary
Forth, I will call you
The land is wounded
Omens in the sky
The omens have burned
The sky has disappeared
Mary, Mary
Doves hurtle towards you
Omens surround you
The omens are torn
Your vestments are torn
The sky lost its name
Your name is Mary
Cloth disappears
Then there is skin
Your skin is on fire
Perfect blue flames
Mary, Mary
Your nerves are on fire
Your fingers on fire
Fire, your mind
Fire, your vestments
Mary, Mary
Like an arrow you come
Through buried omens
Through slaughtered sky
Corpses of doves
Remnants of cloth
You remember your name
I remember the telling
We'll come together
I'll do the telling
You'll speak your name
The telling your vestment
What a woman you are
What a story I'll tell
'Your clothes are all gone
My skin is blue fire
Your hair is all gone
We're perfect together
I see through your eyes
Fire, my eyes
There's no air to breathe
There's nothing to eat
Drink from my flesh
The omens are burned
The omens are buried
We're now on our own
You'll make an arrow
I'll be your bow
My nerves are your bowstring
My mouths are your arrows
My cocks are your shafts
My words are your poisons
You'll send me flying
Through dead doves and omens
You'll send me flying
Through air burned with names
Through omen-burned air
My clothes are all gone
Through omen-lost flight
I'll be your telling
I'll be your omen
I'll be your dove
I'll never come down
I'll never falter
Fly higher and higher
You're smaller and smaller
A mole on my breast
A glint on my teeth
I'll take you with me
We'll scatter new omens
Ready for wounding
We'll scatter new names
Ready for burning
You'll burn in my breast
You'll devour my skin
You'll flay me alive
You'll write with the Runes
The Runes are my skin
A Name! A Name!
The omens are wounded
The sky has disappeared'
