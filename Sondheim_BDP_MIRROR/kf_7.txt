The Stillness of Frozen Flesh


There on ThePalace or WorldsChat there is the silent, immobilized ava-
tar, the image which refuses speech, perhaps whispering or paging else-
where, the avatar who _sits_ in the midst of others conversing, the
silent listener at the party. I imagine a future in which he or she,
naked, turns slightly, imperceptibly, at the mention of a name, twitch
of an eye - a pornography based on the _revelation of planes._

View [x] -> View [x+1] & in the Midst of Silence, this thin Layer as
_Supplement_ in Replacement of that Second in the Turn of _Diminution._

Such is a _Glance_ at the Sound of a Word to which the Machine Accedes
to the Lineaments of _inexact Desire._

Such is the Lurker, always already Visible, given the Intravenous of a
Body under Siege or Examination. And I am _distraught_ in the midst of
my Desire as well, aroused to an Hysteric Degree, simply by the Sight
or Site of that Sliver, that Inscription of what is Already Heard.
