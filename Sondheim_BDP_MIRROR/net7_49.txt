I don't know what happened but I am now NOT LOGGED into NETCO and am on

a different shell entirely with all sorts of blinking things - I just

got out of an AYN RAND IRC!!!

I don't have the vaguest Idea where I am (platonic or not) but I better

check out soon - system crashed.



I don't know who I am I think I was talking to people about AYN RAND and

there was something about a screwdriver. I wonder if Tiffany whoever

has any idea that I'm talking about her through her talking about a

screwdriver...
