"I name our universe among multiverses Our Neighborhood = ON, 
and within 6000 languages here and billions elsewhere, the 
translation of ON or ON within a parenthetical, the performative 
of nomenclature, {}ON{} to be dissipated and interpreted or 
discard as unfit or fit. I pray and {s}pray particles and 
configurations that this might be the case. I {s}pray that this 
might be the case."

Fundamental Barrier. Categorial Surfacings. Limit. Singularity.
Primordial Mathesis. Generation Tantra. Completion Tantra. 
Not Our Universe. {}ON{} and {}NON{}. 

As if mathesis _cohered._ As if there were _inhabitation_ within 
one or another _body._ As if _body_ were _space_ and _time._ As 
if we become that. As if we _became_ that. As if we're _here 
now._ As if we _were._

_Dance_ which is _all movement._ As if it _were._

_Edgespace_ equals _gamespace_ equals _blankspace._ 
The _juncture,_ _incipient._ The _entanglement._

Among _entanglement, striations._ _They among them._

_Among among._
