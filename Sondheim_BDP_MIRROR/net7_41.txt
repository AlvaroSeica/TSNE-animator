[1] One condemns even Sartre, *Anti-Semite and Jew*: "I am aware

that Spinoza, Husserl, and Bergson have made place for intuition in

their systems. But the intuition of Spinoza is _rational,_ which

means that it is based on reason, is guaranteed by criticism, and 

has universal truth as its object. It has no resemblance to the 

Pascalian subtlety of spirit, and it is this latter - unasnwerable,

emotional, based on a thousand imperceptible perceptions - which to

the Jew seems his worst enemy." At this rate, Levinas and I are 

church-going Catholics.



[2] The Net, too, is partial and indeterminate; beyond D&G nomadism,

there is the _real_ Net-Diaspora, the scattering of virtual commu-

nities united across increasingly problematic boundaries. The Net is

the presence and skein of the book itself, its physical matrix at

a remove, sublevels of Net protocols that remain invisible to the 

user. If the Book opens its face to the sun, the Net exists in a 

darkness illuminated only by the presence of the Text.
