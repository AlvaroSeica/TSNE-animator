war, re/morse


this message is written in code.
it says i hate you.
no this message is a translation.
this message says i hate jews.
the message is written in code.
it says i hate black-americans. no, this is a code.
do you know what a code is. i am addressing
this to _you._ you know who they are.
this is why i remain silent. you know
what you know. you know what they know.
you know this message is in code; it says:
we hate serbs and albanians. therefore
this is a double message - decode:
i am so very hated for everything
that i do believe in my heart:
that you may put more holes in my body:
you may sew them up again.
that you may put more holes in my body,
so may you sew them up again.
so this message is written in code; 
and it says: tonight we will eat human meat,
and tomorrow we will finish the rest of the
animals.
we shall decipher the world,
then we shall decipher the rest of the world.
