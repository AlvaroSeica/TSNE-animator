Breakthrough - (Foofwa, please note)


motion capture filed performance in Second Life

(this is kludged to the highest degree)

I must admit for a change I'm quite happy with the results here. They're 
difficult to capture outside of the space, but the videos will give you an 
idea. Foofwa, there the potential of the Octopus here. Maud, you don't 
know what you're missing.

This just gets it started. Could the avatar push out infinitely into the 
unruptured catastrophic space of the edges of Second Life? Furious flight 
slammed against members-only barriers. The raw deal of equally infinite 
speed. 

the following was earlier, resonant

more experimentation with SL debris, fallen organs

Howtodisappear



The disappearance of the branch into hardened rock and occasional 
artifacts. The root of the avatar is elsewhere; the avatar itself, the 
image-avatar, is ghost. The ghost travels through anything of course; it's 
nothing more than coordinates. Howtodisappear.mov, however primitive, is 
the beginning of transparency, wizard listening-posts on MOOs for example.
Here we are, the virtual becoming-virtual still.
