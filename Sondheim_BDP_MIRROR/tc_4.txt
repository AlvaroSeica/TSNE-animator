preparations for our new cd, Threnody, coming soon.

the audio might be the strangest I've made; there are
two stages - live revrev with running two parallel 
programs, with live jinashi shakuhachi and madal input 
(I played them together), and post-production with 
pitch shift. I keep thinking: anticipatory music
(future perfect tense) combined with sound from the
_other side_ - and what might time be there? I love
this piece and the unexpectedness of it.

please send any feedback you might have on these pieces;
i'm not sure of either of them. my ghichak is a museum
piece; i'm giving it to the National Music Museum next
month, because of its delicacy; see

playing sounds rough to me; the alto sounds better and
with the delay and descent at the end of the phrases, it
creates a sense of tilt i think.

1. the haunting

threnody, mourning, lamentations, wailing, ululuations ...

"no, what's left the body, left of the body, the haunting the 
trace, my sleep my dreams, ghosts haunting, haunched on my 
shoulders, unbearable magnetic storms, I can imagine them, my 
dreams, present because it is.  And is there in fact a haunting? 
In any case, something makes one a haunting-screen, coming up 
against the body, covering my whereabouts - this Alan haunting 
my dreams, this Alan signifying neutral expression, haunted by 
memories of haunting, plastered, I explain. The haunting of the 
world by ghosts, virtual beings, dreams and nightmares and the 
psychoanalytics of the image, the haunting of the imaginary - 
which brings dreams of death without recompense or memory). I 
think the harbinger of permanent loss to come scratched speech 
on your white stretched skin and nubbed tips haunting under the 
cloak of night, swollen skin and nubbed tips haunting me through 
a presence or uncanny phantom, the voice descends from the 
haunting of memory chords, and corrosion or neurasthenia as the 
world swayed and rippled."

i was going to write a long piece, 
This isn't my Country, and worked it out at length
in the middle of the night, how violence dominates
at this point, virulence, people can't talk to each
other, violence erupts in the middle of conversation,
on the street, within our minds, our own fury takes
over, our mind grapples with terror we have bred
inside us, we spawn among ourselves and devour 
ourselves, driving in Rhode Island, trucks come up
behind me, they want to crash into me, drive me off
the road, run over what's left of my face, we can't
die now anymore now, can we

so I stopped writing and armored the car and made
it full of guns and I go down the street and watch

For me, this was about pushing - not against, but through -
the aural landscapes created by revrev, the sound system

architectures and potentials of the instruments. Applause

using a good condenser mic beneath the qin,
what happens? then edited in audition,
nothing added or subtracted. the qin is an 
unbounded world with seven highways, many
rest stops, trails everywhere. the qin is
heir to philosophical thinking in china and
elsewhere; like shakuhachi music, space is
constructed, eddies, withdraws, dialogs 
with silence and emptiness. 

the other video, of a zoom h4n, records the
sound-light in the cave environment; i
thought of it as an absorptive punctum, an
inversion of the media display.

Another Avatar Woman review (from England) - 

http://www.terrascope.co.uk/Reviews/Rumbles_March_15.htm

I'm afraid my ability to play will give out; what if I
have a stroke or heart attack? So I'm hurrying, working 
on the next album which stresses technique and speed in 
relation to mourning and unredeemable death. Many of
these instruments have traveled with me; here they are.
Contrary to the review above, I've released something
like ten cds/albums/cassettes at least; they tend to 
disappear, I don't. I think through thought, in music 
and without music; for me, these are more than pieces;
they're something else, indefinable, they rescue me for
other work, the virtual work for example. For what it's 
worth, I don't think of myself as a cyberspace theorist,
but as a shape-shifter, if shape there be; it's thinking
and thinking through. Scroll all the way down for the 
review.

(And whatever you do, don't tell me I'm old; I've had
enough ageism recently to last for several lifetimes.)



Erhu

http://www.alansondheim.org/erhuand.jpg *
http://www.alansondheim.org/qqqqviolin.mp3 erhu

Replaced the violin piece by an erhu piece, same
address. 1. It's more adventuresome. 2. It sounds
better. 3. It was difficult. 4. Around 30 seconds
you can hear a motorcycle. 5. The ending has an
interesting bow slippage. 6. It's an erhu!!!
[...]

We just set up a more reasonable configuration
for the Motu and computer; the erhu sounds travel
into the ultrasonic which made it hard for the 
lavalier to work well; instead I duplicated the
instrument mic. In the meantime, playing is
compounded by my tinnitus, which creates beats/
interference patterns; my ear-dreaming, phantom
hearing, takes over and the result is strange; I
have to play through and above/below what I hear,
which is not entirely coming from the instrument.
The next beat of my heart might be mirrored in 
the madal, but not here. In any case, I think the
piece is quite good, worthy of hearing, rushed,
running wild at the limit of my physical/musical
capabilities. [...]

* erhu in foreground, sarangi, ghichak, and 
suroz behind. The sarangi is now owned by
Stephen Dydo; the ghichak and suroz will be
going to the National Music Museum in South 
Dakota. [...]



What happens when I fill the room in my head

http://www.alansondheim.org/espsession12.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/qqqqalto.mp3

The image is from our recording session which
resulted in Avatar Woman and Cutting Board.
The music - well it's alto clarinet sent through
the MOTU set for a 12 second reverb; that's what
I heard through the headphones and I was curious
how it would be to play that way. It took all
night to set up, indicative of the difficulty I
have with soundboard configurations. I was also
reacting to my fear of tinnitus interfering with
everything; here, I made sure it wasn't an issue
but I'm walking around the erhu suspiciously. In
any case, this piece is annoying, strange, and
insistent, and I love the tonalities the clarinet
was able to produce against itself in a space 
that never seemed to end.

poor little things

the making of poor little things

http://www.alansondheim.org/poorthingsb.mp4

the drift of the narrative

the slight raising of filter barriers, enough to let the poor 
thing _in_? and then, Pox on't, why do I speak of these poor 
things? and then, but a poor thing; ornamented, it sloughs into 
the symbolic.

the mise en scene

http://www.alansondheim.org/poorlittle6.png
http://www.alansondheim.org/poorlittle8.png

the poor little things when the shift from virtual virtual
to virtual physical and all the poor little things happen
and every little things is unhappy and these are the roles
of depression when everything transforms into emptiness
among things that should be replete and fecund and when
everything that grows dissolves and leaves a sweet sticky
taste of itself and all the little others in a soft tawdry
trail dissolving in the tears of small whimperings and
even though you know how this is created in the narrative
and mise en scene and the making of the making of poor
little things you can't help feeling sorry for them and
for your lives and the anguish and suffering in our world
that used to be so beautiful so wonderful that we would
sing of it and celebrate it and walk softly in its 
shadows and now we are very very small and murmuring and
our hearts our broken among the fabric of our world

how ironic that virtual virtual objects turning into
physical virtual objects begin to take on suffering and

how unutterably sad that our lives are defined by the
days of our births and days of our deaths and all of 
this is different among us and our loved ones and 
among our families and among others and

how quickly conversations and deep discussions and
disagreements end so sadly with the death of one and
the death of another and

how irrevocable the world is, the poor little things 
of the world and the poor little things we remember 
until we are forgotten and

oh i sing of these things, threnody and ululuations,
mourning and lamentations, and the greyness of the world
in our last and fading shining hour




the simplest system of improvisation

Henry Gunckel simple systen clarinet, mid-19th century
with Luke Damrosch revrev and convolution programs.

meanwhile the clarinet has a crack that needs to be filled,
an afternoon project sometime after the chemistry arrives.
it's been a difficult day but we went about our ordinary
business.

the clarinet has five unringed holes, everything for slurs,
odd intervals, glissandos; technically it's a 13-key
instrument before the HP/LP designations, high pitch / low
pitch. this is not the standard or full Albert system, but
as its description suggests, simpler, with the forked F
(relative to the standard pitch) fingering that's a real
nuisance. the tone is somewhere among bagpipe, duduk, folk
clarinets in general, and very easy to modify.

all of this will stop after the recording sessions in May.
I know now this is a material for talking to myself about
sound that I hear below the tinnitus and that it is a good
sound and I will make it and retire into a virtual world
with this sound and it will be there with me.
