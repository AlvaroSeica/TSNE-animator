war, T-junction


you're hurtling down the road,
one-hundred, two-hundred miles an hour
suddenly, you come to a T-junction
you brake hard, come to a halt
you're facing across the road
it's like an open field
the road goes to your left and right
where are you facing, furious person.
you see across it, you know
  it doesn't go anywhere, you know
  it's uncanny, this wide opening
  to nowhere, it's as if
  the world skids around the world
each and every structure
  you've ever heard about
  suddenly is naked, maybe you,
  mumbling:
    "There isn't any!"
