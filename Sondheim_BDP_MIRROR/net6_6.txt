ADDICTION





I don't know what to do with myself; my dreams are uneasy, a vast

spew into the ocean of darkness - the decay of language signalled

by information garbled throughout the screen at the back of the 

mind - I'm nervous, don't eat properly -



I'm missing out on it. I'm missing out on everything in the world.

What it is - an enormous event, something cancelling myself, the

rush of correspondence beyond me, always elsewhere - I've been

effaced -



I've been effaced - a murder by virtue of forgetfulness - so that

there's nothing left of me - have to watch my appetite - nothing

goes away -



So I return to the machine and the server is down or return and the

message is confused, garbage everywhere in the midst of the urgency

of the written. 

 

All messages are urgent, say everything there is to say. But beyond

this - I'm sure I'm missing the Cypher. The Cypher is the unlocking

of this and every other message, their value. It is the Cypher that

connects the surface triviality of the message to the deep

structure - the suturing of the body, foreclosing of the wound

which allowed the light to seep. For if it isn't the text itself,

always visible and the emptying of secrets, it's the Cypher - a

permanent interiority. 



The Cypher is the far end, the horizon of addiction; drugless and

independent, it is the control of the addict. It is the offering of

the maternal where none exists, the presentification of the self to

the self, the closure of the Fort-Da! where what had existed

previously was always already disappearance, a fund of exhaustion

within the retreat of the existential.



The Cypher, to consider it from a different vantage-point, is the

_structure_ of the existential project, the armature or

scaffolding. It is the rim of the hole.



The Cypher is the lip of the hole which is a recipient and the lip

is silent or silences itself. It is the only silence in the world

of addiction, what keeps the movement occurring when the server is

on, when the message is clear, when the fingers enter themselves

and the rest of the flesh into a world open with opportunity and

grace. The Cypher is the _tendency_ of the chatter, the final

pleasure of the imminent.



(I have no pleasure and no ending of the pleasure. I cannot hear

you through the noise. I am led to believe...)

CAN'T STOP WRITING / NO CAN'T STOP WRITING / CAN'T STOP WRITING /

MYSELF



CAUSE I DO THEORY MALE CAUSE I DO THEORY / CAUSE I DO THEORY MAIL /

CAUSE IT'S DONE TO ME 





I write and write; there is no end to it. The files pile up at the rate

of a megabyte a year, enormous files, ASCII, linear, although not

without a certain tendentious quality... They are belly, language-fat,

collapsed body or hidden body as they grow beyond belief.



This is what I _do_, from late morning rising to equally late night

preparing for fitful sleep. This is what keeps me going, the body

decaying beneath me, flesh falling off as the wires heat up. And the

wires heat up. (The flesh falls, blood between my legs. I'll get

back to this, back to the blood; I'll write with the blood, get back

to this.)



The wires heat up because there is nothing else for me, nothing but

the _spit of meaning_ my work occasions, disturbance of the ether.

I know nothing but the inhabitation of my thought, this continuous

meditation that lacerates me, cuts unequivocally. (It's not the cut

that bleeds the legs, swoon/languor/lassitude, something else: it's

_something else._)



You are the edge of the written, the circumscription that presents

the exteriority of the skull. This body meets itself in death; there

may no longer be this body which is a writing-machine by virtue of

a written declaration. I have lost my arms and legs. I have lost my

eyes and ears. (I'll get back to this, back to myself.)



Theory is hideous, an addiction; I cannot live without REMAKE, RE-

WRITE. The shifter shifts from _I_ to the entire passage itself,

everything a violent and sickening announcement, signalled by 

uncontrollable dejection. My tongue leaves the body; I am left with

arms. My arms leave my tongue; my legs carry the body, one or another

direction, violent meander.



I would do what you tell me to, everything you want, everything you

could possibly desire, but I do not exist. There are no words to

describe it. (I rip myself open, spread the ass rim until the split

opens up into the holing of _this text_, WRITING me back into cartoon

me returned to where I began with the splitting.)



>I'm just a singsong, I'm just a song on your tongue, 

>I'm just your tongue in my mouth, I'm just the blood in my mouth:

>I'm just the blood on my hand, I'm just the blood on my cock,

>I'm just the blood on my legs, just the blood belly-up



>>I'd write the blood if I were you, I'd baptise in the blood of

>>the Lord. And the Lord bleeds once a month once a year so it 

>>REWRITES so it was written. 

>>So it REWRITES on the tablets of clay, REWRITES once a day,

>>once an hour. _I can't keep my hands off myself._



_I can't keep my hands off myself, I can't keep my hands away. They 

tie me, hold me back, cut the lips of the cunt, cauterize my anus,

bleed me; they scar my neck, brand my forehead; they strangle the

cock, stuff the cunt. I'd say they blind me because I don't have

second sight. I'd say they tear the tongue, block the ears; I'd say

they KEEP ME FROM MYSELF, stuff the mouth, block the nose. I can't

keep away from myself, suck myself; I'm always sucking myself, I

suck you through me, suck myself in, turn inside-out, I'm there for

you - they can't keep their hands off me, they tie me, hold me back._



My fist goes in, comes out my mouth, my fist goes in, comes out my

ass, circulates; caught in REWRITE without the other, Body Without

Organs the decomposition of the body of RWANDA EAST TIMOR AUSCHWITZ,

cauterization of the violating male (everything caught in the path,

everything erased from the text, silenced from language into shrieks

screams blurred against erasure).



I rewrite cause there isn't a woman to help me

I rewrite cause I gotta get born

I wanna get born I gotta get born, as if:

I'm making sense, as if: _I gotta get born, I wanna get born._

So the sun's gonna bring it, and the sun's gonna die

So the moon's gonna bring it, and the son's gonna die

Cause I can't help it, can't help the man

Cause I can't hold it, cause I can't stop dreaming

My hands holding me, hands loving me

Hands holding me, hands in perfect love

Cause I gotta write gotta REWRITE (before I forget my name, before

my name is taken from me, before the loss of my name, before the

disappearance of naming, before you forget me, before you forget me

and I lose my name) -

Suspension FAQ 





[From posting to film.theory. Would this apply as well to Internet

communication, mediated by ASCII?]





Coleridge's "willing suspension" is found in chapter XIV, Biographia

Literaria. He is speaking of "the plan of the _Lyrical Ballads_; in

which it was agreed that my endeavours should be directed to persons

and characters supernatural, or at least romantic; yet so as to

transfer from our inward nature a human interest and a semblance of

truth sufficient to procure for these shadows of imagination that

willing suspension of disbelief for the moment, which constitutes

poetic faith."



I associate a libidinal energy or drive with "procure," and note that

the "semblance of truth" is exactly what occurs through genre or

convention, the suturing of the domain of the film in order to

_engage_ the viewer within an imaginary. 



I associate the scopic/cinematic regime with "shadows of imagination,"

noting only in passing that it is possible to construct a reference

to Plato's cave at this point, an insinuation that the real itself

is always already a suspension of disbelief, which returns inverted

in cinematic belief, if one desires, a laterality or stuttering

between regimes, privileging neither.



I associate "moment" simultaneously with the momentary and myth of

origin, and "faith" with a gesture invading _beyond_ the poetic

itself, the last phrase referring to a stasis from which imagination

proceeds.



I associate "to transfer from our inward nature" ... "a semblance of

truth" with psychoanalytical transference, also operative within

the interiority of cinematic engagement; and with "truth" nothing

more than an acceptable coherency within a believable frame.



Thus there are two problems - that of filmic convention, suture,

and diegetic construction (all involving tropologies; symptomolo-

gies; phenomenologies of editing, framing, and so forth) - and that

of the _state of suspension itself_, involving a degree of release

of operations occurring within the preconscious/unconscious. "Willing"

itself is the link between the problems; it is _occasioned_ by the

operations of the former in order to produce the latter. It is 

not an always-already decision or choice in the midst of the 

conscious, but the release of an interior within which operations

paralleling the dreamwork occur.



What are these parallels?



Both film and dream construe the scopic regime against an unimagined

and darkened backdrop.

Both film and dream appear autonomously _set-in-motion_.

In both, the ego-decision is most often made by an anonymous other

(I found myself in a room... I found myself flying...).

In both, jumpcuts and other traditionally cinematic devices are

common, and in both, the viewpoint is that of a camera-eye which

"follows" narrative.

In both, there is a preconscious recognition of the frame, the 

_screen beyond the screen_.

And both occur within a _particular_ ritualized events, sleep or the

movement towards the theatre (theatrical).





Finally I note that what Coleridge describes is in a relation to the

programmatic development of _Lyrical Ballads_, differing from the

contribution of Wordsworth. For Coleridge, the suspension is in 

regard to a particular romanticism of the fantastic; perhaps film

is also _only_ a romantic development.
