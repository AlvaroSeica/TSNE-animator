pleasant
nightshots.
no crickets
here!

boughs bend to
night-shot spirit

sony haiku:
adjust the lens!

lightless light -
everything in this cold world
needs batteries

the big test
of zero-lux weather

winter wind
ecstatic steadi-shot -
what trembling!

oh breathe deeply -
autofocus and spirit -
both unforgiving
