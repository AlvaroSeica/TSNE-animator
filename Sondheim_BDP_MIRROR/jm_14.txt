Paste is when music no longer sounds the beats of the world, doubling and
dividing, distinction and rhythm pertinent the realm of natural numbers. 
Paste is how the world emerges, submerges, inchoate dissimulations as I
let you down, let myself down, no longer speak in throes of suffocation. 
Paste is why I fuck myself, open cunts in the cocktip, churn flesh back
into flesh, splay body, descend into the maelstrom of cultural debris. 
Paste is where the world is found, cold Jennifer's panties grounding her
language while she stands, brushes off, walks in her brand-new frock.
Paste is who we are, obscene twin tumors cathected into one another, bore-
dom, and defuge, cancers devouring the remnants of grave and graven flesh.
Paste is what drives us, blinding eyes, muting ears, violating mouths and
hands as we inscribe the last _xy_ in planetary depression and psychosis. 
Paste is wherefore, wither, the question, last abscesses of graphemes, as
if there were meaning, distributed or otherwise than being, annulled.
