bruises


marks on my shoulder, marks on my neck
blue, yellow, black, time-warped
marks and faded marks around my breasts
teeth, fingers, tongue, space-marked
around her breasts and neck and around her shoulders
here and there inland by the sea
across and down my lower back, on her back
clear liquids holed up in my marks
clear liquids holed up in her marks
blood on the bed and my face, between her legs, and clothes
blood liquids between my legs
bitten nails and fingers, wrists
dense liquids pooled up on the bed
o fierce
