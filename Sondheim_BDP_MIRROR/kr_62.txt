Not Elementals, Indescribable Whats


(4)If not primordials, not elementals, indescribable whats, imaginaries,
you might think of a _singularity_ as a name, you might think of a _chao-
tic domain_ as Jennifer (you never know!), you might think of clean bifur-
cations or splits as hypertextings. Then Jennifer is already past or prior
to the name, and what's Jennifer? Think of a conflation of _tellings_ or
strands, think of irruptions, momentary forgetfulnesses within the strands
- all within the chaotic domain. Then are we looking into the movements,
say, of the damped(1) and driven(2) pendulum(3)?

(1)wetted, slowed, Jennifer returning speech to silence, silence to touch,
touch to taste, taste to ground(4)
(2)driven, heated, Jennifer interfering with systems resonances
(3)pendulum, pendulous, Jennifer rocking back and forth, echolalias across
applications, eddying rings(5)

(5)Spreading out, spanning (bandwidths), borderline personalities frayed
at the edges, margins, potential wells.

Swollen tumescences, convexities; meniscus lenses, sinusoidal meanderings:
dependent upon metric geometries. But not the meanderings themselves. Well
Jennifer might put it this way, there are so many tellings, they make a
space, even though it doesn't seem like one. You've got to add the proto-
cols to make everything visible, Peirce's sheet of assertion at the least.
But the tellings don't need that, don't need the breathings, well only for
you to see or hear or touch or taste or smell them. But that's an emana-
tion.
