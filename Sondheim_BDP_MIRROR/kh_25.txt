Parable


No matter how far the experience of Daishin Nikuko, she has not seen so
much anger-anxiety present in faces presented to her since her arrival.
Nor has she seen such confusion-tension, nor such information-explosion in
the midst of excessive noise, and Daishin Nikuko must wonder, were I not a
fully contributor of this race, what on earth has been the occasion for
such constitution. But then, if I would say get me out of here, would I
not imply a betrayal and of whom and for which principles, for which I am
much adjusted? These are things to think about as since I am well aware
there is nothing else to think about. Nor is there space to think about
such things where there is no takonoma anywhere in site. I need an alcove
to contemplate and be contemplated. There I will carry on my parable act-
ivity. 

To write a parable, one must have brush and ink or computer and voice-rec-
ognition in hand or before mouth; one must have sparkling ideas and a
clear and steady mind. Without space and time there is no parable. Here I
believe that everyone does die, but outside of space and outside of time
and certainly outside of takonoma. 

The parable is dying outside of space and time, while I, Daishin Nikuko,
fumble for keyboard and brush.
