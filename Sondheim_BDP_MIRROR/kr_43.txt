(Jennifer) Alan says we should have a profile.
(Alan) Yes, for example, weight, height, things like that.
(Nikuko) Why should we bother; it's nothing to us.
(Alan) It's true it makes little sense.
A little rain, in fact, begins to fall in someone's life.
(Jennifer) Well, I'm twelve and on the verge.
(Nikuko) You mean virga, rain that falls but doesn't wet the ground.
(Jennifer) More like a hinge of weight or height.
A little rain, in fact, gains weight from greater height.
@quit Nikuko
(Jennifer) What?
(Alan) Nikuko's just quit; this is getting depressing.
(Jennifer) Must be the showers that are coming in...
Puddles collect, Jennifer's frock is spattered, the ground cools.
