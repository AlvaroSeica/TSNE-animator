If a friend or a child who is a friend desires to find the means for pro-

curing the elements of a poison guaranteed to frighten all within the 

vicinity of feigned death, it is no more difficult than if a child or a

friend of a child designs to ascertain the appearance of others without

the protective raiment of everyday wear by means of procuring such imple-

ments of infrared observation as are obtainable at any espionage outlet.



And if a young woman deigns to seduce an older man by means of bouquets

which delight and ennervate the sensory apparatus accustomed to years of

normal practice, it is no more than the dialup of a world wide web server

plying its wares across the electronic skyway bringing democracy and the

edges of the personality to every neighborhood of your house and my own.



Now if a young man places his designs upon the smaller animals of the

self-same neighborhood, he may look no farther than the transfer of files

of mystery and ecstasy exquisitely formatted for the members of the fe-

line race, behavior outposts signalling the canine-kind entrance into 

rampant vandalism and thugees.



Thus if a tiny boy desires the services of an older woman past her time

and degree of hormonal sexualism pursuant to the creaton of creatures 

like himself, he may purvey gerontological postings to medical data-bases

subsumed by men whose hairlines, like his own, leave much to be desired,

by themselves, himself, or those who fall fallow of his troubled dreams.



Thus if a young man were walking by the woods on a day in summer, he would

happen to stop by the side of a rivulet where others of his kind bathed

naked, clean and smoothed bodies slipping like silver fish beneath the

shores and banks, and so lined with tiny roots meandering down to the sur-

plus of liquid for the taking, the asking, with infinite kindness.



Thus would the animal and vegetable kingdoms and queendoms celebrate with

haste, undue the freeing of desires upon which the eyelids leave their 

trace, images found hovering just outside or beyond the bordering of posts

to realms unknown, mossy dreams spoken of by fallen leaves of trees, the 

moisture gathered together where one, young or old, has implemented visage

with unholy truths, stirrings on the surface of the world, murmurings of 

its depths.
