the virtuous, for whom to give thanks, rampage and ravage,
for whom the slaughter, for whom the last gesture of the
hands, last moment where _i hear_ such as music, as what
might be passed to you, this bonfire of pipa and violin,
this spark of genius in the ashes of auschwitz and 
plymouth colony, origin of rendering for our mutual 
history, read and destroyed. for whom the slaughter or
birds and other animals to fill our greed of religion, 
gold, and what remains. the earth is remnant, remain,
residue, the earth is history always and already beneath
effacement, what erasure have i on the past's truncation,
why this presence of genius ego in the midst of ego, to
which nothing answers, nothing succumbs, but everything,
so much fostering left, so much allure


Mocking

http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/mocking1.mp3 soprano recorder
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/mocking1.mp3 sarangi with new
 sarangi bow

Solo soprano recorder for a short time, then longer sarangi
piece. Mocking because mocking birds take short notes/notice,
as do these. Not in the sense of denigration but recourse to
honorifics and acknowledgment. Please enjoy: God does.

sound of the one finger stopping in the frog pond
where the butterfly fingers the novice; it says
all bonkers are forgiven in the end
