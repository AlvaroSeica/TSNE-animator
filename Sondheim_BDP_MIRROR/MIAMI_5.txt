o, susan graham, you are made for me
a glorious hammer comes down and hits you on the head
a brick falls from a top building (one of the best)
water bursts from the ground and drowns you

oh, susan gram, you are made for me
nothing like this happens
you are safe with me! why bother
with anything when the universe turns cold 

ohh, susan g, you are made for me
the ground opens up and swallows its very snake
you are saved because the snake comes out first
and then is swallowed by the very ground it has
come out of first

it is that very first, susan, i respect and admire you
