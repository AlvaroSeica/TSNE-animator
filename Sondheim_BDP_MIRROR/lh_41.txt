They were walking near Kokura. Who will listen to us, said Nikuko, and how
will they listen. Izanagi replied, by the sound of the breeze and whispers
in dreams. Nikuko said, That is absurd, only what the poets say. Izanagi
thought for a moment and asked, Do you have a better idea. They'll go the
crazier for it, said Nikuko, no one will believe them, better to talk just
like they do, out loud with as much noise as possible, when they're awake
and the air is still. We can't let them miss a thing, laughed Izanagi,
we're so important. What did you say, said Nikuko. They boarded the ferry
to Nagato, still talking away.
