Swallowing Wires





I don't want to run away. I want to swallow wires. I want them wrapped 

around the throat, they'll wrap in a helical hyperbola, pushing out the 

breasts pushing out the mind. I want the rim of them. I want the rim of 

them, wrapped around me, swollen name stitched into the back of the neck 

where I can't read. There's got to be the truth of this social security 

number, birthdate, and all the bad things I ever did.



There's got to be the wires. They've _got_ to be where I can't read them 

because I feel too guilty to read the truth. They burn into the back of 

my neck. They brand me with my crimes like a geek code that's invisible 

with a translation I can't find. I carry around the puckered neck. I 

carry around the puckered neck which is where I am that I can't be.



I want to swallow wires.
