another attempt obviating moire/lissajous. site passed Vegas a while ago:

site has no weight, thin slice; what the screen does, inertial mass, some- 
thing else, carrier or parasite. it all disappears shortly after death. I 
need someone creating hardware, stone, nonexistent inscriptive bulwark. 
Julu cries out of Titus Andronicus, will be forgotten. words lose tongues 
and hands, painlessly, but extrinsic, unable to testify. no testimony, no 
annihilation; successful annihilation is no annihilation at all. memory 
relies on death, diacritical-death, as if something were amiss. tongues 
and hands are painful; Second Life, airless, disappears among them. Waking 
this morning I realized this work is unbelievably flimsy, fragile, entire- 
ly disappearing at the end of the residency - a radical disassembly that 
hardly passes for erasure - given that nothing existed here in the first 
place. This absence becomes an unreadable epitaph under erasure. These 
words, too owe their existence to the imminence of electrical charges far 
and beyond that of paper, stone, scissors, rock. So it goes and doesn't 
return.

moss 


moss textures from the atoll package.
moss is neither volume nor surface; maximal and exquisite, fondling earth 
or bark or stone, it portends maternal fecundity, Julu Twine murmuring in 
her sleep.
moss is temperate, comforting, meandering lazily among ants and lichen. 
so many microbes, so much going on, in a pillow of soft and entrancing
moss!
moss in air, tendrils floating, almost, but not quite, hanging.
moss of mist, mist-moss, the very depth of organism!
neither object nor clothing surface lovely Julu Twine!
Julu Twine inhabits moss creatures, lichen, air-plankton creatures, 
misted, glowing, submerged, subterranean, in the midst of quiet winds.
moss softens what was hard, blurs what was defined, obscures what was 
clear, colors what was transparent, warms what was cool, hugs and delights 
in stone and earth, embraces bark - yes, mist-creatures, the slightest of 
fogs.
moss is always an ellipsis, speaking of moss is memory of moss.
even in front of one, moss is a memory, close to disappearance, 
evanescent.
close to disappearance, closed to disappearance. 
moss is open and closed, closed and open - look, it's almost forgotten!
the sward, mobile and translucent; Julu says more organism! more organism!
Julu Twine separates hirself from moss and memory, lichen and bark, air 
and water and earth. But moss separates itself as well; equivalence 
tunnels through equivalence; moss and Julu Twine emerge; here's where 
inscription starts and falters!

Excerpt



	January 25. I was working at the table while Seryozha was lying on 
the sofa and reading some tattered book with a green cover. Suddenly he 
jumped up and explained:

	"Sasha! Just a minute. Listen to this!"

	"I'm listening."

	As solemnly and loudly as if he were reading to an audience of 
thousands he read to me:

	"'To deliver up millions of men, superior minds, scientists, even 
geniuses, to the caprice and will of a being who in an instant of gaiety, 
madness, intoxication, or love, would not hesitate to sacrifice everything 
for his exalted fancy, will spend the wealth of the country amassed by 
others with difficulty, will have thousands of men slaughtered on the 
battlefields, all this appears to me, a simple logician, a monstrous 
aberration.' Pretty good eh?"

	"Swell!" I agreed. "About Hitler, Eh?"

	"You certainly hit the nail on the head!" said Seryozha bursting 
out laughing. "That's Maupassant, brother, 'The Sundays of a Parisian'!"

	Somewhat embarrassed, I laughed too.

	"Not so long ago I gave a talk on Hitlerism," said Seryozha. "I 
was asked why Hitler is burning the classics. I answered that fascism was 
the enemy of culture in general and so on. But what I should have done was 
read this page from Maupassant. It would have answered the purpose better. 
Pity I didn't get hold of this book before. This is one straight in the 
eye for crazy Adolf. There isn't a single classic in which he can't find a 
crack at himself. That's why he got so raving ad and gave orders to burn 
them all. Freaks don't keep mirrors in their houses. A mirror reminds them 
of their freakishness and only irritates them."

	Then Seryozha took out his notebook and copied the quotation. 
Feeling extremely pleased with himself he began to walk around the room 
whistling an aria from "Carmen."

[ ... ]

	Seryozha has summed up the work of the crew. We have 160 opera- 
tional flights to our credit. We've done 180,000 kilometres over enemy 
territory and dropped more than 200 tons of bombs on various targets. We 
took a hand in defending Moscow, saw action on the Kharkov and Voronezh 
Fronts and around Leningrad and Stalingrad. We've flown to Germany and to 
Hitler's vassal countries. I must say that the "itinerary" of our crew 
looks quite impressive.

	"We've done what we could," said Sergei. "Wish to God that every- 
one could do the same. And I hope that before the end of the war we'll 
still manage to add something or other to our score. Right, Sasha?"

	"Right," said I. "If only we're alive we certainly will."



From A. Molodchy, "180,000 Kilometres over Enemy Territory," in An Army 
of Heroes, True Stories of Soviet Fighting Men, translated from the
Russian by Elizabeth Donnelly, Foreign Languages Publishing House, Moscow, 
1944.





1,2,3 sequences


1, universal slaughterhouse of the scrawl


death is accompanied by the annihilation of memory, the annihilation of
death. the political economy of death: I will Julu Twine to you; I will
Nikuko Dojoji to you. Nikuko Dojoji passes beneath the sign of Alan, Alan
Dojoji, another quality of identification that disappears. The beginning
of cache-drawing in Second Life, the opening of the maw of the true world,
virtual real, is gray mass, gray goo, outlines devoid of color. What is
discernible is the growing, cawing, of memory always already at work
signifying what is to come: proper names for these puppets or extensions,
these flesh-works redolent of the human. Inscribe Julu Twine, and that is
hir beginning and ending; hir cunt is dry fold in protocol codework dead-
space; hir skin tears at the seams. Look closely and frisson disappears
into ridging, swollen rips in the fabric of visual presence. Look closer
and real slaughter begins.

2, invasions


http://www.alansondheim.org/ once jpgs

torso-moss destruction of a great nation.
an environment for all ages and ideologies.
a platform for espousal of new ideas.
a compilation of redolent primitivism.
one-sided imaginary of dream-world imagery.
armies of the non-economic.
ruptured slaughterhouse of sea and island.
political economic of bandwidth bandits.

These will stop. These will come to an end, these experiments in space,
time, movement, bandwidth, interaction, perception, virtuality. These
will absolutely stop. These will absolutely come to an end.

From the concrete, steel, and brick building of the Virtual Environments
Laboratory to the invisible, transparent, physical, translucent, and
opaque manifolds of the virtual reality of Second Life - this is a complex
domain of phenomenological experimentation that continues to expand and
surprise.


3, Julu Twine sky-writer


http://www.alansondheim.org/ flyingwoman jpgs 
http://www.alansondheim.org/spawn.mp4

Julu emits particle torso smoke, black smoker as undersea, seabottom, 
airless; her movements sky-write fluidly and beautifully for everyone 
to see. I can demonstrate live in Second Life; let me know when you 
might be present. In any case,

fully opened, fully closed


Julu Twine was tuned and retuned; the particle spew was moved from abdomen 
to chest - the bvh files had more movement in that region than in the 
pelvis, which was near the root node, and therefore fairly quiescent. 
Once the move was made, the invisible generator attachment was slid back 
into the area of the womb, since birth occurs in the tuning and retuning. 
What then? For the most part, a simulacrum or masquerade of a womb or 
pelvis or abdomen node. Symptoms develop: on occasion the source of torso 
generation moves from womb to a position outside the body of Julu Twine; 
it's following the chest, not the womb, and therefore a displacement 
occurs. Now with spawn - which is just that, spawn from loins as displace- 
ment from chest - it's possible to see Julu Twine in mid-air with full 
movement, and Julu Twine confined in an enclosed watery depression between 
building and earth. In the confinement, there is shuddering; in the shud- 
dering, there is masquerade and continuous torso production which appears 
to emerge freely from the space, a signal or at the very least, a sign. 
But this emergence, this torso, itself is a fantasm; it's nothing more 
than a texture, a detailed square patch which appears, from certain 
angles, to possess weight, dimension, volume. So this is one fantasm among 
many, but a fantasm which goes nowhere; it can't be grasped in Second Life 
and such couldn't be grasped anywhere. So the shuddering, this apparent 
simulacrum of sex, this byproduct of confinement according to the codes 
and protocols of Second Life, produces a signal and a frisson among non- 
existent bodies, perhaps among viewers, perhaps a thrill or shudder, 
again, at the birth of a symptom. It's this symptom, this excess of desire 
in confinement and plein air, that disturbs, is read, goes nowhere - and 
goes nowhere because of its autonomy, autonomic nervousness, autonomic 
neurosis, railroad kidney and railroad spine and the like. It's what 
appears to be a chance result of programming; it's in reality the uneasy 
confluence of programming and interoperability, and collisions among 
programs. I take full responsibility, at the same time releasing Julu 
Twine to her own amazing ends. Now I dream Julu Twine, I no longer know my 
own sex, but I own to no other and know no other, nor an other; it's all 
uncomfortable and dis/eased masquerade, something tawdry that I simultan- 
eously turn towards and away from, something in my character, a virus or 
parasite, a parasite of alterity, dreams of others, incandescent.

Liminal, slow


There are liminal moments when real and virtual intersect in a contrary 
and wayward matter, when Second Life, or any other program, isn't quite 
loaded, is only half present. Like the older work of jodi.org, the user's 
attention turns half towards immersion, and half towards anomaly - 
simultaneous tacit knowledge and paradox. Usually these moments are quick; 
sometimes they are slow, even permanent. There are also liminal spaces, 
which might be defined as equivalent, but there are also liminal spaces at 
game's edge, whether formed by island or height. Again, anomaly occurs; 
everything is problematic.

As I type this, I look out the window; there are light cumulus clouds in 
the dusk sky, reminiscent of Second Life dusk - but only if the Quality 
and Performance slider is set high; otherwise, the sky is blank, tawdry, 
unreal in any life. Here is yet another limit, and there are similar 
limits built into the software itself - details aren't all that fine, but 
as usual with avatars and landscapes, blank out into pixel-mania, no 
matter what the bandwidth. (And dreams? How are these configured; if one 
spends hours in Second Life, what happens then, if anything?)

Below are some images recorded on the Asus pc EEE 701, which loads and 
renders slow.

answering no one's critique +


To the criticism that my approach to Second Life is naive, apolitical 
ahistorical, and so forth: let me say this in my defense - that if one 
desires to study the phenomenology of any grouping of organisms, before * 
the overt socio-cultural issues are analyzed, it's necessary to understand 
the basics of their way of living, their space-time comprehension of 
whatever might pass for the real. To understand primates, for example, one 
might study their groupings (nations), customs, and conflicts in relation 
to strained resources - but one might study, first, their mode of being in 
the world, of which groupings, customs, and conflicts are at best only a 
developing part. ** The culture, the intrinsic and extrinsic political 
economy of Second Life, *** or any virtual world, are critical, but first 
comes the phenomenology of being-virtual in relation to the structural 
basics of that world. I realize I'm begging the question, that one can and 
does argue for political economy and culture, for that matter, all the way 
down - I've done that repeatedly myself. **** But the phenomenology and 
reach of virtuality is far greater and deeper than these institutions, 
***** although entangled and inhering within and without them; I want to 
look at what's possible, what a user might extend or expand towards, 
should she or he inhabit the psychological, physical, and phenomenological 
limits of a space. ****** Physiology, neurophysiology, psychogeography, 
topography, sexuality, for examples - abjection, debris, edge phenomena, 
server phenomena in relation to all of these. Later, although simultane- 
ous, construction, configuration, intrinsic and extrinsic economies, 
corporate and political affiliations and hacking, community and commun- 
ality, interfacing with other worlds including the physical. ******* It's 
the latter, institutionalization, deterritorialization, and so forth, that 
constitutes most of the analyses I've read ******** - issues of the 
rational or at least psychoanalytical and normative subject, ********* 
however defined. Problematizing these in relation to delirium, frisson, 
dirt, flight, coherency, primary identifications and narcissisms if such 
exist - these are areas I scuttle about, beneath the surface of the 
_thing._ As example, _I, Avatar_'s description of sexuality in terms of 
groups, wars, dialogs, narrative, but not in terms of arousal, ejacula- 
tion, sexual triggers, uneasy dreams, worlds falling apart. I know, here, 
I'm not expressing myself clearly (I'm writing under severe depression and 
a kind of mental chaos), ********** but the distinction's there and more 
than lip-service is needed in relation to what humans are doing to them- 
selves on a fundamental level within the concretization of fantasm, the 
uncanny, the untoward. *********** My site attempts ************ experien- 
cing and thinking through these things by circumscribing what's recogni- 
zable, navigable, accountable, and unaccountable, in both the physical 
world and these fully-inscribed worlds (protocols and code all the way 
down ************* ) that surface and run (are refreshed, refresh-rate 
************** ) in the midst of potential muck that may, for the parti- 
cipant, *************** problematize that very inscription (purity, in 
other words, towards impurity, acceptance towards stigma, clarity towards 
loss). (Don't worry, no one can do everything; the problem of course is if 
what's done bypasses or occludes inherent and necessary connections to 
what isn't. **************** )

julu emits particle torso smoke, black smoker as undersea, seabottom, 
depth analysis of deep-sea black smoker interiors, airless response.

julu lives and works on a small square or spit of land attached to 
nothing.

land sucks up everything, land is it.
water sucks up the land. the sea is indefinite, nothing lives there,
nothing visible, not now. perhaps later you might find someone, something, 
take your time. 

it's all confusing. one misstep, and s/he's lost hir bearings. the flat 
sun rises and sets, glaring, subdued. weather might come later.
or a cool breeze.
the sun and moon cast shadows. there must be waxing or waning moons, 
eclipses, crescents. i don't remember any of them.
julu only knows full and emptied sky, no thunderstorms, lightning.
not yet, nothing programmed by lindenlabs.

things might come later.
julu waits for the rain.

julu, pierced


was a bit difficult to set this up and julu had to wear her flight 
bracelet but we (Julu and I) managed to take these aerials from 
around 650 meters up - it might not seem that high, but with the 
use of false perspective we might as well have run up the kilometers.

over and over again, imagining this abject site until i'm exhausted,
julu's exhausted, nikuko's exhausted. this can't go on much farther,
can it. i can jam the site until everything halts, i lose my account,
julu disappears forever. i can slow up things uselessly - you'd have
to return two weeks from now to see any changes. at night my dreams
are distorted, julu doesn't have any, but she's in them. she walks
in fevers like the night. 

daggers, that's what's shooting out. nikuko, blind, the rest of us.

i keep reading about second life, it's something else, not mine; i'm 
waiting for the axe to fall, alan supine, imagine.

starwoman lightwoman Julu


The images that accompany this are probably the most beautiful I've been 
able to create in Second Life, Julu with smokers and projections. Please 
do check them out; if you go to the site, stand by the seawall and turn 
your video on. http://slurl.com/secondlife/Odyssey/48/12/22 - but at least 
(he said whining), check out the pictures! -

http://www.alansondheim.org/ starlight jpg series 


archetype starwoman lightwoman Julu lights up the sky, light furiously 
cascades around her, back home in Brooklyn, it's dark, lights off, it's as 
if the bombs are falling everywhere, as if we're huddled in the dark, net 
down, power off, nothing but these memories, they'll disappear soon. once 
one point I thought memories the most obdurate matter of all, my mother, 
for example, and her world, inconceivably rich, the depth of any other, 
then that, crashing down with her somewhat sudden death, now she resides 
in objects and objects dispersed, the skein is broken, so quickly and so 
corroded.

my own world's time and its historiography, I can't recognize myself, dear 
Julu.  with starwoman lightwoman perhaps something remains, sears itself, 
at least in my mind, there was _that_ image and _that starwoman,_ and my 
mother's voice and for how long. the blacker my depression, unmeasured 
darkworld, the more light separates, bubbles forth, the more the froth of 
the bubbles, the more memory of childhood, a day, for example, on a 
tricycle on a sidewalk, myself rocking back and forth, the green of trees, 
white of cement, black of tricycle.

starwoman lightwoman takes me somewhere else dear God I do not want to see 
myself hear myself, dear God I do not want to live like this forever, not 
even for a year month a week minute second, atom clock hum stopped in 
disbelief at the first and present onslaught of an energized particle from 
distant Julu star, invisible to Julu, out of Julu world and stopping Julu 
breath as well

Confusion


The exhibition arena hall and skysphere are clumped, colluded, coagulated, 
confused, contorted, convoluted, complicated, occluded, obscured, obfu- 
scated, and obstructed - to such an extent that editing at this point 
becomes almost impossible; an editor, myself through Julu or Nikuko (Alan 
Dojoji), literally can't see ahead, with or without mouselook, sufficient- 
ly to isolate and link individual prims. Everything is spewing against or 
towards everything else and the high-speed movement (rotatory, linear, in 
combination) of objects results in jumps from position to position; they 
remain ungraspable. It's also increasingly unclear as to what constitutes 
an object in the first place; particle spews are everywhere, as are alien 
permissions that refuse to be modified.

There are also slow-ups as a result of increasing bandwidth; Second Life - 
in other words my access to the representation of the virtual world - 
almost grinds to a halt at times. Think of over 2000 particles each carry- 
ing a video texture and moving at high-speed from sources that are also 
moving at high speed, among say, 300 three-dimensional and partially 
transparent prims (also moving, etc.), and you get the idea. So there is a 
shift in attention, from proper construction or deconstruction to the 
maintenance, management, and configuration of a miasma which can barely be 
grasped in whole or in part.

I think of this as a form of information implosion where everything gets 
out of hand, or a war or sex zone where it's impossible to walk or think, 
or Pliny's uncle's death (and other devastation) when Vesuvius blew: What 
does one do in such a situation? How does one do it? One false step or 
click and you're underwater or in the skysphere (which is a bit quieter 
than the thirteen channels of sound competing for your attention on the 
ground floor - not to mention video, if you have that turned on as well), 
finding or fighting your way back and to what? - More of the same, an 
incandescent Las Vegas teetering on the brink of the apocalyptic with no 
way out, and possibly no way in for that matter. Because the entrance 
itself shimmers, dances, and roars, and it's easier to fly through the 
melange than to attempt walking or running in - neither may be possible 
from time to time. Then consider this, and what do you do or see when you 
get there? Some things, some prims, moving out of the way, vanishing or 
almost vanishing - it depends on size and location. And for that matter, 
you might not be able to recognize the vanishing at all - there are always 
things coming in to take their place, coming at you, furiously fleeing 
you, or so it seems. The wonder for me, other than the beauty in coagula- 
tion, decay and concentration, is that all of this occurs within a small 
and somewhat stabilized space, a column in a sense, ascending from ocean 
through deconstructed architecture to skysphere - neither above the 
skysphere nor below the ocean nor beneath the ground - anyway - all of 
this occurs in a relatively contained space, and yet seems everywhere, 
everywhen, a concussion of simultaneities which appear self-defining, and 
simultaneously topologically/topographically open ad closed, a machine 
extending from micro- to macro-cosm, and yet doing nothing but high-speed 
processing and representation of scripts that appear to be running amuck, 
but are in fact quite logical from the interior, if in fact there is an 
interior, which is also, in the midst of all this craziness, up and down 
for grabs.

Entering


To get into The Accidental Artist catastrophe site, it's best to fly in. 
At one point years ago, it was possible to access the ground floor by 
taking the front stairs; after these began their slow precession, it 
seemed possible at times to wait, then climb when they were properly 
positioned. Now, everything's different; the stairs are treacherous and 
you might find yourself beneath the ground, drowning without a clue, 
shapes falling, rotating, and shuddering around you, choke choke. Best as 
I said to fly in. At another point months ago, that was easier to do, 
flying ahead across the threshold, entering the space, it's 'turned to 
stone' perhaps or deconstructed, or less treacherous, you could always be 
assured of air. At yet another point weeks ago, better to fly above, how 
high is that, above the space, the walls, the particles, the objects, the 
translucencies, the part-objects, fly above I say, then descend, slowly 
and carefully and to be sure unlosing oneself or winning oneself back, 
unfacing oneself, descend certainly and unsurely, through an artificial 
air that sounds like you're there, somewhere to be sure, the air is cold, 
warm yourself, the air is cold. Then to the colder light and buffeting, 
you might, you will, lose your footing, and I, myself, I can no longer 
edit objects which escape, love to disappear, were told to disappear, 
we're happy, we're not threatened, we're really happy, so much light and 
color! so much sound. I make myself lose myself, Julu said, and I lose you 
too.

i am caught there, cauterized, nothing beneath
the torso, neither to the left nor right am i,
neither above or below, before or behind.
i am only what you see, and how or what you see,
is how i am.

no comment, I've abjured my responsibility. that is to say -
to say what, countered Julu? to say that you talk too much, let pictures
do the talking. 
to counter this Nikuko insisted that responsibility lay in continuing to
provide, provide what? to provide an edge that you lie against or on,
your body almost ready to fall, teetering on the brink beneath which there
are only rocks, or water, or water and rocks at the base of the cliff.
Nikuko insisted that this is about the cliff, there's no rest, no respite, 
nothing but the yaw of the cliff as the point of view changes 
in translation.
the point of view in the featureless landscape, no comment.
no comment in julu or nikuko, they are given nothing to say.

they must be given something to say.
someone must give them something to say.
someone who does not appear in the featureless landscape, no comment.
someone Alan who tenders them, they are spies on the edge of a nervous
breakdown.
they are spies.
Alan lets them loose, they report back, or, no comment, Alan reports
back, their reaction, their place and presence, their signifier, their
name and sign and if lucky, their universal identification number, good
for all encounters.
Alan who owns the virtual world, no comment, Alan has no identification.
Julu and Nikuko carry their identification across the featureless
landscape, carry it in world.
Alan may give them something to say and they are not pleased or 
unpleased to say it, they are only of the saying of it, they are the 
saying of it.
Across the featureless landscape, Alan and Julu and Nikuko, no comment.


Her Master


Julu is uncomfortable with these and I know, in my heart of hearts,
I should be as well. For I would not want to change places with her
for the world. I would not want to be so humble or dependent. It's 
true we're all dependent, but surely there are limits? And this is 
past my limit, outside, so to speak, of my "comfort zone." Yet she 
must be used to these things; she was born with them and most 
likely  will die with them. What am I to do, but continue on? What 
am I to do?

Bvh file behavior collision traced in 'mid-air'


It's four ai/em in the morning, past the dark night of the soul; I am 
ashamed to read fiction, there's so little time left; my neck is in pain, 
my shoulders, those regions beneath the upper jaw, my left leg and foot as 
usual. The greater the dusk, the greater the rush of voices and ignorance 
on my part, not theirs. I work on useless problems - Second Life instead 
of the First for example, or this artificial physics instead of the real, 
concrete world we've been thrown into, our first lack of choice as death 
of course is our last. 

In this Second Life I can at least comprehend since I'm a surgeon here. In 
all this world the cut's the thing, dreams following suit. So I thought 
myself a myth, that of colliding behaviors, Julu for example doing neither 
one thing nor another, but then it seemed... it seemed as if it was just 
that, another myth. So I put it to the test and within Second Life, as 
within the First, of which the Second is but a part or excuse or poor 
actor - within Second Life, as I was saying, a double bind produces - not 
the tension of stasis or sudden and catastrophic collapse to one or 
another mode of behaving, being, because in Second Life, _behaving is 
being_ - but a confusion of behaviors, an army of nodes gone amuck, deep 
distortion of figuration here as nothing is figured out. A fugue state's 
inverted, the body twists and turns - neither organized nor disorganized, 
neither one nor the other, that is to say perhaps the Sheffer stroke - 
Neither A nor B - and that is to say the appearance of the dual - both A 
and B, and yes, the order's non-symmetrical as (A)(B) does not equal (B) 
(A). Isn't this some sort of breakdown, one without the other, not the 
Sheffer, as fossils, remnants, are manifest, and then perhaps the dual? 
This is a mess, it's the mess at work, since Sheffer and dual break down 
here - what emerges isn't synergetic either - just something untoward, 
unpredictable, bordering, but not quite, on the chaotic. What does this 
mean except that if extrapolated to the real we'd have the same type of 
complexity suddenly appearing as in Wolfram's automata - that might be a 
bit close to the real then, the Second melding into the First, as the 
Second, noted above, is already within the First, if not the First 
enveloping the Second. It's confusing, deeply so, inherently so, and the 
evidence is clear in the images below, the clarity of A, the roughness of 
B perhaps and the contamination of each by the other, the irruption of 
confusion in the trails left behind.

I can't think clearly beyond this, only to note that the ability to think 
itself will draw to a close, that soon there will be a dawn and I will be 
blind and thoughtless, and that will be the end of it, confusion as well, 
and I will not be present for that end or the pretense of purity which 
might, for some, follow it, follow suit.

the big clock struck the hour of doom
the small clock struck the hour of gloom
all of us heard the distant boom
as the boom was lowered and the room
shrank plank to plank and the flume
burst in the gloom of a womb
and doom as flooding made a tomb
from the room spurting a plume
of smoke choked and yoked to a fume
from the thunder's womb, va voom, va voom,
va voom, va voom, va voom, va voom.

Damned


When dark and drowned in fountain's red despair
I all alone construct my cast-off state,
I fly in Second Life to my unholy lair
And there rebuilt the world I love to hate -
My home! Absolved, I fly a solid sea,
Search nudes and textures, such frivolity! -
But for good purpose - a place to disappear -
And then to live and die in that good night
One can't walk gentle in; now avatars appear,
Caress and bend their prims in dawn's bleak light.
Please do not run from me; do not fear my eyes
Which glow; they only mirror skies
That split me open, spread me; I turn crust -
Caress my sheaves, fulfill my ruined lust.

Amazing Grounded Universes and Other Phenomena


Some skysphere spaces are interspersed among the objects in the Odyssey 
exhibition space. These spaces revolve slowly, are textured, can trap 
avatars attempting to negotiate them; they carry a mute symbolic which 
goes nowhere, as if it came from nowhere, instead of coming from already 
surfaced textures. But they're relatively enormous, part of the sky; you 
can hardly see Julu Twine living and moving among one of them. Good for 
Julu!

Julu: "These are so cool! In Second Life, where I am and you are too at 
times there for me, the Unwieldy doesn't exist! Something twenty stories 
high moves as quickly as a glove; a building behaves like a ball, a tree 
like a pebble or stone or plate; a tree like a picture, a picture of a 
tree. Everything runs on equal power here; no one gets sick, everyone will 
die, disappear. But for now on the hedge or ledge of things - take a look! 
- miracles occur in utmost safety... "

The New World


Julu Twine on the Asus eee pc 701 exploring Second Life - very small jpgs 
to be sure. What is it you can see? That s/he can ride hir own universes 
in the center of the exhibition space, s/he can add and subtract objects 
within them, s/he's there for us to be sure - Yes! And s/he has become 
once again dual-sexed, creating hir way across these spaces dedicated to 
the new Swiss collider to be sure that may in a very short time destroy 
all of us, but not really - just as the collider brings new phenomena to 
the foreground, fundamental, basic, ground-breaking phenomena, so do these 
tiny universes foreground behaviors that rest uneasy on the ground the 
rest of us walk on; think of Julu Twine as Pioneer of the Virtual, s/he 
explores phenomena we can only dream of, bends protocols to hir Will, 
walks and experiences space-time invisible to the rest of us, perhaps 
someday s/he will write hir memoirs, they will be poor substitutions for 
the real thing, but as close as we can get, closer than we are now: Julu! 
For our sakes! ...

Infinite


Goethe: "Whichever way you look at nature, it is the source of what is 
infinite." (Maxims and Reflections 1409, trans. Stopp.)

Julu: Yes, but of course in Second Life, there is no nature; things can 
only go so high.

Nikuko: Perhaps the idea is one of extrapolation, the asymptotic - one 
imagines going higher, and this is always the case. (Of course there is 
always dimensional collapse - the asymptotic grinding to a halt.)

Julu: Only to an extent - if nothing else the computer itself, client or 
server, carries its own limitations, and these are intrinsic, inherent, 
inherited.

Nikuko: This is responsible for what I consider the _compression_ of Sec- 
ond Life - the uncanny sensation that everything, no matter how distant, 
remains contained, closed in, closing in on itself, closing in on us, 
users and avatars and observers, for that matter.

Julu: And contained along the axis of equivalence or equivalent substance 
(shades of the analogic!), since it is all code, protocol, programming, 
program dynamics; it is all of a one or a two, of a type - one might say, 
following Kripke, of a _natural kind._

Nikuko: Yes, it is a digital substance or floating signifier - and a sub- 
stance with malleable boundaries and internals, but one nonetheless having 
a limit or limits, compression. This is easier to see - witness - than in 
the physical world; inhabiting any virtual world, Second Life or other, 
always has a sense of poverty to it. Where one invests is ultimately in 
the language or culture - inscribing oneself in and out of it, so to 
speak/write/rewrite/presence onself.

Julu: The compression extends metaphorically to a lack of atmosphere - for 
that matter a lack of anything at all (shades of Nagarjuna!); what occurs, 
rides on any number of machines and conduits. As if the world were vacuum 
and emptied even of that.

Julu again: But it's this - I _sense_ it, this compression. In a way it 
seems unnatural, but it's all we have within what is, one way or another, 
a corroded, porous, and dynamic manifold. And it's suffocating.

Nikuko: It's suffocating and wounds; we live within a semantic manifold as 
well, one of permanent wounding. 

Julu: And this is what I meant by _flattening,_ the flat world -

Nikuko: - which extends, seeps out, from the virtual, back into what one 
normally considers the real or Real (literally whatever, here); it is all 
compressed -

Julu: - abjection and defuge at the heart of it.

Nikuko: However one might want to define heart - whatever it is or seems 
to be, it's not infinite.

Julu: The idea of the 'true world' again, coming into play everywhere, 
inscribed or uninscribed.

Nikuko: I can't breath...

Julu: Nor I...

Gearing of the universes


There's other stuff going on here; I don't remember all of it. Most of the 
large objects from duplications of the skysphere are revolving. Later the 
skysphere was revolving and the texture changed again; I didn't want my 
face in the sky anymore, I wanted Yamantaka's. But the image I think are 
fairly amazing now that the sphere and Alan Dojoji, who is Nikuko, are 
interacting. So things are going on in space that are fairly gravity-less, 
in some sort of freefall, although there's an object at the bottom of the 
skysphere which has been there for months and continues to remain in 
place. That seems to have weight. Weight of course is artificial but the 
skysphere appears as a sort of satellite. It's not, but it appears so. And 
if it were a satellite then an object in it wouldn't be free-floating, 
which it's not. Still, it's the only thing like that; the other objects 
float happily, as they do nearer the ground - as do the duplications and 
for that matter remnants of the skyspheres, all within the exhibition 
space proper, although extending upward and into the grounds in front of 
the building, some near the seawall but well above it. That's a feature of 
this particular virtual world, this floating - not to mention what appears 
to be a kind of perpetual, frictionless, energyless, motion of all the 
objects, some of which have been in a kind of hysteria, symptomology, for 
upwards of eleven weeks. Well, the motion isn't perpetual, of course; it's 
the result of client/server activity, protocols, code, programming, 
callups, and so forth. And that is fed from the electric grid, which draws 
on nuclear and coal energy for the most part - the motion, in other words, 
is the result of resource consumption. The energy is relatively miniscule, 
especially compared to the enormous amounts of energy it would take to 
move what seems to be close to a thirty-story apparatus, day and night, 
without monitoring or a caretaker. Of course I'm a caretaker of sorts, but 
I'm out of the space, have always been so. In any case, what you would 
see, should you choose to visit the space, is something even more marvel- 
ous than before, and you'd get to walk or fly around all of this without 
my presence, or anyone else's, no interference here -

Luminism


In the New World of Luminism, video paints and repaints the ocean; 
everywhere turmoil occurs and everywhere the sky is a deeper trouble. 

Luminism of the cataract of Niagara and the eye, sublime mists, mists 
transformed into the commonplace of video texturing, virtual worlds!

For they are manifold and of a Spirit unbounded by code's compression,
the weak evanescence of code, the languor of clouds and rainbows.

Suns, suns!

Beams of light that don't kill birds:  9/11 and fictitious towering

these things last a very short time.

bird-flight in general. And they're back.

Whatever we do, rots from within.

sometimes Julu Twine's nudity is overwhelming.

what is hidden might be menstrual.

what's secreted is the object of desire, abject,

no one knows hir like her handler. so difficult!

what is to be done?

almost; then a vessel is struck, tissue severed from tissue,
and days are needed to restore Julu Twine. here, 
in our other world, under 
a moon full with poisoned air, neither days nor years suffice;
things fall apart, everything falls and fails. memories are
slow to leave, of reds and browns and flowing, and those years
before when many suns whirled the hollow sky. now the ship
arrives, no one is prepared, and seeming worlds sink,
are drawn screaming, past agony; reds and browns flow
furiously, once again, and then no more.

sometimes you move slowly and solemnly towards beauty you have sung

ahm sounding moon, air, pool, song, julu, your place unthere



Moving around gets harder and harder


On the ground floor you may teleport to the ground floor.
You may teleport from the ground floor to the skysphere or ocean inlet.
The ocean inlet is filled with prims with proximity scripts that have
desperately, it seems, tried too get out of the way.
You can hardly find your way there to the two spheres that send you 
back to the surface.
On the surface you can barely find your way to the two spheres that
send you back to the ocean inlet.
Almost everything sends you somewhere else.
Almost everywhere sends you somewhere else.
Almost everywhere may send you almost everywhere, including where you
are, right now.
But to get there, you must enter, and enter everything.
And to enter is almost impossible, as flight is almost impossible;
remnants of skyspheres obstruct your every move.
You might try to fly around the slowly turning skyspheres.
You will most likely be caught in the slowly turning skyspheres.
If you have the proper gift, you can fly directly to the skyspheres.
Flying as such, you will move upwards along a chain of enormous 
remnants of skyspheres, end on end, slowly wheeling in the sky.
You will find you cannot enter the skysphere from below or through the
sides; you must enter through the top, lowering yourself.
You will then stop flying, and walk around the cone penetrating the 
floor, and you will walk with wonder.
You will walk with wonder at the solitude and beauty of the space.
You may touch any of the objects in the skysphere and you will be
transported back to the ground.
Or you may fly out of the top of the skysphere and move away from the 
surface and look back; you will be amazed at the particle
streams and sky-writing that emanates from it.
Or you may fly out of the top of the skysphere, move slightly to the 
sky, and allow yourself to fall beautifully down and into the 
exhibition space, where you will right yourself in order to look about.
Within the exhibition space you will find everything and nothing to
see as your path is obstructed by objects and particles desperate to 
get out of your way.
These objects that are desperate will end up at least in part within 
the ocean inlet which you may have just visited.
There are songs and noise and as you move from one place to another 
within the ocean inlet or exhibition space the songs and noise will 
change.
There is video which streams across and within the streaming particles 
and you may turn the video on and off and the space of the exhibition 
utterly changes.
But you will barely see anything unless you separate your viewpoint 
from the viewpoint of the avatar or set your avatar to mouseview, in 
which case you are tied to the avatar bending
and moved by objects and streams blocking hir path, ascending to hir 
or descending upon hir.
You may find some of those objects sending your avatar down into the 
ocean inlet which you may or may not have already visited.
And you must beware of the trap by the stairs leading into the 
exhibition space, the trap which sends you into a part of the ocean 
inlet from which there is no return, none except for your teleporting 
back to your home space which you may or may not have set, and from 
your home space you may then teleport back into a safer area of the 
exhibition space.
There are so many traps like this, so many distorted and occluded 
views, so many shadows.
And so many shadows and peripheral darkness even in the middle of a 
dark dark day.
So you will walk around or through the shadows which depends on the 
nature of the shadows day or night, whatever time it is in the 
virtual world.
But it's all blooming, buzzing, confusion; it's all wildness that seems 
almost random; it's all bright lights and dimmed space; it's a small 
space you cannot lose; it's a small space that can lose you. 
So you will be careful and your reward will be great, no, greater than 
that, and that with wonder.

Making Boys

   Making Boys

   The very grain of the boy

   .echo the boy

   Great inundation sweeps through the boy

   .echo the boy

   So fun for girls and boys

   .echo the boy

   Salute the boy

   .echo the boy

   Look at the boy

   .echo the boy

   Better make sure of the boy

   .echo the boy

   You're going to change the boy

   .echo the boy

   Put it all around the boy

   .echo the boy

   Time is beginning with the boy

   .echo the boy

   Circles were marked on the boy

   .echo the boy

   Everything's slightly awkward with the boy

   .echo the boy

   Over and over noise pummeled the boy

   .echo the boy

   Over and over noise was added to the boy

   .echo the boy

   Over and over protrusions followed the boy

   .echo the boy

   It was as if the boy

   .echo the boy

   Filters were placed on the boy

   .echo the boy

   You could tell the boy

   .echo the boy

   Six suns orbited the boy

   .echo the boy

   I am the boy

   .echo the boy

   Good and kind for the boy

   .echo the boy

   You're doing a lot for the boy

   .echo the boy

   Not bad at all for the boy

   .echo the boy

   You can hurt yourself, but you don't want to hurt the boy

   .echo the boy

   What talk does to the boy

   .echo the boy

   What talk did to the boy

   .echo the boy

   Bury the boy

   .echo the boy

   The very grain of the boy

   .echo the boy

   .echo the boy

   .echo the boy
