Kewl Hot and Wired


CuSeeMe is the heroin of the Internet. Oh so sweet, milky murky colors
where color is, slow coursing through the veins, eyes drawn back, soft as
ever can be, later coldness and the need for sight again. Oh-oh-sight's an
addiction, impulse, drive of the world, visual or aural, soft candy of the
world, impossible sweetness. Oh, pay a price for the sweetness of the
sweet soft world; hide the sugar chocolate wafers, gauge the price of soft
junkie arms, sweet eyes burned through the bottom of the world's skull. Oh
beautiful skin and sweet soft eyes everywhere on my world. You make them
go on, they'll follow you anywhere, sweet soft world and you and your
world coursing through their veins and always in the background.
