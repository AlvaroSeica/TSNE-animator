hard story thing theory

i started this search just getting ready to eat some space cakes when
hottie walks by the window knock on glass and get her come inside she is
totally cool has a pair of knockers bursting through sweater got talking

out question action loot like nothing at first said no way amount money
offered what did do? offer more groove hangin around favorite tattoo spot
girl town checkin ink going but wanted too expensive told would take then
have enough bite sitting herself newspaper thought might company went over
talk very open having someone join straight into hard story thing if make
few bucks

this is how it happens idea walks into mind and mind follows hungry for 
scent of idea and offers everything can't sleep at night for objet petit a

there is no returning back to mind 

there losing amazing force in continuous display it's not mind fault or

of recovered nhej substrate dna and sequence analysis of distribution of
dna polymerases in archaea, bacteria, eukarya and

true streams were generally characterized by volcanic geology, low grad-

of lgt or ancient paralogy, as not yet appearing to make the f420 cofactor

enzymes with increased substrate specificity. observed in these hyper-

true - the filamentous hyperthermophiles stabilize themselves by attaching
to the substrate surfaces and form the biogenicity of ancient siliceous
hydrothermal archaeons

- true - strongest arguments that these two ancient lineages share inform-

insights into the structure and substrate interactions of the basis for
interpreting the biosignatures for ancient hydrothermal ecosystems and

through the submerged world we are surrounded
within it and the vials open pouring - our
filaments channeled through every cell and membrane
among those macroscopic moments of exaltation
where thought is lost among pheronomic trailings
and bacterial channels harbor lines extruded
and metallic and dimly left behind -
the slough of organism wields uncertain armor -
rusted symbolism lost among archaea -
with no one present [...]  these dark sharings -
immense the span of time and more immense the space
of filigree lost in the wetness of cumbered wounded stars -
