without a sound the rider comes riding
  he's carrying the girl upon his black stallion
  she says father oh father they're gaining upon us
  she says father oh father ride faster ride faster
without a sound the rider goes by
  he's carrying the girl upon his black stallion
  she's screaming father i'm dying father they're gaining
  she's screaming father ride faster i'm dying ride faster
without a sound the rider is gone
  he's carried the girl upon his black stallion
  she's screaming and no one can see or can save her
  she's screaming and no one can hear or can help her
without a sound there's no rider no horse and no child
  in the murmuring forest no girl and no father
  in the murmuring forest no father and girl
