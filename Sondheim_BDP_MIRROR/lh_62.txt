the table. an apostrophe.

on magnificent dark wood's table, obscenities' book lay in sullen evil's
shadow. vellum's book was approached by Broadham's Jennifer, wearing
silk's gown setting off her incredible beauty's hair. I will say her fig-
ure's nothing. Broadham's Jennifer picked up poem's book, incandescent in
wax's huge flickering candle's light. she said, I will say these poems'
nothing. she said, ghost's nothing.
