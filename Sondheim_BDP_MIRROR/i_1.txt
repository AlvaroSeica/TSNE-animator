Carapace





In the middle of the night, in the darkest hours, I am reading Paul 

Feyerabend's  Killing Time, I am working my way through the carapace of 

the book:



this post comes to you like an arrow lost and isolated 

in the nighttime sky. 

it is the loneliest space in the world.

it is fed by its own ego, held with invisible wires suspended

in the invisible air.



[What about the ego? It is encapsulated, governed by packet protocol.  It

is fed by an energy not my own. It thrusts itself into the void. It tra-

vels through wires enough. I cannot follow the course through the earth

itself. It devolves, is shunted, energizes, uses itself up, always in

remission, arrives letter and packet perfect. It is suspended perfectly

and forever. Light loses its speed at either end. In the time it takes to

hold a breath. In the end time.]



it is coming across a photograph that has long-since 

disappeared. the world withdraws into silence.

it is comforting. it does not tally death, voices of amazement

no longer heard.

you turned and looked at me near the stop-sign on the corner. 

and it was black and yellow and you have died only I carry that glance

forever and I will forgive you it 

poised there

in the blank air.



it is always the air. it is the engine of the air or the air-movement 

or the dissolution of the air. it is the air this and the air that and 

it is the dissolution. there is no doubt about the air.



it has no doubt.



"Again I remember only isolated episodes. I can locate some of them, but 

I have no idea where and when the rest occurred. Until about five years 

ago I thought I had been in Kiev; a little checking back and forth 

convinced me that I never left the northern part of the Russian front."

(Feyerabend)



There are myths in the Northwest, a trope of a bridge of arrows, each 

linking to the other, shot perfectly, a conjunction of force, energy, 

vectors, into empty space.
