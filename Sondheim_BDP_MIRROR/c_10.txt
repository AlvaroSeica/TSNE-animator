Oh momma, he is the most beautiful boy you could ever hope to meet. His 

hair is so dark and he seems so strong. And he has a wild look in his 

eyes, but I know he will work hard, momma, because he always has. And you 

know, he is good to me, not like the others. He is always good to me 

brings me presents, why just the other day he brought me flowers and a 

small cake, momma, like the kind the bakery has around the corner. And he 

is going to finish school this fall and set out on his own, and oh I want 

to go with him so badly. He is so beautiful, you would not believe how 

the other girls look at him. He is the smartest boy in the world, and I 

know you will think so to, he is as smart as poppa, and he's so young, 

and he's mine, he's mine! I love him so!



Oh Johnny, she is so wonderful. I can't believe how she looks at me, how 

her eyes say everything in the world and she has them just for me. And 

she has such large breasts, she looks incredible in a sweater, and she 

presses them up against me. I lose my breath when she does this, I can't 

believe how lucky I am. She is so beautiful that everyone turns around on 

the street and when we walk together, I'm so proud. And she's smart, too, 

smarter than anyone I've ever met, the smartest person in the world. I 

know the two of us will go far, there's nothing like it in the world, oh 

I can hardly talk. And her legs are strong too, she walks all the time, 

her hair is long and black just like stars were in it. Every night I 

dream of her, and she's with me night and day. I can't believe she's 

mine, that she has eyes for me alone, that she's really mine! I love her 

so much!
