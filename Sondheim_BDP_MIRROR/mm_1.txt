"I shall expound the phrase avasavattanatthena-anatta. As these flashes of

lightning do not last long and do not possess essence, they will not yield

to one's wishes. Just as it is not proper for one to say that these

flashes of lightning will listen to one's words and that one has control

over them, the physical and mental phenomena contained in the five consti-

tuent groups of existence being impermanent, will not yield to the wishes

of anyone. So it is not proper for one to delusively consider that the

five constituent groups of existence will obey one's orders or that one

has sway over then." (Sammadtthi Dipani, The Manual of Right Views, Ledi

Sayadaw.)

Linguistic annotations to Internet Text file names:



1. Why the sudden change after Net14 ?

2. The alphabet series ends at u .

3. Only five named files: I realized these were already breaking with some 

sort of order - I had to return to a more coherent system.

4. With the dyadic formations, things become confused:

a. Why start with ah, am, an? Where is ai, aj?

b. With the doubles, where is aa? Why does this suddenly break off at jj -

only to start with another series, that of k, after jy?

c. Why does k complete the dyadic series k*, and l complete l*?

d. Where is m* headed?

e. Do kk, ll, and mm replace earlier files related to the doubles series? 

Have texts inadvertently been lost?



I am currently revising my home-page, emphasizing newer work and this 

series - I have no answer whatsoever. My texts tend towards their own 

vagaries and wayward classifications - often beginning as if the whole 

world is ordered, ending, as if everything is in dissolution. In a 

state of depression, both ends transform into substance, through which 

may be read a certain decathected truth; often, however, I write in a 

state of exhilaration...
