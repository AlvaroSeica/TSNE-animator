Sonnet

Jennifer sat down on her frock. She had just read Alexander Graham Pope,
Rape of the Lock. She had written a poem And had to take stock. It was not
nice, about ice, and black winds howling Outside where she died. She knew
it was true but a bad poem because, she Said, it didn't capture the
rapture of the spray in the air there. She Wrote sitting on her frock by
the freighter by the dock. I'm sorry, she Said, but the freighter was
dead. I will be on the Net yet, she said, To her quarry the storm. She
cried and she cried. The ice was nice, the Rain a pain, the wind was
blind, the waves her slaves. She lied most of The time but in rhyme. She
knew it was a very very bad poem. She got up And went home. I'm home, she
said, I'm dead. I know it's so, said Jennifer Me.
