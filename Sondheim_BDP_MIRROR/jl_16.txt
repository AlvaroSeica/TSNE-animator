"Totalitarianism is, in essence, metaphysical; and this, in turn, implies
that every absolute metaphysical position is totalitarian. Yet, is this
not so only because every absolute position posits 'being in totality'
within a representation or 'image of the world'? Consequently, Being is
posited as a simple position, which was precisely Kant's position. And for
this reason (in view of the rise to power of the totalitarian principle
that is unshakable insofar as it is founded upon itself), there is only
one tenable 'position,' which, as it were, may very well be untenable as
a position." (Marc Froment-Meurice, Solitudes, From Rimbaud to Heidegger.)

soldiers of nothing?" (ibid.)

"Soldiers who have no arms with which to hold nothingness and who might
only behold the emptiness as that which renders us free? Between the
fissures and cracks of the (un)armed concrete, the Sea spreads out beyond
our sight." (ibid., immediately following "And thereby accept - once and
for all - to be _unarmed_ and, therefore, soldiers of nothing?" (trans.
