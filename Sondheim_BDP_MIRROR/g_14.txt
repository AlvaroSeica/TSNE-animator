Defuge iv


When it begins to assert itself, draw itself forward like wounded 
Philoctetes, when you begin to notice the nature of its speech, the 
twisted turn of the track on the sand.

But not when you begin to think about the condition of the body, naming 
it Philoctetes, the whole sorry history toppling forward like wounded 
Philoctetes.

When synesthesia spans the sensory modalities, drawing the body forward 
across the registers and intensities of perceptions, when the body dis- 
charges itself in the reception of Philoctetes, when Philoctetes dis- 
charges the body.

When there is no investment in the body, nor disinvestment, Philoctetes 
not-yet-animal, when there is intensity almost bordering on disgust, 
flight from meditation, from speech-Philoctetes.

When fuck-Philoctetes strums, stumbles, Sister-Streaming-Blood, but when 
furrowed sand-inscription, but when swollen, not spelling out. 

Defuge when the repressed returns, crouching, anal spore wet above the 
spurted sands, when the lines break open.

Brou.
