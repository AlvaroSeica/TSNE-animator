  Who am I when I meet you from a distance and the wooden framework
   of the window is already decaying in the rain in the damn rain.
 What can be said when the voices are stilled before they even begin,
	    when the real is a question of packet control.

   The rain falls down.Now there are cacti by the window, which is
 The rain falls down.streaked and the Georgia opuntia lean away from
The rain falls down.the glimmer of grey light. The caulking peels away
The rain falls down.from the thin pane of cheap glass. The white paint
 The rain falls down.peels away from the frame so the pane rattles in
 The rain falls down.the wind until it picks up a resonant frequence,
	The rain falls down.after which it exudes a low moan.

   Thrust of packet.Now the packet moves quickly through the wires,
Thrust of packet.without the coherence of a tangible object; it exists
 Thrust of packet.only in speed or triggering. Coming to rest, outer
 Thrust of packet.layers peel off and the glistening interior remains
   Thrust of packet.as your naked body is reflected in the window,
      Thrust of packet.filtered by cacti and white frame paint.

   The window is what carries the outside of three specific stores
into a cluttered interior as dreary as the covered skylights; dirtied
	     light filters in; you're no longer visible.

	   The packet is that suitcase running lose between
		       Brooklyn and Manhattan;
			four letters fall out:
	      One to a minister praying for forgiveness.
		  One to a doctor begging for drugs.
	       One to a teaching begging for learning.
		    One to no one begging for God.
