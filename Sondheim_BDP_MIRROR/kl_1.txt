Exhibition [1989-1998]


To place myself on exhibition exposes me to sight, perspectival 
containment, the prison-house of language.
This occurs with the greatest degree of narcissism, en-trance 
into otherness and communal discursivities: I'm tagged for the occasion.
The speech is drawn from the exhibited who dwells in a kind of stupor
composed of stuttering and pauses in everyday conversation.
The exhibited procures his or her Nikuko-audience; day in and day out,
this happens as a continuous wager.
Thus everything is given, but this isn't difficult; within the exhibition,
there are few accouterments, and one travels holly-go-lightly.
Traveling so, memory alone remains - something replacing through its brute
inertia, the material world which is denied.
The material world so full of surprises!
The constituted world so full of givens, underlings! (I, myself ...)
I'm awash in the sea of my memories and the spectatorial speech
surrounding, overtaking me.
In the din of the exhibition, it's close to impossible to reconstruct
the origin of language; to construct a language; to hear the first
somnolent sounds of the beginnings of speech, why hello there.
Yet it's within this din that the origins have to be heard, this din,
and the distinction of the other occurring as I descend into the silence
of the vanishing-point of prey.
