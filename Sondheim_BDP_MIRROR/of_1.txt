in the air
out of it

wyoming susquehanna river dike river-side 
 chorus added
thunderstorm front just off the radar

furious light radio astronomy
o angelic orders your streamers descend your streams
steams your stems towards earth of ravished bounty

astronomical astronomy i have yet to hear such beauty
elsewhere as below above not anything

this has moved me to tears, an unabashed recommendation
more fantastic than the visible universe, tremendous praise

and of the worlds thereof
i give you copy of the stars

spectral grit.

in the near future you will hear new sounds
they are coming from the ghosts hovering near the old covered bridge
cows on the hill turned their backs on us
early the electricity failed in large parts of the region
there were violent thunderstorms and near the house, a crackle
the crackle continued at regular intervals
interspersed were the moans, they were murmuring to us
few of them as something jostled for our attention
moan, crackle, moan, crackle, crackle, sometimes a sheet of sound
haunted they were, these hills
haunted the bridge, haunted the dismal brook
haunted the bullfrogs speaking and hearing the moans
hearing the moans by the side of the pond
we were radio radio radio by the side of the pond
we were hearing the moans, we were listening
the radio, we were listening, the aerial and the recording
we were radio radio radio
and the recording of it, the sounds, sooner or later on this site
of the haunting, something moving through the bridge
something there and moving, we were sure of it

anomalous events within a morgantown recording 
very low frequency there are spherics and others
near a covered bridge of which i have already spoken
a farmhouse in the distance

the moans i have already spoken of
are these the ghosts of the dead
i am certain these are the ghosts of the dead

a poverty film of two frames
two flickered images, there are others
i am very sorry

the waif in the garden
who had so much wrong and yet
she still wanted me
because i am an american
and she owns my monies which i have paid
out to everyone but her and you can tell
her clothes are very sorry
but she will be very wealthy 
i will service her breasts on a sunny day
on a cloudy day too

my music is my soul
i am revealing my soul to you

I wanted to capture the grandeur and agony of the landscape!
I have succeeded!

yes yes full of the natural world
we will build next to the mountains
we will make the forests flourish again
they will be better than ever
each tree will have its tiny homeland
with nothing to interfere with its life
yes yes the natural world improves
with every tree the natural world improves

(i feel sorrow for the tiny tree
the last of everything and surviving alone
it speaks to all of those who are lonely
and feeling despair at the mounting world)

thank you, thank you

you're probably tired of these by now
i'm hungry for your (absent) replies
it's hard enough to get myself motivated much less you
i try to respond to work i like mine is unlikeable
 though i work hard at it making it pleasing for you
what it must mean to receive tender commendations
 while we travel across the united states whispering
 every stop through worldwind, thank you nasa
you can meander the highways and the high lonesome places
 where vlf signals blew in from the outer reaches
 and you could follow the world in the world
but you're probably tired of these by now
these tired landscapes repeating themselves over and over again
feeding the hungry is more rewarded than any replies
i'll push myself until i die perhaps not soon enough for you
yes yes i like no i love your work much better than mine
(of work, yours / mine) always speaking is so unpleasant
the tenderness of all interstates and tiny wayfarer's lanes
we are here for you, they signal and nothing utters response
universal plasma is never angelic
but you have listened to every reply with considerable patience

across the street is an electrical substation
beneath the ground there are wires
the building passes wires through brick, steel, and wood
there are radiating pipes everywhere
vlf broadcasting the roar of sixty cycles
machines switch on and off

i played music on a plant
tenderly moving its leaves, the leaves speaking
 in my soft fingers, and for a moment floral murmur
 barely audible, the presence of the oldest world

the choir of the forgotten
 fatal redundancy of all life on earth

of the residue, speaking
of the remnant, fatality

well, the second is a surprise,

the first is a surprise, almost constant chirping
here close to inaudible with post-processing I desired more than anything
even than the presupposition of the chirping so
listen with earphones, all of these require them, you miss everything
without them, and the second, well, this speaks for itself, or rather
the confluence of grounded signalling requiring slowdown, you may feel
you are hearing the world for the first time, this is true, you may feel,
on the other hand, you have already heard too much

one is always encumbered by war in the world
in these moments of peace, listen to the collapse of invisible particles
I render them within the spheres of enlightenment
you are hearing me, you are hearing you

without sun she speaks under the moon of the wood still owing and asks him 
i will service her breasts on a sunny day
We have the start to finish scalpel, rain or sunny, funny?

plenitude fecundity transformations
cornucopia of accumulations
vortex universe of wonder

"for those who still believe"

I'm really happy with this music.
I play it over and over again.

Radio, the World, the Discrete


Not only is radio tremulous in its reception of the stars themselves; it 
is also analogic, requiring no decoding; what you hear, what you record, 
is what there is. The opposite holds for online radio, packet-protocol 
radio, no matter how shipped; like a jpg image, it requires specific 
constructs to make sense of it all. And such constructs tie into very 
notions of software coding, intellectual property, corporate and personal 
privacy. What the antenna registers, what the wires contact, may be 
contacted by all; they are primordial, inert. Give a wavelength or wave- 
length bundle, give a direction or directions or omni-directions, and what 
comes in, comes in to any living creature, ready for the interpretation or 
not, Rosset's idiocy, or the muteness of the world. Move to the Net, Net 
radio, already the raster is at work; there is a fineness, an absolute 
floor and absolute ceiling, of the recording/playback - of the apparatus 
itself - that cannot be bypassed; extrapolation is trusting at best - that 
nothing in-between, no out-of-packet information, exists to trouble the 
rest. This is the differend at work, surely, and it is the differend that 
characterizes the digital - what is not permitted to speak, what is 
literally circumlocuted.

Radio brings the unknown to bear; the Net brings the known to the 
bearable. Given a text/image/audio/whatever file - that is all there is, 
nothing more; it exhausts itself and is exhausted and the play of content, 
the semiosis, exists in the perceiver, not 'out there.' This is secondary 
narcissism, looping through the machine; primary narcissism is the realm 
of the analogic, our cosmological identification.
