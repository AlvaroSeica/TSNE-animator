Parable


I, Daishin Nikuko, write this so you will be saved. I give everything,
my best dress, my stockings, my undergarments, for your salvation. I
walk across the path of righteousness, not along it; I gird your way
for you, protect you. You will meet my double on the path. Do not
deviate from the path. Do not listen to the words of the avatar. How
will you know the avatar. You will know the avatar because she will
offer her nakedness. She will walk orthogonally in relation to the
vector of the path. She will command you to obey the vector. She will
order you not to follow the avatar.

I, Daishin Nikuko, have all the time in the world and I won't give you
any of it. Take off your clothes, says Daishin Nikuko.
