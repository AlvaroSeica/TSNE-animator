Continuation of the Above


Sometimes the simplest things go unnoticed in the midst of the world.

Everything always happens all at once. There can be a small thing and
within it there might be another thing or part of the same thing or some-
thing indiscernible from the small thing. And all of these things happen
too. And everything happens and all at once and all the time. Nothing can
not happen. "The phrase 'is true' may be considered to express the identi-
ty function, since to assert _p_ is equivalent to asserting that _p_ is
true." (Dictionary of Symbols of Mathematical Logic, Feys and Fitch.)

In the world of the virtual, on the plane of constituted bodies, things
sleep until they are awakened. Someone or something does the awakening and
they they may happen. They are things that do not happen all at once. That
is so simple we tend to forget about it and they tend to forget about it -
if the things that are happening all at once could think and forget, and
if the things that sleep and do not happen until they are awakened, could
think and forget. And even if those last things could think and forget,
they may not know when they are about to sleep or about to wake. Or they
may know these things, which are of the real and the virtual, just as the
real is of the virtual, and the virtual is of the real.

They are all open to happening.
