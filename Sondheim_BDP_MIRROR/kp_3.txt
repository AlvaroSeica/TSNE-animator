[This is a site map. Mosaic 3 also does session reports, mapping the links
and their relationship vis-a-vis an active session. While the site map is
spatial - static site links - the session report is temporal - traveled
links and their relationships vis-a-vis the travel. The site map is ideal
cartography; the session report is cranial, half of the (virtual) subject/
user, half of embedded and traveled routes. Think of the session report as
vectored and the site map as connected. Years ago I developed the concept
of dual orders, the definable (site map) and the immersive (session re-
port); each could embed the other. The immersive order was time-dependent
and subjectivity was complicit; the definable order was diagrammatic and
topology was implicit. Now I see both orders weaving through Mosaic 3,
part of the postmodern geography of cyberspace (such as it becomes). And
on a technical note, these presentations are far more sophisticated than
those of current (state of the art) browsers; like the traceroute command,
they're useful in situating the user, part of Cyber-GPS (global position-
ing system.)]
