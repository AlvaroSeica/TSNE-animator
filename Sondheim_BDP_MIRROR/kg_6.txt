It might be the case that this half, which I write now, is preparation
for the second, on memory, which has already been forgotten - this
half, written on-line, on the machine itself, and the second half, wri-
tten once beforehand, stored on the laptop which now presents this
virtual machine, that is, for example, the construction of this half as
if it were on the laptop, not on a Unix box somewhere in New York City,
as this long-winded sentence might make clear.

So that there would be a following text, after this broken introduction
to a series of paragraphs I don't remember all that well, but having
something to do with, something on the order of, the spider - which in
this case must be a broken web, machinic, across the line which divides
this section from the other.

-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -

I wanted to write through the path by the store and Hakozaki, but I
could not put my finger on it. I could not touch the flesh that makes
this difference, which is only held by the thinnest of threads, that of
the community of spiders-without-intelligence.

I could not go on from here, from there. I could not move across your
room, my room. There are eight corners of the cube to hide in. I will be
in one of them, or an other. I will be an other.

I will be one of the community of spiders. Memory has no residence. I
would be taught that. I would be taught that signs are absent. I would
be taught about address.

What I am trying to say here does not depend on anything that has come
before, that is, anything I will have read or written. It is broken off,
just as if it were a memory.
