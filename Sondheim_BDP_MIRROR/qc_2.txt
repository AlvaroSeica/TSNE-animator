I've been following this discussion and thought the best way I might 
participate is to describe the work that I've done with Foofwa d'Imobilite 
and others over the past decade or so. We went from using video and audio 
tracks accompanying choreography, to work in Blender and Poser. The Poser 
work was created from bvh (Bio-Vision Hierarchy) files produced with 
motion capture (mocap) equipment that used 21 sensors electromagnetically 
interacting with an antenna. The antenna fed sensor signals into a hard- 
wired 486 microprocessor that output coordinates; these were fed into a 
second computer that created the bvh files themselves. we modified the 
sensors in a number of ways - some through the software interface, and 
some with limb assignment and position. We did a piece called heap for 
example - the sensors were dropped in a heap and the bvh file fed into 
Poser. We did a star piece, arranging the sensors in a star formation on 
the floor and inverting it by exchanging +r from a sensor position to -r. 
We also reassigned sensors in several ways - dividing them between two 
bodies, remapping inversely onto a single body, and so forth. All of this 
produced bvh/Poser mannequins that were used as projections in live per- 
formance, or chroma-keyed over dance/performance video.

All of this work was at West Virginia University's Virtual Environments 
Lab, headed by Frances van Scoy. I received an NSF consultancy through 
Sandy Baldwin and NYSCA grant; through the former, I had a grad assistant 
from software engineering, Gary Manes, to assist me. We went into the 
mocap software itself and Gary rewrote it, creating a dynamic/behavioral 
filter interface, which would produce transforms from the sensor output - 
before the 3-d assignment to bvh was made. This was modeled on graphic 
software filtering, but the assignments were different - we applied a 
function f(x) to the coordinates and/or modified the coordinate mechanism 
or input streams themselves. The bvh files that were produced were sent 
into Poser for editing; in some cases, Poser mannequin video was output. 
But more and more, we edited in Poser to format the bvh for upload to 
Second Life; this way we had live 3-d performance based on the transforms. 
This performance could interact within Second Life itself - with other 
online performers and audience - or through projection, without Second 
Life, in real-space where performers might interact with the avatars.

The bvh files are complex and avatars perform, most often at high-speed, 
with sudden jumps and motions that involve them intersecting with them- 
selves. The motions appeared convulsive and sometimes sexualized. Foofwa 
d'Imobilite used projects direct from Poser - about 100 files - as part of 
Incidences, a piece produced in Geneva and widely shown. Foofwa, along 
with Maud Liardon and my partner, Azure Carter, also imitated avatar move- 
ment - and this fed back, from dance/performance into programming and pro- 
cessing; at times it has been impossible to tell whether a particular 
motion stream originated on- or off-line.

I've always been interested in the psychoanalytics of dance/performance, 
beginning with Acconci's and Anderson's early work years ago. With Sl/ 
live performance, we've been able to explore these things - particularly 
issues of abjection and discomfort, sexuality/body/language - directly. 
Two other modes of representation have been of great use - modified 3-d 
scanner modeling programs (also from the WVU VEL), and Blender assign- 
ment, for example, of metaballs to nodes; using both of these, we've been 
able to create avatars that have no relation to the body whatsoever, but 
whose movement is impelled by mocap files. These appear almost like dream 
objects undergoing continuous transform.

In SL, everything is pure, digital, protocol, numeric; by 'smearing' the 
animation input, avatar appearance, and location, we create in-world and 
out-world experiences that stray from body and tend towards choratic and 
pre-linguistic drives. We've performed a lot at various limits of SL - on 
sim edges for example, or at 4k 'up', where the physics changes. The 
output is the usual - audience in-world or out-world, as well as video and 
stills. I've had great help in SL programming, and Sugar Seville gave me a 
very large gallery/museum space to experiment with these things - this was 
from June 08 until March 09. I created complex performance spaces that 
were literally impossible to navigate; for both audience and performer, 
everything was negotiation. The results of this work can be best seen in 
my files at http://www.alansondheim.org/ or at http://odysseyart.ning.com 
or through Foofwa's site http://www.foofwa.com .

Foofwa, Maud, Azure, and myself all traveled to the Alps where avatar work 
was re-enacted live; the performances were on the edge of the Aletsch 
glacier. (This was sponsored by a Swiss grant.) What was interesting most 
to me here was the development and performance of a field - Foofwa dancing 
with a VLF (very low frequency) radio antenna, for example - his body 
coupled and modified the electromagnetic capacitance surrounding the wire. 
We had done this indoors with Foofwa and Azure; outdoors, against the 
glacier, spherics formed a deep part of the content. This also paralleled 
work we did with the mocap sensors at WVU - using high-strength magnetics, 
we modified the local fieldlines, almost as if we were modeling general 
relativity's 4-space gravity/mass interaction - the results were similar. 
I'm fascinated by these 'cosmologies in the small'; at the same time, want 
to avoid any easy and false metaphoric equivalence with scientific theory. 
As for the theory of the work we're doing, at least from a phenomenologi- 
cal viewpoint, I've put up http://www.alansondheim.org/sltheory.txt which 
has also been published as a book.

At the moment I'm working with sim overload and self-reflexivity: on a 
simple and neat level, what if a performing avatar connects to an object 
('prim' complex) designed to move away from hir? The result is a total 
[avatar/complex] that flees indefinitely - at least until the complex goes 
out of world.

Ukulele mapping onto bass lines: psychoacoustics of projected mass.

http://www.alansondheim.org/ukubass1.mp3
== playing fast bass-lines on uke. This was almost impossible to do, 
since the uke resonance dominated.

http://www.alansondheim.org/ukubass2.mp3
== attempting the same through a song format. The result is more 
"bass-like" but has the same lumbering quality.

== This and the following originate from the same ukulele file - but 
with different ukulele/quarter ukulele mixes. The projected mass is
completely different as well.

My Father's 95th birthday and why I might not be up to par for a while.

My father's birthday started out with Azure and myself taking a 20-year- 
old Accura in to get a tailpipe replaced and reset after I backed the car 
into a curb yesterday. I still have no proper eyeglasses and was nervous 
after difficulties with the family over my father - we're in Pennsylvania 
helping him, along with my nephew and his partner, since he had a pace- 
maker put in on April 20 when his heartbeat dropped to 38. Ok, we ate at 
Denny's waiting for the car, got the car, went back home, and I lay down 
to take a nap - we were returning to Brooklyn this afternoon. About ten 
minutes later I was wakened by Azure who said there was smoke in the 
house. we couldn't find the source. I went down into the basement and 
found a fire in one of the rooms - furniture burning, specifically beds. 
Azure and Amie got my father out of the house (which was decorated for his 
birthday) and onto a lawnchair in front. I screamed for water, ran 
upstairs and found some tonic which I threw on the fire - the flames, 
about two feet high - were too much for it. So Dan and Azure started 
bringing water down to me and in about twenty minutes to a half hour I had 
the fire out, dizzy from smoke which filled the house. I found a sink in 
the basement that made filling the pots we used a lot easier. The firemen 
arrived and I convinced them not to use their hoses - I was still pouring 
water on the fire. They didn't and we left the house. I returned to the 
house and met the firechief who told me someone had been smoking in the 
basement. No one smoked so we realized someone had broken in. After the 
firemen left we looked around, found no one, called the police and a 
locksmith. The police had no idea what happened and the locksmith 
installed a very heavy deadbolt on the basement door and left. Azure tried 
the deadbolt and it broke internally and the locksmith returned. The cat - 
Katski, my father's companion for nine years - had run out of the house 
and to this point hasn't returned. We looked all over for the cat. We 
locked up the house and opened everything to let the smoke out. Neighbors 
came over. Tonight a circuit breaker turned part of the house dark. We 
have no idea what set it off. We have had three ghost cat sightings in the 
house but no cat and nowhere to hide we haven't looked. My father is 
distraught. We got all the burned furniture out on the back terrace. Azure 
is distraught. We have to figure out what really caused the fire, who 
might have broken in, was it deliberate, we don't think so, we didn't even 
hear anyone in the house at all. We have to have an electrician come to 
give us some idea if the circuitry had anything to do with it. Other than 
the furniture we managed to save everything and clean the place up. It's 
odd to think I saved my father's life given our horrendous relationship 
over the years. I'm the damaged oldest child of three sib- lings. I 
negotiate as much as I can with my brother and sister, my brother 
negotiates with my sister, my sister talks to my father, my brother and I 
try to talk to my father. The house is now under lock and key and Azure 
and I keep going out looking for the cat. Sandy, I'll be on tomorrow; 
Foofwa, I'm going to try and get the grants done; Myk, please let me know 
what night i can call you. I have problems seeing which didn't affect the 
ukulele pieces since I really don't need vision for that. I'm neglecting 
Second Life for a bit. I apologize to everyone for being out of 
commission, I seem to live from crisis to crisis, should not be down here 
so soon after eye surgery for example. Please if you need a response from 
me, be a little patient. I can't see straight and tomorrow the problems 
we're sure will start all over again. We're going to return to Brooklyn on 
Monday if we can.

The really sad things, the cat is gone, my father close to tears, and the 
house all decorated by my nephew and his girlfriend for a nice 95th birth- 
day party. He was getting better and better after the surgery (there were 
complications) but now is repeated a lot more, ever since the cat ran out 
of the house...

firm and meant

having been given the locus solus of a place empyrean within the firmament 
surely to establish basecamp manipulations, here are initial setup results 
which spew yes as usual but provide dance/performance e-poetry poetics 
platform for future digressions, no matter how small or large fractioned, 
at least for momentary production overflowing buffer and boundary alike. 
these construct entrapment modules within which permitted dance/perform- 
ance are necessarily displayed until avatar walks away, yawns, gets ready 
for another emission-mototron. how trapped one is! a cage of one's own 
protocols repeated uselessly as we have shown these many hours. behaviors 
align within the wisdom of the old which rumbles tumbles along. this is a 
continuous transfiguration always returning to the ghost of an origin 
"sitting alone on a couch, reading and visible to a neighbor peering 
through the foggy windows." an avatar in a virtual world controlled surely 
by an avatar in a virtual world. avatar thought is always "caught and 
bought." here things jump around the platform which seems to exhale, but 
nothing very serious. aren't we all tried of psychogeography, don't we all 
wish that something would, once and for all, break? if i'm not careful 
we'll be that thing, the dance of the 'royal-we.'

my head explodes like this and i can't get enough of it, there's never 
enough of it, it's always falling down the edges, escaping from the 
horizon, there's got to be more of it, it's got to come from somewhere, 
i'm dreaming precisely this - that it's coming from somewhere, you know 
where that somewhere is, you know what it's good for, it's good for 
nothing, you know that's the truth, nothing whatsoever, it's good for 
nothing whatsoever.

Thanks to Hans Brandeis, I was able (more or less) to repair the Philip- 
pine boat lute, which most likely is a T'boli hegelung. I added three 
frets and a fine-tuning mechanism, and Azure attached the tassel. I 
changed one of the two strings to a b/h and tuned the drone an octave 
lower. Finally we found a matching mirror for one missing, and I waxed the 
body. I placed the frets according to harmonics, keeping the lower four 
(including the 'zero' fret, which acts as the nut for the playing string) 
more or less in the position they came in. The replacement frets were made 
from beeswax and bamboo; Azure painted them, since black beeswax wasn't 
available. In any case here are some images of the (somewhat) restored 
instrument, as well as two pieces, the second based on a riff of the 
first.


Another round


This time, the frets were moved, following Brandeis' measurement of a 
T'boli Hegelung in the field, and the two strings were in unison. 
Musically, I'm fond of these more than the others (which have been 
removed) - hope you like them. - Alan

Froth


When I went through my collected writing in the Internet Text for a 
forthcoming book, I found far too many of the pieces were depressive, 
almost suicidal in nature. The irreconcilable logic of the family leaked 
into a theoretical that would have been, by far, the better had it been 
purified; I look towards Carnap, Wittgenstein, Jabes, rather than Lingis 
or Freud. Lacan took refuge in distorted mathesis; I tend towards the 
diagram below/elsewhere, another leakage from power into the register of 
cleansed perception; when dirt enters the eye, vision suffers, but not 
within the aegis of dirt.

Below: Filth is hammered among polarities.

Of course pama-mapa is certainly a case of entanglement, strings attached.
The Other continues an afterimage. Just an afterimage.

There is always a blankness, flatness, to the image. The real is already 
flattened at the horizon/on the horizon: 

The real is the horizon.

{ Appearances: falling into the real.
( The inextricable alienness of the world: non-Aristotelian.
{ Dasein.

Someday a post-phenomenologist will begin with the human and devolve, 
backed up against particles, replete with awkward metaphors.

{ As if particles were generated by organism.
{ As if scales implied hierarchies and emergence.
{ Think of submergence, details lost per particle, recuperated in the
{ irretrievable ensemble.

{ Our humanities: struggling with bad metaphors.

For cause skims the surface of froth, organization is the masquerade of 
afterthought.

{ We bring masquerade to the masquerade of the world.

{ Instead of nothing, so many things for so short a space and time.
{ We have no concept of their persuasion.

{ Of persuasion, anyone; of concept, none.

World

String theory knocks a loop into analog/digital, nothing remains certain 
that is one way or another, what occurs can be read accordingly pre/sent 
or sent/from. Holographic theory knocks a loop into ding-an-sich, / Ding 
an sich Ding an sich is unknowable though certainly /: The roads to the 
visible real are tortured, one can't say anything. This is the dead-end of 
philosophy, with the exception of the social - you have justice and ethics 
beneath the aegis of situational heuristics, but one ultimately appeals at 
best to primatology without teleology or theology. What happens to the 
episteme, epistemology, around the circuits of a black hole? The ontology 
of strings and information scattered (presented, coded, irretrievable) 
might as well devolve into mathesis where ideality itself is problematic: 
At the end of the day, nothing remains, but everything is present; nothing 
is everything, and so forth. The broken ontology of the middle way is 
broken in another and more radical way: Nothing can be said, because what 
there is, is literally unsayable. Try translating equation into language, 
language into everyday doxa, dark matter into descriptors, descriptors 
into primitives, primitives into foundations. Give it a go: That the movie 
we watch is ourselves watching the movie, that projection is sourceless, 
that every four vector carries the potential of an imaginary. There's no 
'it' to go farther than this: We are the dream-screen of an unconscious 
universe, no matter how far, how many conventions, dimensions. Convention: 
What we call as a past posterior. Accountability: Unaccountability. It's 
the knife-edge of good things in catastrophe theory transmuted through 
classicism into the anthropic principle, mythos of origins. Cause and 
effect: Scattered. Hallucinated projections named 'real' by hallucinated 
projections. The buildup of dimensions, topologies, branes, dark-matter, 
virtualities: No buildup at all, the baroque edifice of something given 
meaning by something naming by some fantasm or an other. Membrane/brane 
among Planck's lengths, masses, times, embedded seethed or froths as if 
non-embedded. You can always: Add, subtend, augment, the pressure of 
mathesis, eventually loose consistencies, heuristics, seem to dominate: 
The four-color theorem as example. What of this? In the small: Classical 
logics, set theories, Ptolemy and Kepler: Reductions because math can do 
that. Divide and spread, emit, spew, sourceless, targetless, broiling, 
then what might be phenomenologies of coagulations: Maybe Wolfram's 
automata giving shrift to these, cells falling apart, failing, location- 
less. So we're: Present and accounted for as-if 'among us': Therefore a 
literary as if 'object and process' or one or another ontology, creaky but 
functional epistemologies: As long as the hallucinogenic withdraws, 
'doesn't look too close,' as if 'there were looking,' as if 'there were a 
ground of one sort or another,' of which: None of these, they're knot.

World ii

Fields appear to have no touch, nothing germane to the body; one thinks of 
action at a distance because distance seems emptied. Heat transgresses for 
example; nothing happens in mediated space. Magnetism implies qualitative 
distinction; the field attracts or repels, depending on polarity and just 
what is brought into the vicinity. An approach may be +/0/-; two out of 
three attract. Epistemologically, ontologically, difference is drawn out - 
here is something out of the ordinary, perhaps non-Aristotelian, who 
knows? In any case, it's neither 'spirit' nor a thing of the world, 
although clearly it is of the world, within the world, part and parcel of 
the real. No hands push or pull the metal; were it not so common, it would 
be miracle, but it seems to 'come along with' everything familiar. Even 
boundary is contradicted, and one might be sure that the attractive 
impulse, presence, is there, even in the absence of the Other. It just 
_is._ This should, except for that familiarity, already have signaled a 
break, bringing the edifice of thing and logic down. How is space and time 
- how is space-time - when something so common is there that is not within 
as an object is within, that is not graspable, except by effect? Energy 
already seems something other than the world's thinging, yet just as 
concrete. It's not far from these considerations to an aporia of three- 
dimensionality, not to mention mass, image, light, heat, all those spatial 
fillings that seem neither possessed of projection or ordinary physical- 
ity. The clues are there, have been there. Yet again, the dream is an 
Other whose ontology isn't simply a mapping for or against a real (which, 
yes, might be the dream itself) - we're back where we startled from, 
making harmony and fit where none exists in the life-world, where bridges 
are ad-hoc at best, still taking on the characteristics of extensions and 
truth. Then there's dirt, filth; I remember Socrates' bypassing mud as 
ideality - already a fly in the ointment. What simmers beneath the surface 
isn't just abjection; it's also froth, roil, wisp, membrane, magma, clay, 
plasma, species productions and particle rains. And it's here that the 
dissolution of things is the clearest, that humans are capable of tempor- 
arily reining-in, a momentary act of meaning-generation. Yet we're invaded 
by our knowledge; our projection bodies are processing, in the process of, 
corrosion, of being-vanquished, of always already disappearance of memory 
and noise. When lines are drawn, analog/digital, they're dependent on an 
alien phenomenology of potential wells: Existence is always bypassed, and 
bypassing characterizes existence. Fielding and being slough and incohere; 
to be sure there are formings and swarmings and no one can say much more.
