arms among arms, surrounding breasts, plateaus turned, curled inward,
i'd think nothing, just as the fingers curled at night, body-memories
of of of of of
>
infants, embryonic suturing, curled hands and moving, touching all of,
oh i'd envelop you, oh so safe and surrounded
and and and and and
>
deepest ever, sleepy eyes wide open, suffused and slow closings, 
murmured sounds, mufflings in same time zones, same times and spaces
o o o o o
>
blurred visions and eyes of pure light and dark, shadows and muted
whisperings, open filters and editors, rounded edges, shufflings,
scufflings, frayed, filigreed, curled arms around you, fingers curled
in all our holes
and and and and and
>
time zones, time hurrying home, all of a hurry, all of a wonder,
we are born into return, our skin dries out of doors, hardens,
scales, our molecules crawling
of of of of of
>
less than that hard sounds, flooding of pulse and body memories
and and and and and
