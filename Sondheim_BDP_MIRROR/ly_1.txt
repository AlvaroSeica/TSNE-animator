my heart throbs for you
you sail the uncharted seas of distant lands and bleak horizons
you move through mountains and valleys and the darkest forests
my heart yearns for you, my eyes cry for you
your love follows you in your beauty and your long flowing tresses
your love follows your long golden hair and your eyes of deepest blue
my arms dream of you, my legs take me towards you
"for i will follow you until the ends of earth and time
"for i will walk behind thee until mountains fall and valleys rise
my heart, my heart, my eyes, my arms, my legs
your golden voice, the pause in the middle of a word, eyes wide open
eyes wide open and open wider, and eyes wider open, and open wider
my heart throbs for you
"for i dream of you and think of you, your voice whispering on the wind
"for your beauty is deeper than the ocean and your eyes bluer than the sky
my arms long to hold you in my arms, my legs yearn to hold you in my legs
your eyes wide open, your eyes open wider
my heart yearns for you, my crying open eyes

Netsex & Various

Cybermind Conference 1996, unedited MOO log ("Alan" is a proxy; we stood 
in for each other, transformed each other's texts; I was the "Speaker" for 
this event) - Alan

Martin says, "we're close to beginning here..." 
bree has disconnected. 
Martin says, "What I would like is a discussion behind me on the screen 
dealing with netsex, and I may be able to interact - I'll let you know 
when - you don't need to talk at all about this if you don't want, but it 
would add/resonate w/ the presen- tation which is going to be pretty 
chaotic." 
Raxcip says, "sure, I will listen and play." 
A very large pelican scoops bree up in its enormous beak and flies off to 
drop her in bed. 
Dria says, "um...I'll add stuff If I have anything to say (I usually do 
;)" 
Ghost nods. 
Martin says, "stay on here - going off for about 30 seconds... - please 
stay on" 
Ghost says, "Standing by.." 
Martin asks, "hello?" 
Martin sighs. 
Martin cheers wildly. 
Ghost smirks. 
Dria does a little dance 
Ghost stomps a rhythm 
Raxcip asks, "just a cyber-type observation...  Does anyone else find it 
odd how easy it is to tell Alan from martin, even though they are sharing 
a name?" 
Alan has @joined you. 
Raxcip says, "Welcome, Alan." 
Dria says, "Personalities come across really well, I find.  Esp. if the 
person can write." 
Alan says, "Im on as Alan now - and I think that Martin is on the other 
screen..." 
Alan says, "Please hang in there..." 
Raxcip says, "yes, I suppose." 
Dria says, "hanging." 
Raxcip says, "on" 
Ghost says, "there." 
Dria says, "stage fright :>" 
Apocryphal says, "indeed, Dria..." 
Dria says, "ah...I should get a gin&amp;tonic." 
Raxcip cracks open a beer... 
Dria says, "brb" 
Apocryphal puffs on a mellow cigar 
Alan says, "Okay we're on - " 
Martin reconnects. 
Alan says, "Richard MacKinnon is going to type for me --" 
Martin exclaims, "Whee!" 
Dria laughs 
Martin exclaims, "I can do the minutes here!" 
Raxcip says, "it only seems like minutes..  Its hours." 
Alan says, "Alan wants a minute by minute countdown." 
Dria says, "okay, you're hired ;)" 
Alan says, "Alan wants us to discuss what netsex might be." 
Ghost drops its drawers.. 
Raxcip says, "I thouth we were byond *that* point..." 
Martin says, "Alan went to "Hot Horny Bitches" because someone asked him 
to" 
Alan asks, "What do you mean Raxcip?" 
Ghost asks, "Not stimulating enough here?" 
Dria says, "Well, the mind is the most important sexual organ.  Take away 
all the other senses, and those which remain are heightened.  That's what 
it's all about. :)" 
Raxcip says, "the general definition.." 
Alan exclaims, "Hey Martin I didn't realize that you were here!" 
Martin says, "Alan is talking about "wryting" as the ontological 
component 
to writing ..." 
Martin says, "Well now you do .." 
Martin says, "We can take turns transcribing Alan ..." 
Martin exclaims, "Netsex sounds ....  aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh    
zzzzzzzzzzz m mmmmmmmmmm m m mm m m m  erghhhhh   h h wheeeeee!" 
Dria laughs 
zone has entered Conference Room. 
Alan asks, "Dria . . . are you saying that mind-impoverished beings 
cannot 
have sex?" 
Martin says, "oog" 
zone laughs 
Dria says, "I find the silences during are more expressive :)" 
zone loves it 
Ghost exclaims, "Oh baby!" 
Dria says, "mind-impoverished?  Uhm...yes, I guess I am." 
Dria says, "depends what that means, of course" 
zone cracks up 
Alan says, "Dria, well then it seems to me that one doesn't need much of 
a 
mind to be silent.  Perhaps you should consider hooking up with a rock." 
Martin says, "Alan is talkig about hesiataions and backtracking and 
erasuresd ..." 
Raxcip says, "Yes, Its interesting to think of the other when there not 
typing..." 
Alan says, "Oh I see . . . then it's not the *silence* which is poignant, 
but the thoughts resulting from the silence." 
Speaker fades in from Entry Point and joins you. 
Ghost says, "writing Alan talking about writing erasures.." 
Speaker says, "I'll be Alan's words ..." 
Speaker says, "Martin typing them ..." 
Martin says, "yeah" 
Raxcip says, "or, the silences translate to RL " 
Dria says, "typing takes a certain concentration...if you're otherwise 
occupied, it becomes secondary :)" 
Speaker says, "One case which resulted in netsex that recuperated a 
married woman ..." 
Ghost says, "Good argument for CUseeme.." 
Alan says, "That's interesting.  Fanny, mentioned to me that the VR 
impressions made on her--particularly the romantic kind--seem to linger 
into the real world." 
zone manifests a spontaneously generated tatoo on her inner arm which 
reads: words are sex 
Martin says, "Sounds being recorded ... we'll put up the realaudio up 
later ..." 
Dria says, "excellent argument for CUseeme...but that changes the 
situation, really.  It's not as much connected to mind...it becomes also 
visual." 
Alan says, "Of course, this "lingering" phenomenon is often characterized 
by silence, especially when a person has logged off." 
Speaker says, "At times netsex can be completely overwhelming ... " 
Goatium_Guest fades in from Entry Point and joins you. 
Speaker says, "Part of it the 'command structure'  ..." 
Ghost moans 
Speaker says, "The ASCII unconcoous ..." 
Speaker says, "ignore my spelling" 
Alan asks, "If the mind is the primary sexual organ, then what is the 
difference between net.sex and physical sex?" 
zone smiles 
Dria says, "raw, digitized self, expressed.  It's very different." 
Speaker says, ""I can't type half as fast as Alan, even though I do it 
for 
a living ..." 
Raxcip says, "net.sex leaves you alone, untouched." 
Alan says, "Hmmm....this implies that a virtual body is available to 
virtual lovers." 
Dria says, "untrue...emotions are of mind...I can be 'touched' 
emotionally...often with greater effect." 
Goatium_Guest has disconnected. 
The housekeeper arrives to remove Goatium_Guest. 
Speaker says, "text emerges as parts of past, childhood ... interjections 
... snatches that are not normally given voice to ..." 
Dria says, "it's a more intellecutal intercourse." 
Raxcip says, "Yes, but I decided I could no longer have netsex.  it left 
me feeling too alone, too sad." 
Alan says, "Yes, but even your desire to use the wor....er...word 
"touched" implies that a sort of "body" is produced-- whether emotional 
or 
textual." 
Speaker says, ""Part objects .." 
zone . o O (...duly noted use of the word "snatch") 
Dria says, "it's not a replacement, but an enhancement" 
Martin says, "Snatch was my word .." 
zone . o O (...duly noted use of the word "intercourse") 
Martin apologises. 
zone laughs 
Dria did that on purpose ;> 
zone nods to Dria 
Alan says, "Yep.  I think's that's true to a point...but it's even more 
than an enhancement.  I think it is an alterate, but not necessarily one 
that replaces." 
Martin catches the odd drop from Alan's verbal waterfall ... 
zone smiles at Martin 
zone loves it 
Alan hands Martin a bucket 
Speaker says, """The power of Netsex ... not trivial ..." 
Speaker says, "Joining subjects across the wall of language .." 
Speaker says, "defining ... truth ... idea of true speech and the genuine 
other .." 
Speaker says, "primordial objectivity ... " 
Alan asks, "Dria, you said that you think the "touching" in VR is an 
enhancement of physical touching.  This implies that the former is better 
than the latter.  Do you really believe this?" 
Dria says, "netsex allows us to explore, to investigate, to 
experiment...with only minor risk, compared to rl...it's a new form of 
fulfillment...we are only beginning to explore the possiblities" 
Speaker says, "kant ..." 
Speaker says, "Questions about Kant ..." 
Martin exclaims, "Bucket!?!?!" 
Alan asks, "What's a matter, Martin?  Is a bucket not large enough to 
catch drops from Alan's waterfall?" 
Dria says, "enhancement...not 'better', just...different...often 
'worse'...but it's something new, and powerful, which affects profoundly 
the lives of many people.  It cannot be shrugged off as inconsequential" 
Speaker says, "A state of primitive fusion and confusion .." 
Speaker says, "Temptation of St Antoine .." 
Ghost says, "No one's mentioned gender yet.." 
Speaker says, "Cyberspatial buzzing .... huge amounts of ..." 
Speaker says, "Excretion's featured a few times ... not that zone ..." 
Speaker says, "not = note" 
Dria says, "gender becomes ephermal...manipulable...part of the 
experimentation." 
zone nods to Speaker 
Alan says, "Okay, I'm with you.  In the case of "worse," "enhancement" is 
an odd ...er...odd choice of word.  An enhancement which makes something 
worse is a connotation that is usually reserved for Microsoft :-)" 
Dria says, "we are who we want to become." 
Speaker says, "Confusions of identity .... @gender commands ..." 
Dria laughs 
Dria says, "perhaps it was a poor choice of word." 
zone says to Dria, "I agree Dria...but I think it is also an opportunity 
to become more *who we are*...online serving as a mirror..." 
Speaker says, "Control faction ... moviong backwards and forwards from 
the 
abysss .." 
Speaker says, "ss" 
Dria asks, "what parts of life do *not* serve as mirrors?" 
Speaker says, "tremendous sexualisaion of the internet as a whole ..." 
Alan says, "No matter . . . I agree, though . . . the internet allows us 
to explore and experiment with reduced risk, but really though, how much 
of a risk is afforded.  I know that people can really get hurt--which 
comes as quite a surprise to them." 
Dria says, "it's the cultural restrictions which we ahve to deal with in 
rl." 
zone says to Dria, "You mentioned this thing about who we want to 
become...and I was noticing the opposite is also true..." 
Speaker says, "Most non-moderated spaces show this ..." 
Dria says, "that's why I said minor risk...the risk exists...the 
phenomenon of cyberrape...that cannot be overlooked." 
Speaker says, "Sexualisation ... desires implicit just about everywhere 
..." 
Alan says, "Precisely.  We can dump some cultural baggage, but I think 
people who think the net.sex is "safe" are a bit under-net.sex'd." 
Speaker says, "16 minutes ... 4 to go " 
Speaker says, "language loses its formal syntactic structure ..." 
Dria says, "it's safer than rl, imho...injury is of a different nature 
entirely." 
Speaker says, "Raviushment becomes the unravelling of language..." 
Alan says, "There a plenty of cases where net.sex has penetrated the 
condom-as-interface and  and hit the user right where it hurts." 
Speaker says, "Woman he knew who would short out the keyboard with her 
wet 
hand after coming .." 
Speaker says, "Streams of characters ..." 
Speaker says, "fbnu bgyf hgf hgf hf hgbfh jgthrjigbtrubigperhbubhuehtuig 
bubtg4 75ub4 htgb4 u5tgb4 5ugpbu4pihu5ughbu54ibgutbgubthbgubt " 
Speaker says, "Ah, tht's better." 
Alan says, "weroiusc sfdrmss sadfsdflj asdfsdj4r32wq" 
Raxcip laughs 
Ghost says to Dria, "psychological hurt is still psychological hurt" 
Alan shrugs 
zone says, "seroshlkjlllllll kisslillhh .lkjjiliiiiiiillllmmmmmm" 
Alan says, "Exactly." 
Dria says, "as I said, different.  " 
Speaker says, "cu-seeme is more uncanny and disturbing  than y-talk ..." 
Dria asks, "you really can't see the difference in risk?" 
Speaker says, "Silence of cu-seeme ... uncanny ... uncomfortable ... 
fascinating ... becasue of the faces ..." 
Speaker says, "faces erupt in different direction .." 
Alan asks, "Is it possible that a face can be thought of as genitalia?" 
Speaker says, "recognition ..." 
Speaker says, "didn't get to death on the internet ..." 
Dria thinks about Michael. 
Speaker says, "Tomorrow: Michael Current's fdeath ..." 
zone says, "le petit mort" 
Speaker says, "Thankyou ..." 
Speaker recieves applause .. 
Raxcip says, "only insomuch as every part of the body is sexual, (faces)" 
Dria applauds for Alan :) 
Martin says, "Questions ..." 
Martin asks, "?" 
Speaker says, "... cleaning up ..." 
Ghost goes out through the out door. 
Alan says, "Stelar laughed at the notion of cleaning up." 
Alan says, "=c" 
Dria laughs 
Alan says, "Apparently in Austrialia, Kant is pronounced "cunt."" 
Speaker says, ""Jerry asks about Kant ... Alan thought he meant something 
else ... talking about netsex ..." 
Speaker says, "It is." 
Dria bites hir tongue 
Martin says, "probably for good reason" 
Speaker says, "carry sexuality beyond what happens in Alan's real life 
.." 
Speaker says, "as it becomes more real ... series of exchnages ..." 
Speaker says, "list ... priovate mail .. ." 
Speaker says, "more emotional .." 
Speaker says, "relationshiop ..." 
Speaker says, "phone call " 
Speaker says, "phone sex ..." 
Speaker says, "y-talk ..." 
Speaker says, "photos ..." 
Dria nods...got the first phonecall today :> 
Speaker says, "peices of hair ..." 
Speaker says, "souvenirs ..." 
zone smiles 
Speaker says, "anything ..." 
Raxcip says, "sextoys..." 
Speaker says, "Small animals .." 
Dria laughs 
Raxcip asks, "?" 
Alan says, "Panties, panties" 
Speaker says, "Oh yes, panties ..." 
Dria says, "oh, don't forget the panties." 
Speaker says, "That was a typo  . ..." 
Raxcip grins 
zone says, "oh yeah...and remember panties" 
Speaker uses the word "coagulation" a lot ... 
Alan says, "Effluvia and coming together in a matted position." 
Speaker says, "Question intimates that Jerry ta;ling and Alan typing was 
like Gilbert and George ..." 
Alan says, "Group net.sex." 
Dria  thinks...hm, time to break out the erotica ;> 
Speaker says, "like dria" 
Speaker licks Dria ever so slowly. 
Alan says, "Except that the group is one person." 
Dria freezes, deer in the headlights ;> 
Dria says, "Yummy" 
Speaker says, "Richness of net.sex " 
Speaker says, "Turn off the computer ... left with own reflection in 
screen ..." 
Dria says, "the mirror." 
Apocryphal says, "..." 
Speaker says, "Different movements ..." 
Raxcip says, "yes, thats the part I hate.  The computer off me alone" 
Apocryphal says, "or nothing...the matte, blankness" 
Speaker says, "y-talk is like two bodies separated by
