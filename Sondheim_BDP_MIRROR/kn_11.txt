Zazen


I wrote the following five months ago. I wrote it because the situation
was one I was both accustomed to, daily routine, and unaccustomed to,
Japan. When I wrote it, I was aware that I would be torn from Japan, no
matter what, that I would be elsewhere. When I wrote it, I was living what
was described - that is, the description was a matter of looking around.
Then the text becomes another matter, that of reconstitution, and I am
forced into the position of the reader; such is memory. 

In this fashion, each and every thing becomes virtual and no longer holds
ground, and the differentiations of signifiers also signify the differen-
tiations of circumstances and selves. Behind every memory there is an ava-
tar; behind every avatar there are uneasy dreamings, presentiments. I knew
when I was writing the following that I would not be the one who had writ-
ten the following. I knew this while writing it. I turn around, now again
examine my circumstances, and find such is the case. The gap continues to
grow, and bears the burden of death. When death comes, finally, the gap is
sutured.
