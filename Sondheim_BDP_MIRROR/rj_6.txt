We're pleased to announce two new vinyl releases on the Fire Museum label! 
The first one is Cauldron by Alan Sondheim, Helena Espvall & Azure Carter. 
The other is Circle of Crosses by Dora Bleu, Tom Carter and Sam Shalabi. 
These releases are domestically produced 140 gram vinyl, housed in an 
offset printed cover with j-card style obi. These are split releases with 
Tequila Sunrise Records. From the write ups:

Cauldron - Cauldron deals out a three of cups: Alan Sondheim, a pioneer of 
mystical ear-tweak and sci-fi sonic ritual sound, chamber-improv gypsy 
cellist Helena Espvall, and eco-trance singer Azure Carter? thrice to 
thine and thrice to mine, and thrice again, to make up nine. Channeling 
the ghosts of Opal Whiteley and Lou Harrison, Cauldron conjures the 
scratch and shush of the Big Bang out of wood, wind and cat-gut. Whenever 
you listen to it, this album is always over too soon, just like life. Fire 
Museum and Tequila Sunrise Records deal out a two of pentacles: not to get 
all ?Yankee Candle? here, but we only made 250 of these, so grab one 
before they melt away like chemtrails in the sunset sky,
