why i'm dead meat, by jennifer


Republicans ooze from their heads what is left of soul's rubbish 
i could not stand to be in a room with one of them 
they are objects for me, they reek of flesh gone sour 
i would be a lichen to their rock, corroding their violent granite
they would kill everyone with guns and they are all white men,
every last one of them, no matter what drear affirmation.
white men filled with dead pus: they stomp the children of the poor,
rape pollution laws, guarantee we'll drown the world in poison.
we're raped with rusted guns from world war two three four,
while they fight the righteous fight against women sex longing -
holding dead children on sticks to slap us with, banner banner
big money big money.
i couldn't stand to party with righteousness
i couldn't stand to fuck righteousness but their holes are closed
they have no holes, shit leaks from their mouths, 
piss leaks from their eyes, they write vomit
they are a real danger, never forget this, behind words 
are guns and mobs and real men, you never forget a real man
when you look into his dead dead eyes, when you see a Republican
on the road, kill it, it is not quite human.
