meaning to imply that the everyday world itself is already cyborgian to a
great degree, blank walls and terminals beyond which one does not pene-
trate without fear of destruction, that this is the new condition of the
world, against, for example, that of _steam:_ Place the rod against the
crankshaft over by the cylinder there. 

which means that we are at a loss among our objects, beginning with the
shamanic pill or secrecy of the fetish-object. which means that this has 
always been the case, tacit knowledge playing a major role, as long as 
the probes _held_ as now they do not.

for think of the clean rooms necessary, the vacuums, the stability against
which the most trained hand and arm behave like earthquake destroyers. so.
just so.

existing in a permanent state of loss (NOT of lack, NOT of absence, NOT of
sin, original or otherwise), humanity is free to explore its death. as
such, it is also free to explore its life, frivolous play, lassitude, lan-
guor, infinite erotics, starvations, extinctions: FOR A LIMITED TIME ONLY. 

(as if: GET YOURS WHILE THEY LAST as _venture capital_ fills the gaps left
behind by tinkering or bricolage - thus _capital_ replaces the mobile ap-
pliance itself, .html warding off death within the cleansed landscape of
the Web catching and constructing the consumer, again: FOR A LIMITED TIME
ONLY, upgrading beyond the life of this and every other body.)
