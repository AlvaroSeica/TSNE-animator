My History of the Net, by Jennifer


Jennifer has a most beautiful day today. Today the air is just so. Today
the air is neither warm nor cold nor lukewarm nor cool. Today I swim in
perfect air. Today I wear my frock!

It is beautiful because I find the old-man-shard. I am walking down the
path and there is ocotillo and I stumble and there is the old-man-shard!
It is Mimbres I am sure and not an animal. 

Because you are air-temperature and you are annealing. Because it hardens
in your hand and lasts forever. Because you make the sound of charcoal
burning with your hand and a smoke and a fissure and a furrow.

Jennifer is clear glass, and spun. She spins a most beautiful and annoy-
ing.  Bushy creosote spreads from the center of the frock. It is twelve
twelve thousand and twelve years old-man-shard, linking lovely Jennifer-
belly!

Just then a baby Jennifer just like Jennifer then! Because you are exactly
the air-temperature alloy of perfection! Jennifer has a most beautiful day
today and will take a lovely walk. You will buy things.

I will hug and kiss you!
