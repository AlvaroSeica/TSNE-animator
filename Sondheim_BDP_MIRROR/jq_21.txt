Again tonight teaching through a netstorm, lowered bandwidth and expecta-
tions, the students staring blankly at 404s coming in for a landing across
the screen, projections of emptied spaces, mutilated sites, questions
about the degree and abundance of changed addresses and directories as
webmistresses and masters hurridly reorganize for the millennium, web-bil-
lionaires at the ready plying the enormous increase of languages and sed-
uctions... 

A student finding herself less interested in the Net, partly disgusted it
seems to me, as a result of the _Web-39_ who are now considered a _compu-
ter cult,_ in spite of the fact that the recruits were long-time ago real
life incoming like 404s on the laptop projections, meanwhile the Net turns
fallow, exhausted, stuttering, equipment arriving half-hour after class-
time, me screwing up on the touchpad which responds like stirred jello as
far as ease and accuracy is concerned...

Outside it's raining turned to snow, the equipment was taken from one room
to another out there in that, for once for some reason everyone shows up
for the miserable showing of crashed websites like incoming 404s thrown on
the screen in spite of any reasonable content, the lights don't dim right,
Netscape kept crashing, sites were hung or moved without warning, I could-
n't even mumble about community, we're all perverts here after children
except that the kids are all fake seventy-year-old pedophiles engaged in
violent hacking flamewars enticing virgins into the wrong end of ponds...

Don't shout, the lights are out.
