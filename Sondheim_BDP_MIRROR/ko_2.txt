Demonstration that who do you love does _not_ register on BSD Unix but
Instead sends the Machine into Self-questioning in a form I cannot But

(EXPLANATION)
The who command lists current online users; who mom loves was designed
to producer the name of the questioner. who do you love produces an oddly
formatted answer in one form of Unix, and is ignored on another. Ju80lu|
is the prompt on one machine, and Ju3lu% is the prompt on the other. jen-
nifer is the substituted name for the current user of this machine. ttyp
is an abbreviation for teletype and is a holdover from the days when
teletype consoles were the order of the day. panix3 is a unix machine at
panix; panix7 is a new high-speed BSD unix machine. Ju80lu and jennifer
circulate around issues of identity; mom, note, doesn't figure into the
series of questions. i'm somewhere behind or in the middle of Ju80lu and
jennifer, losing myself in their circulations. The 80 in Ju80lu refers
to the 80th command entered and its position is represented by a variable
in my personal configuration file. who _i_ am is literally the order of
the day.
