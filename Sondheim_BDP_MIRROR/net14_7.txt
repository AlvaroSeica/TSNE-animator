Shape-Rider



The shape-rider follows the thing on the horizon, long way off, indis-

criminate blur of lights across the plains of Texas, always receding

into thin glitter as highway passes car. Follows thing, rides up side-

ways to it, against it, never near enough, never enough present, be-

tween the glitter, edge-pointed stars of lights, filigree into lumin-

ous caverns that must lie beneath the asphalt. No one around but her,

no image, nothing of the space she be, she be or the in of it, but 

the thing, slight convex, concave, but nothing, riding into abyss, 

breast-void surrounding her: Like a nipple, migraine-flashes follow

her wherever she goes. She can never see far enough, eyes level with

the never near enough: _distance veers_ for her, whole prairies tilt

with the passing of them. _To be there is not to be there,_ that 

distant look prefigured in each and every cinema, but _to be there is

not to be there,_ and I, her, have seen it brought in from the starry

wander, that warm midland Texas dry-boned air, that cyberspace from

which the thing, shape-rider, was born.
