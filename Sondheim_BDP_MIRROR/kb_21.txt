Dreaming, unwell, I can no longer understand my dreams; dream-signs wri-
tten in false dream-kanji clutter the dream-landscape - dream-writing
becomes inert, signifier of incomprehension, and writing slips back into
the world it once mediated. Dream-world or world, dream-mediation hold-
ing back the dream-real or real, now lost to dream-interpretation: they
are _here,_ they are my dream-foreign; there is no dream-comprehension,
dream-therapeutic; only broken dream-bodies with common dream-blood and
dream-bones abound. You see you may take "dream" out of this in any
"dream-space," but you cannot add past the inert; I am dream-suffocated
in the dream-real or real; I am dream-mute, suspicious of _all_ dream-
meaning and meaning; I do not understand my dream-face or scars on my
body; I do not dream-age or age. Dreaming, unwell, I am manipulating signs
_as I speak_ and I no longer dream-understand what my dream-face or face
is saying, is desperate, unwell. Dreaming, I dream-type or type-this to
you "given the hope that" some dream-sense or sense will come, but I am
gone, dream-dead or dead, turned to dream-ash or ash, these are kanji, 
are they not, you, stone, ash, body, dream, language, ash, kanji, see?
