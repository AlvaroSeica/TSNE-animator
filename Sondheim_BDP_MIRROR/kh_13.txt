Parable: The Poor Man Goes to Heaven


There once was a poor man who observed the 613 laws and the seven
commandments, as well as the masses and fasts. He died and went to
heaven. To his surprise, the gates were open, and he walked right in.
Everywhere he looked, there were flagstones. 

What more could the poor man want. When he slept he remembered his
letters. When he woke, he counted days. Nothing fell through the 
cracks. One day, he died, but there was nowhere to go.

You are nothing if you understand this second death, said Daishin
Nikuko. Salvation is at the price of the text; only read uncertainty
into the world, and you will have your desires fulfilled, your wishes
turned to desire.
