Jumble

After this I needed air.

The jumble begins to take advantage of screen resolution and frame/flicker 
rate; objects revolve and generate lissajous/moire/illusory patterns as a 
result of hatchings and cross-hatchings, read/write speed, cache speed, 
and a host of other variables.Jumble changes from machine to machine, 
resolution to resolution, and shading operators. Moving through the space, 
turning video/sound on and off - the phenomenology changes in relation to 
the dialectic established when an abacus was first used, at lightning 
speed, bullae scattered everywhere. Every marker is always already virtu- 
al, every marker is on the way towards disappearance, every annihilation
has the potential for memory, perhaps later, inscription. The jumble here 
resolves, as every jumble does, on a micro-level; it is the non-aristotel- 
ian that throws everything off, gesture which trips up where raster and 
orthogonal configurations lie.

Jumble in physical reality = noisy, not chaotic. Jumble in Second Life = 
equivalent to the order of perfection = the perfection of order.
