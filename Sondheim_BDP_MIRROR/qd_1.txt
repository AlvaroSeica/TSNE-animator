New Jewels in the Metaverse


Sweeping everything aside and starting over.
Things are ephemeral of course, but ephemerality is imminent,
inhering.
Particles among particles, or fields, or anything else,
neither this nor that, not both this and that:
The entanglement of the Sheffer stroke and its dual.
The particles have more or less specific lives.
Memo to self: make these half-lives, bring probability in.

The _bridge_ is the difficulty moving from _description_ to 
_phenomenological theory._
"Here I am: I made something, let me tell you about it."
"Metaverse says: Making and unmaking, telling you nothing."
"No I, something, you, metaverse, nothing."
"Yes, now and to get on with it:

The _bridge_ is the difficulty moving from _description_ to
_phenomenological theory._
Otherwise _this_ describes nothing more than an instantiation.
The _accurate_ performance is a _mess._
A stupid question: Does the universe perform? Now if one considers
perhaps 10^500 universes, the metaverse, one can rephrase: Does 
the metaverse perform? 
Well the metaverse performs for itself.
And the metaverse is its performance-for-itself.
Which is no performance at all, but roiling.
Therefore the metaverse performs in our heads which are subjects
of metaverse performance. 
Yes, well, this is the tenor of all. Tenor of all of what, how can
we do anything but continue to speak in a projected night 
projecting cold; hereabouts, one might speak of the _project_ 
of the night. 
The project of the night is our performing performance; of course
it is _our_ project.
One wants to make it clear: This is the intellectual property
of the metaverse.

After the performance, these images.

And I think about _the slush fund of neutrinos._



pre-sent

from the viewpoint of the one, here i am writing this with closed eyes, 
concentrating on the thought putting itself forth, as if i were elsewhere, 
and from this point of view, all is interiority, just as sight records a 
permanence unlost in time as hearing is lost, as touch is not, and warmth 
is intermediate; smell is a motion and a process, just as taste; smell 
might remain, but taste disappears with the capacity to ingest perhaps. 
you can see the embeddings of time in the senses, and in the roiling of my 
constructions in virtual worlds, time is dissipated just as hearing is 
always already a disappearance and smell or taste are embodied only in 
memory, only present in memory, never presented, never in a present: the 
knowledge of the organism is the knowledge of the present as pre-sent.

but what i give you, can give you here, are the captured screens, the shot 
snaps, the death of the imaginary, the dead-roiling always on the move, 
ghosts without feet, just ghosts.
