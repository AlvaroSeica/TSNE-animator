What Truth wrote:

"I write a dead prose. Crack. Crack. Apostolic exclamation marks gone,
commas gone, periods gone. Mouth flaps uselessly, result of internal
synaptic stutterings. Suppose air went in, came out. Clothes wear,
out. For no, uncertain, purpose. Nikuko loses, speech, Nakasukawabata
that place, where an arch says, excite. It needs, the force of a body 
behind it. Case is a colon: a mouth jerks, displacing. Needing, more
than a rush of air, almost an excite. Nikuko lives in a country, long, 
dead inside. In deed, dead. Don't, mistake her. She is like any other. 
She does not, like any other."
