I call up machines, I control machines thousands of miles away, they write
what I tell them to, they send me returns, the returns are on my screen
here at home, they're messages from afar, my structures are world-struc-
tures, my structures are world-wide. My screen is always already foreign,
my screen is always already alterity, my screen is other and transcendent
and absolute beneath the signatures of protocols. I send out 320 messages.
The messages come from these keystrokes; I can see and hear them. All you
get is residue, stains. You send something back and for me, it's the same
- residues, stains, one machine to another, acknowledgments and synchroni-
zations. We will talk together and I don't know who you are but everything
is filled with the foreign, these letters staring back at me are never my
own.
