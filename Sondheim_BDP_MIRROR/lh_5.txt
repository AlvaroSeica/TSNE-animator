doctor leopold konninger shuddering on the couch, naked, his body
  dissolving before us, calling nikuko
who lies heaving, sprawled on the couch, naked, her body decaying
  before us, calling the doctor -
doctor leopold konninger sitting naked on the couch, his nipples
  grabbed by nikuko the beautiful russian ballet dancer, twisted,
while nikuko sits partly clothed on the couch, her thin blouse
  pulled up, her nipples grabbed by doctor leopold konninger -
doctor leopold konninger in a pensive moment calling nikuko -
but the bodies of doctor leopold konninger and nikuko the beautiful
  russian ballet dancer are shredding before us -
and closeups of labia and penises grace our screens, veering back
  and forth, oh whose can they be, the closeups splintering right
  there in front of us -
their faces are in shadow, their feet are akimbo, their arms are
  askew, their mouths are ajar -
doctor leopold konninger sits naked on the couch and nikuko the
  beautiful russian ballet dancer sits naked on the doctor and
  their bodies are splattered, arms shattered, legs spattered,
  breasts scattered, necks sputtered, minds skittered -
they topple forward and you can see the couch neatly arranged
  with footprints of the audience leaving out of boredom and
  ennui, out of exhaustion and detumescence, out of irritation
  with their continuous display -
they're dancing in their minds -
they're dancing in their minds -
they're dancing in their minds -
high, hoe, the dairy, oh!
they're dancing in their minds -
