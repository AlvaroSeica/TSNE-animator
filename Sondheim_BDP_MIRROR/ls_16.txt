the 14

when you try to grasp _it,_ there is process
when you try to grasp process, there _it_ is
on the other side of process, there it is
on the other side of it, there is process

if you follow the way, the way is _it_
on the other side of _it_ is the way
when you try to grasp the way, there _it_ is
when you try to grasp _it,_ that is the way

there is no mind and no wisdom and no appearance
on the other side of mind and wisdom is appearance
on the other side of appearance there is appearance

one cannot grasp from one side to the other
there are no sides, no processes, no phenomena
from negation are protocols for carving out the world
