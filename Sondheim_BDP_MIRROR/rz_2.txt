Our proposal in brief:

Pain dance / performance in OpenSim with Sandy Baldwin: textual 
materials would be presented in the form of chat and sound-over/ 
voice-over. We would be working with distorted avatars and 
modeling from tissues, etc. [We'll perform in Second Life.] The 
text would deal with issues of death, sex, and pain in virtual 
worlds.



hearing singing

What I've been thinking about is singing. I can't sing and can 
rarely even match notes with an instrument. There seems to be a 
disconnect between my brain and my ears; I can tell if others are 
in tune or not, but for myself, it seems almost impossible. So 
instruments have to sing for me, but I have to learn to play them 
'in the small,' that is without thinking about the voice. What's 
external to the body - the instrument - has to be internalized; 
what's internal - song/voice production - has to be externalized 
and forgotten. I play through the clumsiness of beginning to 
listen and hear through my fingers in conjunction of course with 
'normal' hearing. When I hear a song sung, I can't reproduce it 
either. I don't hear harmony well. But when I'm playing, when I'm 
'within' the range of the instrument, I do well, I know the 
neighborhoods of the notes, the distant regions, and how to get 
there and wander through them musically with my fingers. It's 
strange, it's a different world than almost any other musician, 
but it's what I have to work with. I used to play with Al Wilson 
(the Owl in the group Canned Heat) who had incredible hearing and 
incredible voice; he was amazed I could do anything at all given 
that my tonal range was less than an octave. I worry my speaking 
voice might be monotone but that doesn't seem to be the case from 
what others tell me. On top of this I have serious tinnitus and 
there doesn't seem to be any way to control that either... And 
sadly, Jonathan Winters just died, it just came over the air :-(

Jululost

When the platform disappeared and everything fell it was 
almost impossible to find Julu and bring hir back, since
the boundaries were lost and A.D. wasn't able to establish
new ones to set a home landmark. So everything was up in
the air but more or less on the ground; Julu kept trying
to follow A.D. but since s/he wasn't there, s/he could only
move uselessly near a signpost that meant nothing to hir.
Oh for those heady days. Later A.D. was able to re-mark
hir territory for Julu and offered teleport and all was
settled in a new demarcation. But this took a while and by
then everyone had gone home but at least A.D. knew Julu 
was safe at least for the moment and hir useless energy and
skittering had come to a halt. Sometimes there's nothing
much to see but the remnants of loneliness and the fear 
that the Other has disappeared, leaving vacuum behind, if
that even, and perhaps not even that. It's as if every
gesture were an unreadable portent, the literate popula- 
tion having long since disappeared, without enough variety
left in the gene-pool to continue the species. This is
well what Julu is confronted with in hir ignorance; there
is nothing seen and nothing to be seen. And then as I've
said, this miracle of appearance, the proffering of tele-
port and the presence of the resuscitated platform, as if
nothing at all had changed or ever would.

Suroz, ghichak, viola, and electric saz 
with Ed Schneider on tenor, which brings
up the interesting point that the phoneme
sa- can be used with the last four 
letters of the alphabet, saw, sax, say, 
saz - as well as the fact the music is
great (although I sound a bit muddied 
which means I'm going to have to spring
for a second mic and/or mixer)

Final text for HASTAC on the Anthropocene Extinction

(Click http://www.alansondheim.org/hastac.docx for
 download!)

The text will be accompanied by a video from Second
Life. It will be slightly chaotic. I can think of
objections to everything I've written but have had
to stop.

This has been revised and revised; it's not as orderly
now, the threads interweave. I have few references,
since the whole has to be around 20 minutes maximum. 
I used E. O. Wilson, various; Science and Science News,
Kathy Rudy, Loving Animals: Toward a New Animal Advocacy,
Matthen and Stephens eds. Philosophy of Biology: Handbook
of The Philosophy of Science, various Buddhist texts,
email information from a number of advocacy groups, and 
my own practical paleontological knowledge of fossils 
from the Pennsylvanian and Carboniferous. I have a sense,
if not the intelligence, of deep time. 

I want to thank everyone who commented on earlier 
versions, especially Jon Marshall. I would have 
liked to have written extensively on negation and
the virtual, but there wouldn't be time to develop
it in the context of the conference.

in of air

air suffers no boundary, presents none
supportive of life, life falls through, thermals rising
supporting life, air churns
in every direction, nothing, planet afterthought
gravity planet hold air _there_
air suffuses within air, microbial national environments
for a while, breathing and breathing through
held within my hand, air, other air keeping it still,
 air sleeps, column thankful for a restful moment
substance of air removes itself back into place
looking, at it through it at it through it
what clouds it, comes from elsewhere, puckers, gathers,
 remnants and air can wait, what clouds it comes within,
 from within
within air, within is always here, here and elsewhere
photography comes through the air, the history of
 photography comes through the air, the photograph
 comes through the air
every liter of air, differentiable, uncanny, what
 remains the same and different, utterly the same,
 utterly different
to the air, she said, take to the air
dreams in corners, cornered, the air has none, air
 visits, what air

Taking Heat Somewhere Else

We're living in a cambrian moment? Writing movable type Printing. 
Digital etc. At least 42 people have died in a heatwave that has 
brought soaring temperatures to a dozen US states from the Midwest 
to the East Coast.

Crops shrivelled and roads and railway lines buckled in the heat. 
We're living in a cambrian moment? Writing movable type Printing. 
Digital etc.

Hundreds of records fell across the affected area on Friday and 
Saturday, but the heat was expected to ease slightly on Sunday.

We're living in a cambrian moment? Writing movable type Printing. 
Digital etc. Severe storms are expected to follow. Many homes in 
the region are still without power after storms a week ago.


A command centre in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park helped 
visitors after the deadly storm We're living in a cambrian moment? 
Writing movable type Printing. Digital etc. Media reports say many 
of the deaths were of elderly people stuck in homes without air 
conditioning because of the outages.

Ten deaths in Chicago were blamed on the heat, and at least 10 
each in the eastern states of Virginia and Maryland.

Three each died in Wisconsin, Ohio and Pennsylvania, and two in 
Tennessee. We're living in a cambrian moment? Writing movable type 
Printing. Digital etc.

A four-month-old girl died after being left in a car for "an 
extended period" outside her home in Greenfield, Indiana.

On Saturday temperatures reached 105F (41C) in Washington DC - 
just short of the hottest ever recorded in the city - and 107F 
(46C) in St Louis, Missouri, which also extended its record for 
consecutive days over 100F to 10.

"It's hotter than hell," tourist John Ghio, visiting the White 
House, told Reuters news agency.

"Too hot," said Chinese tourist Xiao Duan, 30, who was also 
visiting Washington. "We're living in a cambrian moment? Writing 
movable type Printing. Digital etc."

"My father says it's like we're being burned by flames."

High temperatures have also hit parts of Canada, with temperatures 
on Friday breaking 11 daily records in Ontario.

Storms to follow

Hundreds of thousands of people in West Virginia, Virginia, Ohio, 
New Jersey, Maryland and Indiana are still enduring power outages 
caused by storms that swept through the area one week ago.

A number of cities have opened cooling centres and extended 
opening hours for public swimming pools.

Some communities are offering meals to residents whose food has 
spoiled after their refrigerators stopped working. "We're living 
in a cambrian moment? Writing movable type Printing. Digital etc."

Officials in Chicago cancelled summer schools classes in 21 
buildings without air conditioning because of the heat.

The heat there buckled a major road, cracking and bulging part of 
Columbus Drive by 5in (12cm).

Cooler weather is said to be on the way for northern parts of the 
Midwest, although strong storms could accompany the lower 
temperatures.

Is this true? "We're living in a cambrian moment? Writing movable 
type Printing. Digital etc."

Incident at YYZ Toronto International Airport


We were in Toronto for the HASTAC Conference at York University. 
We left Sunday late afternoon. At the airport we checked our bag. 
We then took the bag through customs. We went through several 
stages. We had the bag tagged. We showed our boarding-passes and 
passports everywhere. We filled out the customs declarations. We 
waited in lines. We went through a long line. Azure had her 
boarding-pass stamped. The Canadian official forgot to stamp mine. 
We went through another line. We turned things in. I was stopped 
two stops later and told to return to the Canadian official. The 
line to reach him took a half hour the first time. I walked two 
stops back. I reached a U.S. official who had allowed us through 
the first time. I said do I have to go through the whole line 
again. I was annoyed. He told me I was being rude. He started 
yelling. He told me one of the three Canadian soldiers present 
would escort me back [it was to booth 20]. He was furious. He said 
if the soldiers have time. He said be polite to them. He said 
don't interrupt them. He said be nice to them. He was glaring at 
me. And for a moment I felt I was in a foreign country, the United 
States of America. He was bullying. His sarcasm was stupid. His 
insults were flat. His eyes impaled. Other people watched. He kept 
his eyes focused 'in that male gaze way' on me. He wanted me to 
challenge him. He wanted to arrest me for something. He wanted to 
humiliate me. I said nothing. The soldier was fine, the Canadian 
official joked with me, the U.S. guy let me through. I didn't look 
at him. People afterwards asked us what happened. I didn't know. 
All I knew is that here was an ugly bullying American who liked a 
uniform and didn't like me. Who wanted to arrest me; more, I was 
sure he was going to hit me. I kept thinking: here's the police 
and here's the police leakage across the border. You check INTO
the United States while still in Canada. Canada, throw them out. 
I thought: this guy owns guns. I thought: this guy wants _action._ 
I thought of his pleasure: humiliation. I wanted to strike out at 
him. I was powerless _there._ _There_ was _here._

I came back to the States and played cura and did this piece:

http://lounge.espdisk.com/archives/1115 (best)
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/stations.mp3

I wanted to play as many styles as possible in as short a time as
possible. But it's long. I want to wrap the strings around his
eyes. I want to slam him to the ground. He turns me ugly. He turns
me enemy combatant. He turns me _collateral damage._

I don't play guns with cura. Of the music: cura _cures._

[ A rewrite of a narrative; I spent some time looking for a talker, a form 
of chat and architecture popular before the Web, still online. This is the 
only one I found, in Estonia. I wrote the sysadmin and he gave me a name 
and password. I went in and explored and rewrote the 'review' dialog, 
which was a remnant of Estonians who had been in the talker before. So 
they were ghosts. I didn't understand their dialog - it was in Estonian 
and I thought in any case publishing would be a violation of privacy. So I 
wrote my own dialog as a result, substituting for theirs. It was an eerie 
space. - Alan ]
