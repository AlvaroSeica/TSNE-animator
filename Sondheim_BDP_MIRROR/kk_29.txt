Tattoo on FTP


I connect, myself to myself, as Odin, picking up runes; here I am placing
them, one after another, my private server, serving me well and too much
doing my bidding. My runes are my piercings, my body a syzygy of signs.

Connected to gol1.gol.com.

For to the extent it does my bidding, it does not do my bidding, and to
the extent it does not do my bidding, it does my bidding. Meanwhile, host
watches on, over so great a distance as to make the span of a bridge
thinned to inconceivable webbing; nonetheless, it carries.
