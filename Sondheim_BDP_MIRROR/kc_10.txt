Nikuko on the This-or-That of Information:


"All things sank to the same level, a surface resembling a blind mir-
ror that no longer reflects, that casts nothing back. The prevailing
dimension became that of extension and number. Intelligence no longer
meant a wealth of talent, lavishly spent, and the command of energies,
but only what could be learned by everyone, the practice of a routine,
always associated with a certain amount of sweat and a certain amount
of show. In America and in Russia this development grew into a bound-
less etcetera of indifference and always-the-sameness - so much so
that the quantity took on a quality of its own.* Since then the domin-
ation in those countries of a cross section of the indifferent mass
has become something more than a dreary accident. It has become an
active onslaught that destroys all rank and every world-creating im-
pulse of the spirit, and calls it a lie. This is the onslaught of what
we call the demonic (in the sense of destructive evil)." (Heidegger,
An Introduction to Metaphysics, trans. Manheim.)

*"All dieses steigerte sich dann in Amerika und Russland in das mass-
lose Und-so-weiter des Immergleichen und Gleichgueltigen so weit, bis
dieses Quantitative in eine eigene Qualitaet umschlug."
