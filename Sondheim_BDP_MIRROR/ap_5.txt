On the Road Back


Has this happened to you? David gets in touch with me from the years at 
Brown University in Rhode Island; I contact Edward, from Cybermind add- 
ress, from the L.A. years; Julien emails me from those Montreal times 
off-line; Kathleen from time in Atlanta; others from New York, Ron from 
Buffalo; Bob from New Haven, now of Prague; they arrive in my Inbox 
through due solicitation, theirs or mine, a dozen more as well, _this_ 
life collapses; Ian from Halifax and brother Mark from Victoria; Joanna, 
daughter, from Los Angeles and Robert from Atlanta; Lee from Texas; & 
mists swirl time over 30 years 25 cities collapsed into _this_ space of 
lucky & unlucky enumeration; skin and cloth write bone and cloth; there 
is Fred from Providence; & Carol Androsky you are still not on line but 
your friend in NM did in fact connect; now whom or what conflagration 
lights hair burned into protocol beacon; there is Peter married to my 
sister in Toronto; what is this return towards what dark earth etc.; what 
guise or mire etc.; towards what occasion gone askew spirit awry; and 
towards those who are yet to come thus burn my face into a ground; wail 
and solicit: STAY FOR THE DURATION.
