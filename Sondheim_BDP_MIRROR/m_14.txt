You bend over backwards to read us.


I wash myself of the hole thing. I clean myself out forwards and back-
wards. I give up, I've bent over backwards for you. If you speak behind my
back you're facing me. I can't face the hole thing. I wring my hands over
it.  I can't hear a word you say. You smell. You wash me out of your 
hair. You clean yourself out nice and proper. You give up, you've bent 
over backwards for me. If I speak behind your back, I'm facing you. You 
can't face the hole thing. You wring your hands over it. You can't hear a 
word I say. I smell.
