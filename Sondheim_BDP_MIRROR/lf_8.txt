watching the project develop, i go inside me
i don't know what i'll find there, things reveal themselves
things push themselves out, there are always new things pushing
i want to burrow in the ground, i want to hide there with you
i'll give multiple births, i'll eat soil, my hair turns matted
i'll go further than any of you although it will seem like i'm
  standing still
my dreams push themselves out, shinto begins to give way
the spaces are cluttered like the nikko shrine
my chest tears out from within, others strip me of my clothes
i go in as far as i can
there's no more room
looking out, panoramas everywhere, i suppose there are suns
tell me about the suns, i can't speak
what can i tell you when my arms are bound, mouth close against you
turn around, i'm pressed into your back
i'm in you, dark and loving comfort, panorama black, countrysides
  disappear
in the distance, a voice - who is hanging there?
