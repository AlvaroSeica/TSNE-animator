emotions decrees music zero (maybe the sound redeems me)


3 solos reflecting a state of consciousness brought about by j indicating 
she can tell my moods by the titles for example frustration indicating so 
though s/he misses the excitement behind which i'm neutral though the 
stuff i make most likely isn't and going broke doesn't help things along 
the way as i try to fasten onto 'something creative' so this part's true 
my nails cracked something about stress and sleeping in the office at 
brown and then i don't want to think about much most music stresses me but 
mine doesn't why is that so anyway this is all play-arounds because i 
can't do my usual with the right hand there are always other paths. but 
really bio stuff - when i'm happiest i write ferocious about torture well 
when miserable something comes along out the window tentacle glass lens of

what frightens me most? that philosophy always the result of a damaged 
life will be itself damaged at best that i'll have nothing to say or it 
will be read as symptom or state-of-mind which shouldn't be a leverage at 
all any more than if i'm building /dev/nul it doesn't mean suicide or 
working as root isn't a sign of megalomania. the interstices of the text, 
the working-out of root issues against /dev/nul, the work of modeling a 
damaged species, this is fundamental. the sound of moi moi moi builds 
rooms where harmonics play against non-existent walls, play against them- 
selves, think of walls defined by harmonics, that is wavelengths, nothing 
material, you might have quantum rooms like that with music like this 
going on in them






Human modeling again (notes for a talk) 


I think 4 aspects - psychoanalytics, avatar-skin, medical modeling, AI 
communality/behavior/sociality - to be considered.

Well: Avatar-skin: surface of being human which is always a fiction; there 
is no exacting boundary where body ends and environment begins (think of 
breath, other processes). So this is splines, Bezier curves, NURBs, early 
polygon work, etc. now automated by Poser etc. Avatar-skin also applies to 
audio (later touch, scent, taste, etc.) - everything perceived from one 
human or other organism to another. 

Well: AI communality/behavior/sociality: the internally-automated behavior 
of the avatar-skin; think of this as diachronic avatar, and avatar-skin as 
synchronic; each moves through the other. With AI, avatar is somewhat 
spread across the social; communication and communality extend the opaque 
body (metaphorically) into the translucent. 
Fundamental rules of the 'game' tending towards description.

Well: Medical modeling: Both diachronic and synchronic, the projected/ 
introjected organs of the avatar-skin, always on the level of a model, 
i.e. a beating heart is fabricated on a subtextual level again from poly- 
gons, curves, splines, etc. The ontology is different as long as one 
remains within the realm of computational modeling. (One might say that 
_inscription_ in the real is paralleled by _fissure_ in the virtual.)
Medical modeling is fundamental description tending towards explanation.

Well: Psychoanalytics: Here is where the following have to be taken into 
account:
1. The abject: epistemological/ontological/inscriptive 'smears' across
domains. Corrosive and irreducible to the other categories.
2. Introjection/projection ('jectivity') - formation of internalized 
images from virtual to real.
3. Obscenity and interjections: Breakdowns of communication within 
communication.
Psychoanalytics are not susceptible to mathesis beyond topology.
(Level of the metaphoric: No verification procedures.)

But of course all of this is rough, not exactly accurate; ontology and 
epistemology, various branches and techniques of mathematics, can be 
thrown around heedlessly. Still I'd want to begin from the four aspects 
described here: body/surface, psychoanalytics/'mind', AI/habitus, and 
medical/observation-experimentation. One would have to further consider 
the role of apparatus, observation, observer, in all of this.

One final note - the concern - that, with formal and informal modeling 
systems of organisms/physics/mathematics: How is consciousness in 
relation? In other words, _what are the effects on the reader/programmer/ 
experimenter? How do these relate to abjection and jectivity if at all?





Notes from the Structure of Reality


In my Structure of Reality (which is under review), there are three funda- 
mental layers to what I call the 'topology of intention'; these are of 
interest since they critique any structuring, conscious or unconscious, 
'like a language.' The layers are the real, interpretation, and language; 
there is a 'zone' between the real and interpretation, and mappings all 
across the layers. The real is knowable through interpretation which does 
not presuppose language (syntactics, sememe); the mappings are tight, how- 
ever, between interpretation and language. One might think of this as a 
pre-linguistic representation without the thwarting embodiment of lan- 
guage. You can see this at work when the 'unnamed' of the real skews into 
anomaly - in other words, when anomaly appears without the aegis of lang- 
uage. Consider for example something falling without the presence of an 
ostensible object; the 'something falling' might be construed as such by a 
thud or less-interpretable sound. Repeat this enough and a name is gener- 
ated; if it remains on the level of a singularity or the anecdote, it 
might be quickly forgotten - except for the possibility of a marker of 
some sort, for example, a recording.

Heinz von Foerster: "Since nothing in the environment corresponds to 
negation, negation as well as all other 'logical particles' (inclusion, 
alternation, implication, etc.) must arise within the organism as a 
consequence of perceiving the relation of itself with respect to its 
environment." (From "Thoughts and Notes on Cognition.") SoR p. 69

Cyclical chains sailing past O and I - maybe modeling through the tangent 
function. Is the repetition assumed to be 'complete'? A cyclical chain is 
a loop with any number of nodes; think of one as nul, O, and another or 
the same as universal, I. Then circle. What happens? One moves from 0 
through infinity perhaps then back again. The simplest equation here: 
tangent. Each revolution is marked perhaps by sliding along the x-axis: 
equivalent but not identical graphs. And so we're there. We can visit as 
many times as we like.

Does distributivity really fail w gesture? (The old Land experiments in 
color vision as well as a structural analysis of gesture seem to imply 
that distributivity in Aristotelian logic fails in daily life - which 
further implies the potential for superimposition as the basis for a logic 
of gesture.)

The thinness of language - ontologically existing on the level of the 
sheave - language carries no weight at all. From within the avatar, the 
sheaves, surfaces, have zero-width, one-pixel width, nul-width, as 2d 
mathematical manifolds embedded within 3d space; they've all got the same 
measure as the continuum, but zero volume in the embedding space - like- 
wise language has zero volume.

Language, speaking, is always frustrated, flustered. It can't get around 
things. Meaning: One can't get around things through language, not even 
through performatives (which indicate real-material embodiment elsewhere).

Meditation medication goes nowhere.

Aristotle's Problems - sexual problems related to fluidity, abjection, in 
part iv - numbers pp 327-328, Loeb edition. The beginning of the fifteenth 
book is of great interest - he describes number systems with different 
bases which is fascinating given the apparent absence of zero.

Conservancy of the Problems, Bacon of all people working through them 
almost two thousand years later; not that much had changed. The Problems 
are on the level of the anecdote - curiosity cabinet, wonders - same as 
any fundamentalist text - wonder upon wonder without internalized 
structure or subtext - everything is new, raw, unrelated. Or causality is 
pushed back into categories which are taken for granted, even though, like 
heat or air, they're composite.

What is meant by modeling? Think of a 'world-particle' W whose scope is 
anything, process, etc.: W( ... ). what does that tell us? What are the 
processes of narrowing the scope, increasing the information - in other 
words filtering?

Along these lines, modeling is always a filtering.

Four negations: annihilation, -x s.t. --x > x; 'chain negation' s.t. -x > 
y; -y > z or whatever; combinations of these; negative of the 'set-aside' 
- form of retrievable absence.

States and nodes of graphs represented/mapped into states and nodes of 
graphs - this includes the possibility of 'foreign' graphs which are 
disruptive. The whole becomes an excursion into description rather than 
explanation, which is seen as a subset.

There should be limited copies of the Structure of Reality online/offline 
- dates from 1977, I wasn't a child.

Gita

Could the ancients hear spherics directly? Oh, I think so! 
Otherwise the drums would not have been constructed with additive
functions in mind.
Nor with spectral tonalities in mind. 
Remember, they harbor air and other spherics, closed and vibrating!
But surely not the aurora, is that additive?
Or magnetic storms, antipodean lightning strikes, are they additive?
Every particle has its split-second say! The drum reflects!
The drum resonates! Eight fingers, two thumbs, the drum resonates!
Whose counting? I am.

WHAT ARE THESE FISH

Please help me, what are these fish? Large schools gathered
tightly together in the Providence River, Rhode Island.
They're about 18" in length. I can only guess invasive species,
maybe ocean-hungry spawning but I DON'T KNOW FISH.

http://www.asondheim.org/fish8.jpg
http://www.asondheim.org/fish19.jpg

Time: late afternoon/early evening. 
Numbers: Approximately 1000.
Behavior: Swarming, schooling, occasional 'flashing' of sides.
Color: Seemed almost transparent, grey-blue, dull.

WHAT ARE THESE FISH I DON'T KNOW FISH

"However, notwithstanding this apparent variety, mantras are always regar- 
ded as a form of speech differing from language in that, unlike language, 
they are not bound by 'conventions' nor associated with objects, but on 
the contrary are oriented toward the very origin of the Word and of the 
energy."

From Vac, The Concept of the Word in Selected Hindu Tantras, Andre Padoux, 
SUNY Press, 1990.

"The pleasure in the act of Venus is the greatest of the pleasures of the 
senses; the matching of it with itch is unproper; ahtough that also be 
pleasing to the touch. But the causes are profound. First, all the organs 
of the senses qualify the motions of the spirits; and make so many several 
species of motions, and pleasure or displeasures thereupon, as there be 
diversities of organs. The instruments of sight, hearing, taste, and 
smell, are of several frame, and so are the parts for generation. 
Therefore Scaliger doth well to make the pleasure of generation a sixth 
sense; and if there were any other differing organs, and qualified 
perforations for the spirits to pass, there would be more than the five 
senses; neither do we well know whether some beasts and birds have not 
senses that we know not; and the very scent of dogs is almost a sense by 
itself."

From Bacon, Sylva Sylvarum, 693.

"The spline that is numbered as six defines the top of the breasts. It 
curves in to form the hollow of the back and the shoulder blades. This 
spline is also the widest of the three, because the area between splines 
five and six will overlap into the attached arms.

"Spline number seven outlines the middle of the breasts. Its effect on the 
shape of the breasts can be seen the clearest in the top view. The nipples 
are modeled separately and attached at the very front and slightly to the 
sides of spline number seven.

"The eighth spline [...] profiles the base of the breasts. In the front 
view, both splines seven and eight curve around to form the roundness of 
the breasts. While seven and eight curve down in the front view, number 
six curves up. The middle front vertices of splines seven through nine are 
moved up to form the thoracic arch. All three splines curve inward at the 
back for the shoulder blades and spine."

From 3-D Human Modeling and Animation, Peter Ratner, Wiley, 1998.

"Why do all men, both foreign and Greek, count in tens, and not in any 
other numbers? For instance, they might count 2,3,4,5, and then repeat 
one, five, two five, and so on as now they say eleven, twelve, and so on. 
Or why do they not stop at a number beyond ten and repeat from there? For 
each number is made by putting a preceding number and one, two, and so on 
with another number before them, and hence another number is formed, but 
they always count from ten as a limit. For as this is invariably done it 
clearly cannot be due to chance; for what is invariable and occurs in 
every case cannot be a chance arrangement but must be due to nature. [...] 
Or is it because all men have ten fingers? Having then counters of a 
natural number, they number all other quantities by this number. The 
Thracians are the only race who count in fours, because like children they 
cannot remember very far, nor have they any use for any large number."

From Aristotle, Problems, XV, 3, trans. W. S. Hett, Loeb, 1926.

"Their lives are graced through my reading their works come alive.
Devouring their living works compress their lives into one.
Insolence of their letters directed actions of my own.
Coming into fruition of work and life through my reading of them."

From Textbook of Thinking, Alan Sondheim, open-lock, 1991.

1. Why the turtle in turtle.jpg.
The turtle was there on the grounds; the film of the real was projected 
beyond or across the world of the turtle, or one should say, home. 

2. Why the film of the real. 
We watched the screen for hours on end in our home; leaves and branches, 
buildings and a solitary star anchored the image changing as the day 
changes, and the night.

3. Why the film.
The film was visible in the home of the day, which is to say the tiredness 
or sleep of the night; perhaps the night's dream played upon us for those 
days and weeks without end.

4. Why is the audience facing elsewhere.
Recording the mise en scene it was more than clear that so many of us are 
used to action, the propriety of seizure, grasping at straws; still, there 
was something inexorable in the uncanny image which practically slept its 
way across the homeland screen.

Xenakis at Target


The True Artist finds Inspiration everywhere. Here I was, in the popular 
Target "Department Store" searching for inexpensive miniDV tapes, when I 
noticed the speaker system began acting up in a most unusual way, as if it 
were consciously imitating the famed composer Xenakis. What to do, what to 
do! I quickly took out my surround-sound Zoom H2 solid-state audio recor- 
der, and began recording the remarkable Sound, as I paced from speaker to 
speaker, passing shoppers who paid little attention to the Beauty in their 
midst. Now my only hope is one of them, perhaps someone purchasing toys or 
kitchenware, will come across these files, and realize, with a sense of 
Loss and Ecstasy, what they had missed, and what has been returned. Ah, 
how little Memory is necessary when the hard molecular structure of the 
World gives us the Gift of the Past, space-time at our fingertips, silent 
Beauty sounding once again.

SL - theoretical approaches


Second Life behaviors come as animations which may eventually go down to 
the frame, but are packages in any case. There is a relation with older 
silent film and melodrama patterns - what have been dubbed histrionic 
gestures. A good text here is Bharata's Natyasastra, which discusses, 
among other things, rasa and pattern presentations. Patterns are used as 
generators of audience psychological response. The text not only considers 
patterns independently, but as group structures.

Second Life bodies touch on the abject, but don't 'enter' within it; there 
are issues of purity and corruption. Buddhaghosa's Visuddhimagga, Path to 
Purity, is extremely important in this regard, especially in relation to 
illusion and suffering. There are also kasinas which are may be related to 
landscape 'focal points' in SL. A second important text is the Hevajra- 
tantra with its multiple bodies; it might be worth looking at the works of 
Tsong Ka-Pa in this regard as well. (Again, Kristeva's Powers of Horror, 
Lingis, Mary Douglas, all come to mind.)

In terms of ontology, Nagarjuna's Mulamadhyamakakarika, The Fundamental 
Wisdom of the Middle Way, is critical, given its analysis of dependent 
(co)-origination ad emptiness. This correlates almost too neatly with the 
ontology and epistemology of protocols on one hand and the abject body on 
the other. Dependent (co)-origination can also be related to Indra's Net 
and the relation of the Net to the Internet as a collocation of nodes, at 
least on an epistemological level.

One might ask what is the ontology of SL from _within_ protocols - and 
whether such a question makes any sense at all. 

To self-active an SL avatar - use the screen itself as vision, motion- 
detection across the image - feed this into AI neural networks - output 
back into SL through encoded behaviors. Note the ontological and epis- 
temological shifts involved: from digital readout through analog screen 
(2D) interpretation.

Finally there are the old MOOs - MUDs-object-oriented, where MUDs stood 
for multi-user-dungeon (or some such - out of the old D&D gaming). MOOs 
are text-only virtual realities, somewhat similar to SL. One of the 
biggest differences: MOOs are open-source and can easily be set up on any 
linux/unix box. Now MOOs (like SL) have a system of unique identification 
tags for every object, player, etc., and this is hierarchical (much like 
unix itself, with the root / ). Explore the earliest numbers (which re- 
flect the sysadmins, wizards, MOO structure as a whole. Remap through 
dependent (co)-origination. (It should be noted that the Sharp Zaurus, 
which runs on embedded but easily terminal-accessible linux, has a file 
structure which 'resonates' with itself - one can literally go in circles 
through it. How can one think through these dependencies, proxies, etc.?) 
This might be a way of clarifying the philosophical issues - for example, 
one might think of both absolute and relative ontologies (much like URLs) 
- and then how the former maps onto the latter, or how all of this dis- 
appears. (Just as things disappear, mathematical objects appear to appear. 
So problems related to SL and avatars: the mapping of protocols, networks 
in relation to the visual; to mathesis and abstract ontologies; and to 
hardware implementations: static (ROM or storage where configuration is 
mapped thing that is read as virtual thing), and dynamic (where transmis- 
sion dynamics, ontologies, and economies are paramount).

To code is not to produce codework; it is to produce code on the level of

irreversible spew of cellular automata is codework, all the better if the 
rules are noisy. The cultural production of codework abjures 
intensifications, strange attractors, descriptions such as this (which is 
the oldest game in the book). The hunt and reception of short-wave number 
codes is codework. Writers on the edge are circumscribed by codework, 
malfunctioned psychoanalytics, scatologies endlessly coded and decoded; 
the codes are dissolute, partial, always already incomplete: the differend 
is codework.

Flying Saucers over Clarksburg, West Virginia

I photographed these flying saucers (there seem to be two types??) over 
Clarksburg, West Virginia, in the north-central sector of the state. A 
slight amount of detail is visible. Clarksburg is known as the hometown of 
Gray Barker, who was first visited by "the men in black" - he was also the 
first to write about this top-secret government organization. The saucers 
were silent, propelled by a new kind of drives which relies on elements 
and physical principles unknown to modern science.

I photographed these wooden and plaster models (there were two types) as 
they were thrown vertically in Clarksburg, West Virginia. These were made 
by Barker himself and were a prototype for many of the flying saucer ima- 
ges from the 1950s-60s. Barker created the concept of "the men in black," 
as well as secret letters purported to originate with the US government, 
which encouraged the saucerian movement.

The Sondheim effect*

Working with film twenty years ago, I discovered that if stereographs 
(which are mostly late 19th-early 20th century photographs viewed through 
a stereoscope, giving the viewer a three-dimensional image) were rephoto- 
graphed on movie film, alternating left and right - upon projection, a 
three-dimensional effect was clearly visible, even though both eyes 
perceived the left and right viewpoint. In traditional stereoscopy, the 
left eye perceives the left-taken image, and the right perceives the 
right-taken one. In other words the three-dimensionality is synchronic- 
ally, spatially, encoded and the mind reconstitutes the scene. In the 
Sondheim effect, the encoding is diachronic; both eyes perceive both 
images in quick (16-24 fps) alternation. The result should be 'something' 
like a back-and-forth shuddering, which does occur, but it is accompanied 
by a three-dimensional illusion which has varying degrees of depth, 
depending on the original image - clear foreground/background information 
tends towards the greatest illusion. 

(It's been pointed out many times that it's possible to create depth by 
watching a soccer game, for example, with a slightly dark neutral density 
filter over one eye. This creates a small processing lag, so each eye 
processes at a different rate, hence is reading slightly different images 
from the playing field. Now if the ball moves horizontal- ly, it's seen 
simultaneously in two different positions, against a more or less constant 
background, and appears, again slightly, to jump out from the screen.)

In three-dimensional unpacking, the mind fills in synchronic or diachronic 
digital information - discrete images - to recreate the plenitude of the 
real, in a sense 'being there.' Think of this as a gestural operating - 
given limited information, filling in the blanks, as if vision were active 
(which it is) and gestural, as if vision originated primarily from the 
perceiver. (This is clear in vision studies, the work of Marr decades ago, 
color vision theory, etc.) 

Since the analogic is fundamentally continuous, 'of the real,' it might 
also be considered, in this case (and the case of color theory etc.) a 
kind of suture or bandaging - what are really, inherently, disparate 
images - either from photographs or from perception of physical reality - 
are combined into a simulacrum of a continuum of spatial depth. Stereo- 
graphs are an example of a production involving simultaneity (space); 
alternation is an example involving succession (time). This is of course 
far too neat and I'm positive would break down on the cog-psych or neuro- 
physiological level. So the Sondheim effect in this regard is nothing more 
than a curiosity, the sort of thing one might read in Mind Hacks. On the 
other hand, the idea that succession can imply a re-reading or reconsti- 
tution of simultaneity has interesting phenomenological implications, as 
anyone familiar with Husserl on internal time-consciousness knows. The 
following video has the _slightest_ Sondheim effect among the runners; and 
even when trying, I've never been able to get the sharpness necessary to 
reproduce it in video at all. Now with HD, it should be easy to do and it 
would be interesting to see the results of a complete narrative movie 
presented in such a manner - would the shuddering finally become invisible 
as vision synchronized itself to temporal collapse?

http://www.asondheim.org/roughrace.mp4

* Of course, naming the effect after me quickly gives way to the realiza- 
tion that there must be thousands of experimental studies of just such 
things; it's more than obvious. Viewing alternations is standard in lang- 
uage and motion studies; the only difference here is that the alternating 
images are from slightly different viewpoints.
