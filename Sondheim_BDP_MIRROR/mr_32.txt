i am stuck in my body. i am stuck in my mind.
i am stuck in my body. i am stuck in my mind.
nothing can help this self. you would not know this self.
this self is a stupid dirty thing. you would not talk to it
unless you were told to talk to it. then you would say.
hello self. i understand you are brilliant and very clever.
you would be under the burning eyes of this self. you would
be stuck in talking. this self would make you a friend. 
you would be stuck in friend. you would know self.
