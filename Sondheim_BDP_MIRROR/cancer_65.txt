"every third beat of my heart"


i wrestled with the angels julu and jennifer
every third beat of my heart
wrestled with the angels and placing the world
in a bag twisted and tied at two ends
in a bladder canteen
in the moment of truth
every little twist of my heart
they bowed down before us julu and jennifer
in white robes did they bow down
every third beat of my heart
they filled the white pillars with song
filled the white rafters with song
every third beat of my heart
i knew the messages and the answers of angels
knew the songs of those in white robes
wrestled with julu and wrestled with jennifer
momentous occasions and placing the universe
every little beat of my heart
every third beat of my heart

that the every third beat went from one to the other
that the every third beat skipped from one to the other
that laces twined sinuously from julu to jennifer
every little beat of my heart
every third beat of my heart
