BLOOD-TORN FINGERS ON THE HOME-BOARDS





My fucking arms are hollowed out, blood tendrils reaching towards the

central bone-core, flesh shreds hanging organelles, dark tunnels of

shattered nerves. This is the case of violent contusions, bandaged

wrists, the case of scarred wrists, faces bruised with longing - 



Words splinter against broken teeth, tongue-deaths. The keel tilts. 

When the arms go the words go, mouth collapses down, fucks down, 

dance cheek to cheek. Nothing to say because of the meat of it. It 

is the meat that speaks to us and the meat that responds. Too much of

it. Hearing too fucking much of it.



Better to enter RANDOMIZATION PROGAM PROTOCOL, better begin PHONEMIC

COMBINATION. Here _sack,_ the oldest word, SHOULDERS meaning carried

across the stain of broken limbs. Here _GaL-GaL_ turns, splayed open and

over with the revolution of ligaments torn from their moorings. KEEL 

DOWN!



IRON GASH creases the forehead; I can't THINK THINKING, think past the

MARY JESUS PROTOCOL think past THE ANY OTHER, language B++ or PROTOCOL.

My temperature levels out, 112 degrees OR ANY OTHER. 

Nothing keeps me going. Images jag constantly, out of control - 

winds and holocausts, MALE AND FEMALE SACKS AND WHEELS, strokes of 

violent lightning. COLD COUGH travels the length of the throat, lodges 

itself in the presence of a naked girl and boy. My legs are on fire.

I BURN ALIVE!



My hands weaken; I can't hold anything up, just like my cock flares and

torches, just like flames emerge, crowning the nipples, eye-sockets. 

NEITHER CAN I SPEAK THE WORD OF THE LORD. NOR CAN I TESTIFY.



Squalls flow through me, TORRENTS shear the chest into an enormous

PROTOCOL WOUND, flooded with you and do you bring me into your arms with 

PROTOCOL LABIA NIPPLES 

YOUR ARMS STRONG ENOUGH FOR THE STRONGEST KEYS ON THE BOARD 

YOUR ARMS TATTOOED WITH ADDRESSES DIRECT AND INDIRECT

YOUR PROTOCOL ARMS 

STRANGLEHOLD ARMS 

HOPELESS ARMS



Shunt into the nineteenth-century train station. Shunt into the funnel-

stack on the top of the locomotive, long-haul motivation, intention of

the absolute. Say Manchester, 1844. 

Hopeless arms and the angel of death 

hopeless arms and the angel of death: 

CUT YOUR LIPS IN MY THROAT NOMENCLATURE 

CUT MY THROAT ON MY THROAT RECOGNITION

BURN ME ALIVE NOMENCLATURE PROTOCOL



My arms suffer from the railroad tunnel! My arms suffer from the smoke-

stack sparks, suffer from the impediments of the hollow ligament carry-

ing NO weight holding NO sign! Beyond the arms the throat blocks itself!

Beyond the throat the fingers curl in, collapse, foetus-hands, embryo

arms and embryo legs!



I AM ALWAYS ALREADY NOTHING

ALWAYS ALREADY NOTHING BEYOND THE REACH OF SHATTERED ARMS



NEITHER CAN THE BLOOD SPLINTER: 

NEITHER CAN THE BLOOD SPLINTER ALOUD:

ABYSS! ABYSS!

END AND BEGINNING OF THE PHALLACY OF JOURNALISM 101
