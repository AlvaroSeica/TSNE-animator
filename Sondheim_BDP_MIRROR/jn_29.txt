*<Alan>: Can you see me, Jennifer?
*<Alan>: Jennifer, can you see me?
*<Alan>: Jennifer, are you there?
*<jennifer>: i can see you
*<jennifer>: 
*<Alan>: I can't see you at all...
*<jennifer>: i'm trying to figure out why i'm not sending.
*<Alan>: You're listed here as a lurker. Are you still on?
*<Alan>: How is my image, Jennifer?
*<Alan>: You might have to check on a send-video image...
*<Alan>: Jennifer, I mean option -
*<Alan>: Something just appeared - it's your screen - there you are!!!
*<jennifer>: i don't know what's going on.
*<Alan>: Can you still see me? You seem slightly bleached out and frozen.
*<Alan>: Now you moved...
*<Alan>: Now you look better, Jennifer.
*<Alan>: Now you've fractured!
*<jennifer>: i think i fixed the frozen.
*<Alan>: It's an excellent image, Jennifer!
*<jennifer>: thank you.
*<Alan>: How is mine - now you're bleached again. Now you're better again.
*<Alan>: Now you've cycled through that again. Move the camera around!
*<Alan>: Too white, Jennifer!
*<jennifer>: you're bleached too.
*<Alan>: Jennifer! Too white!
*<Alan>: Who is on the wall? What are you drinking, Jennifer?
*<Alan>: Can you still see me, Jennifer?
*<jennifer>: i'm drinking chocolate milk. the poster is sandra bullock in
the net.
*<Alan>: Jennifer, let me see more of you - I see a quarter of your
head,
that's all...
*<jennifer>: i can see you. but i need to go soon.
*<Alan>: Ah well..., now you're entirely white...
*<Alan>: Jennifer, it's hard to see what you're doing.... ah... I see...
*<Alan>: Now it's very dark, almost black...
*<Alan>: Now there's strange static on the screen...
*<jennifer>: i'm working on the lighting 
*<Alan>: Whited out... 
*<Alan>: This should be called, Jennifer: First Contact...
*<jennifer>: :)
*<Alan>: Jennifer, your screen is white, ghostlike, uncanny
*<Alan>: It's like a dream-screen or breast, imageless...
*<Alan>: Light grey shadows, icebergs, Jennifer...
*<Alan>: Vague outlines... your jacket hanging on a hook...
*<jennifer>: i can't reset the brightness for some reason
*<Alan>: Jennifer, ah, that's better...
*<Alan>: That's perfect, Jennifer, was perfect there for a second...
*<jennifer>: i should go.
*<jennifer>: talk to you later
*<Alan>:
