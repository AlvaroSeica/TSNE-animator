My quoting of text presaging the future presence of cyberspace - the
trace, filigree, found in these older works - as if disembodiment, era-
sure, effacement, distantiation, presencing, introjection and projection,
had an uneasy relationship to the future imaginary - the quotes from
everywhere and nowhere at all, magic, fetishization, unexplainable phen-
omena, all moving from the explanatory realm, hurtling towards the elec-
tronic highway, destination unknown, lanterns and ghosts, shimmering for
ests curtseying as the car disappears, the passengers holding the reins -
 

It's this kind of note that seeds a text, frames it at the level of the
curtain rod opening onto a senseless space. The space is as shallow as the
Net is shallow, not infinite information by a long shot, but selected
tropes depending upon the taste of someone carrying a book or document into
the electronic. I am aware of Ovid, the Icelandic Runic Poem, Lucan,
Kraus, Old Hittite, the Rig Veda, Manning on four-dimensional space, the 
list, irregular as can be, goes on and on. And I search for these roots, 
Barthes' writing on Japanese (which he probably got wrong) lending itself 
towards cybermind, this or that mathematics, Jabes, Bharata, Blake and 
Chatterton, all as if haunted, presaging...

And it's not that I trace these texts as historic curiosities, but instead
as a book of emblems constituting the discourse of cybermind itself, which 
did not begin with the Internet, won't end with it...

Alan, clarifying, thinking out loud -
