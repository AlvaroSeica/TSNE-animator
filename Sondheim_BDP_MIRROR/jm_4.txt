It's not the prism of sex, it's not the prism of anything. If you're into
sex, it's the prism of sex. If you're into transport, look there, or if
alchemy, equivalent; it's a double x-ing of devices; nothing looks at any-
thing except through desire, prosthetics, neutral. 

It's a stake to say sex, not a steak.

It's not a prism; it's a potential field, disrupted manifold fuzzy and
convoluted at the edges. Nothing is ordered, no seriality. Look at it
through anything and there is your definition.

I think it's this information.
