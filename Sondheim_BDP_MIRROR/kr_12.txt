/* Julu therefore is an _extrusion_ of Alan.Jennifer interpenetration. The
class becomes Applet.Class.Julu which is self-reflexive, i.e. its methods
are self-applicable only. Note that the entire object may be inserted
within any communicative domain, within which it may split, bifurcate or
coalesce. The Applet.Class.User is therefore _inherently unstable,_ and
overly responsive (i.e. positive feedback) to local and global environ-
mental factors. */
