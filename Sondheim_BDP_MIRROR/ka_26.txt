"Your subtitle is _Essai sur l'abjection._ How would you translate the
term _l'abjection_ into English?"

"It may be impossible. _L'abjection_ is something that disgusts you, for
example you see something rotting and you want to vomit - it is an ex-
tremely strong feeling that is at once somatic and symbolic, which is
above all a revolt against an external menace from which one wants to
distance oneself, but of which one has the impression that it may menace
us from the inside. The relation to abjection is finally rooted in the
combat that every human being carries on with the mother. For in order to
become autonomous, it is necessary that one cut the instinctual dyad of
the mother and the child and that one becomes something other."

(Elaine Hoffman Baruch's interview with Kristeva in Kristeva, Interviews.)

Everything belongs to me, says Jennifer, "you can't get rid of me so eas-
ily." She knows the pain of the attempt. Alan writhes in pain, her hands
claw through his breasts, mouth tackling the concave interior of the nip-
ple. There's always screaming, tinnitus, in his ear: it's her. Julu's on
the other hand, her breasts pushing out through his hands, distending,
soaking his electronic nightmare, shorting out. He succumbs, they grapple.
The mother's the air, the breath, in and out; Jennifer says "he holds his
breath, you see." He can't do that for long, but he gets help; Jennifer
and Julu grab lungs, diaphragm, wedge arms and elbows between ribs. He'd
scream, but there's a leg in the throat, vomit-slithered. They won't let
him die, says Julu, "so we won't die either."
