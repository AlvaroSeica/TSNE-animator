building avatar dream 
i'm lying there the cameras loud on me
avam, it's towards the end, i'm falling
avam, i'm taking them with me, i made them
avam, they're taking me with them, they made me
THEY STRETCHED IT OUT AND MADE ME

o julu twine of the leaving world

http://www.alansondheim.org/o.mp4 leaving the world, the long slow music 
digitized, hands removed from things, fleeing away, carrying emptiness 
which has always existed, the exhaustion of the world left behind -
no virtual, no virtual beyond, the labor lost once the thing sets into 
motion, but the labor of capital, ceaselessly drawing and redrawing, 
ceaselessly withdrawing, the vacancy filled by illumination, they have 
never been mine, they will never be mine, there and already probably 
disappearing, somewhere off world and worlds, sometimes returning to 
inventory and the production of accountancy, enumeration, sometimes 
unraveled, forgotten...

the frame, after the last frame, the frame

tiny interior of the womb of hir dancing
all of these need nothing but image and sound, flesh and voice
none need compensators, linguistic anchors
states of minds, operators across virtual bodies
try and again i make the situation of my life
a slip would ruin everything, there are no slips
severing the links of memberment
joining the links of dismemberment, prims have no memory
when was someone here, when did someone do this
when has someone left, why are we always in mourning
s-he cannot move a frame more, nor would s-he
s-he has always already disappeared, s-he already taken out
as if to something, some event, s-he has gone, left us
there was nothing on the other side of the hill
there was no other side, there was no hill
s-he did not know that i did not know that, you did not know that
what we know we do not know
what we know is nothing, and we do not know nothing
the frame after these frames, o loss
not knowing loss, our mouths open to skies
no words, nothing emergent
frame, no glimmer of light, a dark matter
darker matter, frameless

dead origin

 For the thinking of the educated man of our time land surveying is a 
 _dead origin._ (Suzanne Bachelard, Phenomenology and Mathematical
 Physics)

the dead origin, the arbitrary dead-point of orthogonal or otherwise 
disjoint vectors, Weyl's ego-vestige, yet an irradiation of emptiness 
whose ratio to mass-length tends towards zero - there's a joy here, in 
absence, in a wilderness of the discrete and infinitely small, as if 
nothing remained.

the dead origin is a _closed set_; what opens - tendrils - opens from 
without, but so close, so intimate! implanted life is that edge of the 
urge at lip or nub, an urge generated by the universal constitution of 
biochemistry in this particular cosmos.

the dead origin is the memory of memory, memory which grows, striations, 
among the tendrils, primordial coding of what would be constituted as 
events, histories, origins.

'i could go on, but why bother? nothing touches the detumescent, nothing 
reaches beyond this anti-punctum, manque or the loss of idea. i shall 
inhabit the future anterior of the subjunctive, having already received 
your reply.'
