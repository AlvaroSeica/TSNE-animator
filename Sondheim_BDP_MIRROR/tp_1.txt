subsequently sounds. recorded 3 meters away. i eat berries.

roles while a foghorn sounds, now, in the distance, on a nova 
scotia winter night, recording a foghorn and its echoes, here
in rhode island, an impossible day 

on the time when a rare appearance in these parts of harlequin 
ducks, living in rough and stormy weather, waters, our first 
sightings in nova scotia, and here

a commensurate moment among rock, bay and eternity, brief moment 
of organisms, medieval instrument playing among the fog and wind,

and later, the categories and topos of the world, solidity lost
later among the violence of our species, but not for a moment,

As geographers, Sosius, crowd into the edges of their maps parts 
of the world which they do not know about, adding notes in the 
margin to the effect, that beyond this lies nothing but the 
sandy deserts full of wild beasts, unapproachable bogs, Scythian 
ice, or a frozen sea, so in this work of mine, in which I have 
compared the lives of the greatest men with one another, after 
passing through those periods which probable reasoning can reach 
to and real history find a footing in, I might very well say of 
those that are farther off: "Beyond this there is nothing but 
prodigies and fictions, the only inhabitants are the poets and 
inventors of fables; there is no credit, or certainty any 
farther."

Uncanny Worlds of Dimensions among Open Sets

http://www.alansondheim.org/ghosttracks3.jpg

Falling asleep, insomniac, hysteric-depressive, coming into
play and form, I work among uncanny objects, misted spaces;
ghosttracks1, continuous paths among octahedra and other shapes
in which upper and lower polygons are connected by triangles,
how to do this among them, examples octahedra, beautiful paths
and side tracks; ghosttracks2, continuous octahedron tracking
with bypassing, side tracks as if afterthoughts, towards an
otherwise incomprehensible view, these circulations continuing
night after night, polyhedra glimmering across nebulae, the
faintest glimmer of stars; ghosttracks3, the most elaborate,
sets of dimensions 0, 1, 2, 3, each sweeping across the next
highest, i.e. n sweeps n+1, each half an n-sphere whose 
n-1 boundaries are closed, whose n boundaries are open,
a point and then a ray, a ray and then an open disk, a lune
and then a half-sphere, object with only one each of 0, 1, 2,
3, flats bounded by n-1 disks, of all elements only 4, cuts 
and slice, interiors and exteriors, the breathings of open 
sets, beating of closed boundaries from the sides of them, as
if there were bridges to cross, one each of everything in the
world that is the world; and there are other, more complex
shapes and dimensional constructs, where were we in the fogs,
so many ghosts and tracks, slippages, memories, instrusions
as of quartz among phyllite, and the memories of quartz and
phyllite, calming, luster, indescribable sheen, hypnagogic,
memories of childhoods among nebulae and the birth of stars

"One important such verb is VRT (I VARTATE), literally
'turn, revolve,' ('turn' in transitive sense is expressed
by the causative VARTAYATI). It is common in such 
meanings as 'proceed, be current' and thus often trans-
ates 'be, exist' in an 'active' as opposed to a stative
sense, particularly where the subject is an abstract 
noun. [...] [Oh, repulsiveness is going on in front:]
What ghastliness is before me!" - from Sanskrit: An
Introduction to the Classical Language, Michael Coulson,
1992, p. 133 (caps mine).

Yes, Alan again, o woe is me, etc. I'm considering giving up 
music; almost no-one listens, online and offlinethere are no 
reviews, people here pretty much hate it, we're working in a 
total vacuum where the response is 'this stuff isn't to my 
taste,' the resulting depression and self-hatred is getting to 
me, practicing seems hopeless, many of the instruments have to 
be constantly tended. My life is 'again, again,' and anyway 
giving up is entertaining and

up too. +b One is unwilling to give up the primacy of the

Coleridge - perhaps I should give up art altogether - at least 
this THIS give up... turn away...something has gone horribly 
wrong... perhaps this:

One is unwilling to give up the primacy of the physical because 
of its immensity. It is difficult, even from a platonic 
viewpoint, to comprehend the immensity of the abstract as well - 
it pales by comparison. As for consciousness, it seems the 
weakest of all, certainly the most fragile. It is within 
consciousness that the annihilation and creation of historical 
memory occur.

Mayakovsky says, Nora, you've just got to give up things. 
There's no way I it's going to be that way if you don't give up

is to give in to the text, to _follow_ the Estate, and to what 
extent would I want to give up the paraphrase for the theory, 
the apparatus. And while I don't give up in this space, I give 
up for the distance, give up to the distance, which can seem 
insurmountable, Oh I give up! give up no response, to open

The poset in situ.

The pose is drawn out of the dynamics; the spectator, in the 
purposes. The pose is the ridge or hinge of movement, the pause 
or victim of seizure. Every pause is a pose, every pose a pause, 
both given as a gift, for the other, oriented; the orientation 
of the pose defines the stance of the other in inverse 
relationship considering the locus of the viewer as well. 
Tiffany cries "That is not art! Hold the pen/write, pose your 
hands above your head just like that, hold it, viola and 
violin!" And then exhaustion, air-bones, some with a certain 
image, some move on. And then hour after hour in a useless 
posltion, and in photogniphy the pose is everything, so I - I, I 
take a pose and hold it for you; I release it the body moves

spread, lying back looking at the birth of stars, like a thinner 
membrane, breath. you feel your body spread out everywhere 
across the desert, you in time. you will know all real war-time

2. perception and thereby repressed, spread across yet more 
language, and across the social, always opaque rooms or beneath 
trees where canopies spread everywhere, waiting, tremulous green 
sward. listen, i keep trying to spread the word and call you, 
the diasporic spread of humans fearful of themselves. neither 
men nor women have spread legs or other in/attentive views; 
cancers spread like pools of artificial life across desperate 
thought and the end of the lines, which spread from a; there may 
be skeins of interiors spread like paste between us. we wear our 
clothing until it waves towards the state, spread over space and 
time, specificity of value; it's measure words, they spread out, 
the loudspeaker like indirect lightning spreads the word. and 
they spread out constellations, line up the measure words, and 
they spread out cold, come gone heat, so much crying, stress, 
bombing, in these parts

3. depression, lists, rage spread, planes spread out, grids
widen, less and less corners, suffocated; when i think of 
myself, i think of me lazily spread out across all the trace

4. the texture spread everywhere, 
that split me open, spread me; i turn crust, 
spread like a stain, modalities collapsing into one another,
kill us before we spread across the earth,
towards the past, spread like an eddy or delta, 
because the past can rip us open
