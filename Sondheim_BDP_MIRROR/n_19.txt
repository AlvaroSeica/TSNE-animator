The Internet Text (periodic notice)


This is a somewhat periodic notice describing my Internet Text, available
on the Net. The work to date is divided into two sections: the Internet
Text proper, and the alphabetic text; together they would fill more than 
two megs, and constitute around 1000 pages total. The Text was started
more than a year ago, and has continued as an extended meditation on cy-
berspace. It begins with a somewhat straightforward theoretical approach,
and then, calling on numerous ghosts (alive, quasi-alive, and dead),
continues into the domains of psychoanalysis, interiority, subjectivity,
narrativity, and so forth. My current writing, more distant in some
aspects, nevertheless references back into the strata of the whole/hole, a
work which for me is an entering into future issues of cyberspace and
subjectivity in the next millennium. 

The changing nature of these email lists, cybermind and fiction-of-philos-
ophy, hides the full textual body itself, since new readers will not be
aware of its presence. For them the text appears fragmentary, created 
piecemeal, splintered from a non-existent whole.

So this (periodic) notice is an attempt to recuperate the work as a whole,
retard its diaphanous existence. And below is the introduction, updated.
