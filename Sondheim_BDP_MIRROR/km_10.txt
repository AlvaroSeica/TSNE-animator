The Demon


The Demon divides the real from the virtual, the real from the real; the
virtual divides by means of the _device-random,_ always already a seed or
a promulgation. Thus the virtual is traceable, at least in the common
parlance; the real is deeply untraceable: lost from the lost. Divisions
fissure into divisions; continuum produces the apparent smoothness of lost
histories, clutters.

The real has always lost itself. The virtual is always in the process of
losing.
