Parable


Nikuko passed a man and a woman who had received a message from the spirit
realm; she turned them into two sand cones, that the message be dispersed
among the worlds. Izanagi passed three sand-cranes fighting among them-
selves for food scrabbled upon the beach; he turned them into three logs
for the festival, that they slide down steep slopes, crushing men beneath
them. Nikuko and Izanagi watched two children grow and marry, and two more
children appear as a result; they transformed the parents into two large
wooden balls, that men may fight over them, carrying them together at the
festival. Nikuko transformed a tree which had outlasted Yamato into a
tower, precarious-leaning and never-falling; Izanagi transformed the eye
of a morbid dragon into Lake Biwa. It was from the reflection of a shell
that Nikuko created the sky, and from the creature within, that Izanagi
created the breathing of the earth. From Nikuko, Izanagi made Nikuko, and
from Izanagi, Nikuko made Izanagi; at the festival there are two sand
cones in commemoration.
