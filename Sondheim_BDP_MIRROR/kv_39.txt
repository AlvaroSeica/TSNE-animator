alone and late at night, i download images of naked men and women
i send the images into corel draw, corel design, corel trace
they motivate
perhaps they are you and me, they are so intimate, so revealing
i send them into gws, corel capture, corel photo
areas and objects blurred, edges smeared, involuted
multiples, bifurcations, effacements, prosthetics, rhizomes,
 vaginas and penises, nipples and eager faces
everything is achievable
colors are embossed, posterized, gamma and hue changed
motion blurs are everywhere, except for the central plateaus
there, roots set in, tendrils, outlining a face
it is your face there, summoning me, it is my face there, 
 summoning you
feverishly, we continue to work on the photographs
they display the sense of a human hand, labor caressing the forms
the forms are melded, disappearing into flows and floods
except for the central plateaus, organs coupling, invaginations
our bodies are funneled into thin air
we have known every moment of the lens of the camera
we are greedy; we refuse to stop there, at the moment of capture
our limbs are sent akimbo, straining at the edges of the frame
our body circulates, enveloping simulacra of nothing
who is that nothing, swirling around limbs akimbo
multiple vaginas open across limbs, shadowed deep within them
penises split and measure the length of an eye to an object
the imaginary forces itself from the image, hovering
'the sleep of reason reproduces monsters' (i make you here)
we drive touch into the picture, the mouse moving over labia
the mouse outlining the pleasure of glistening skins and membranes
we drive pressure, rearranging limbs, plateaus at will
aroused, we find you hungered everywhere in the glistening membranes
we, we, we, our trembling hands, we drive each other, 
 over and over again (i make you here internal)
fantasms envelop us, until we are bereft of skins, our membranes
 the very air we breath, breathless, screens fogged with transformed
 organs swallowed hole
