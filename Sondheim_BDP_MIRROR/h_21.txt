[8m reading this brings you closer to me, ignoring the symbols, running

[8m towards the fallow ground where i lie waiting for you, not everyone

[8m sees this for your eyes only, older eyes, eyes of millennia, my legs

[8m splayed open waiting for your arrival, head thrown back in ecstasy

[8m here in cyberspace we are alone, here we come together testing

[8m the purity of love, my breasts are hard, swollen with the thought of

[8m you, my nipples hard, erect, my mouth wide and laughing, my eyes full

[8m of tears, there is nothing, darling, in the world, beyond the two of

[8m us in this dark writing, so visible to ourselves, so invisible to 

[8m the rest of them, as if a giant curtain has falling, as if the world

[8m had just begun the written, signs and symbols only for origination,

[8m only used once, and then to be discarded for the purposes of humans

[8m themselves, women and men absorbing signs already finished, used-up,

[8m already in a state of defuge... things worry themselves in constancy

[0m through the dark kingdom where nothing shines and brilliant where

[8m i am pure, naked, cleansed, splayed, aroused, waiting, breathing, 

[8m grown old with age and desire, for you, for you, for you, for you, 

[8m for you[0m
