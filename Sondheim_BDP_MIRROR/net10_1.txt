FRAME \ TO CUT A FRAME

Lost in the world of lower ascii, I sink into the depths of lobotomy, 
praying for a cut, final or otherwise, separating myself from myself; 
only then, like Odin, could I hang and, procure the runes, something at
last for myself, a circumscription from _Voluspa,_ Derrida:

|_____                                                  Kantian question: 
the relation of the concept to the nonconcept (up/down, left/right), to 
the body, to the signature which is placed "on" the frame: in fact, 
sometimes; structurally, always. The prothesis                    _____

which _leans_ within the sublimation of _ecriture,_ from _My So-Called 
Life,_ ABC: "I like the way he leans" the conveyance (Voyager busline, 
Montreal) of one text en passant (B and Q/D lines hurtling towards the 
Manhattan Bridge, New York City), or _convergence._

When will the _suture_ cure the abridgement of consciousness I seek? To 
cleanse _desire_ itself, automated-pilot of automatic desire: "The same 
argument will apply, [...] to the automatic pilot. If it is a good 
regulator, the passengers will have a smooth flight whatever the 
gustiness outside. Thus a good pilot acts as a barrier against the 
transmission of that information." (W. Ross Ashby, _An Introduction to 
Cybernetics._) Interior slaughter continues production-without-alienation; 
no Sartrean machinery continues the prescience of desire. The unconscious 
tranverses the root directory or operating system.

_I no longer take responsibility for my actions._ Blind, I destroy 
objects in order to master them, violate myself in order to transform 
into the _substrate of the written._ I cannot proceed without _breakdown._
Flaming against myself, I transform language into charred flesh; pressed 
against the confinement of lower ASCII, writing screams against the 
simplest image, that of the frame. But the frame contains nothing except 
the symbolic.

[Consider the symbolic a disease of the mind, the inability to comprehend 
without bracketing and stipulation. No wonder we cannot recognize animal 
intelligence; confined to the bracket, humans _require_ mediated represe- 
sentation, apply the Hegelian concept to the world (which becomes a 
"world of facts, not things") and find it wanting.]

_What is within the brackets is without the brackets._

I have been _framed._

"The Socratic effort to communicate with strangers is, in reality, the 
effort not to rationally certify the existing Athenian republic but to 
found an ideal republic of universal communication - a city maximally 
purged of noise." (Alphonso Lingis, _The Community of Those who have 
Nothing in Common._)

When I stop writing I will die. "Yeah, I don't have to worry about money 
anymore. And you don't have to take care of me. I'll be good for two or 
three hundred a _night!_ Do you believe it?" (Nancy Spungen in Deborah 
Spungen, _And I Don't Want To Live This Life._)

"But I am a child of the future, filled with wonder. [...] These poor 
truths, weak truths, are the only possible ones. Worlds lie shattered, 
chaotic or noisy. I find myself embarrassed or shameful." (Alan Sondheim in 
_Uncontrollable Bodies._) 

The cut is complete; the cut is always already an inscription: LOWER ASCII!!!
