--So what produces it?
<I don't know, Julia.>
--And you're sure as you read this, you're writing this?
<Someone is. It's incomplete as it occurs, and it's an occurrence. It's 
programmed - just beyond your peripheral vision, just out of sight, the 
very next line.>
--I'm saying what I'm saying. This was written altogether, I'm sure, the
two of us entwined like lovers. Said in one breath by one person. Unsaid
by the reader, said by the writer, read by the reader, written by the
writer.
<Julia, no, I stretch myself, there. It's as if I moved to the body, to
an emote on the MOO or a /me on IRC.>
--Technique, always you quote technique, these letters refreshed at the 
least thirty times a second, most likely twice that. Those that are pre-
sent. Those that are accounted for. As you write them, one by one.
<I'm not writing, you're not writing. We're entwined with our lover, you,
the reader. You are writing us together. You are programmer inadvertent;
you are necessity. We're coming through you, coming through loud and 
clear.>
--The mastery of programming, it doesn't exist. These are just words; 
it's as if they've fallen, they fell from somewhere. I turn to you, I 
fasten myself upon you.
<You fascinate me.>
--I fascinate you, turn myself inside-out, turn myself in to you. The 
reader overhears us. We've spoken these words already; we've spoken them
long ago.
<No, just as the sun sets here, invisible, so that the reader writes the
course of the sun, so does the reader continue to write us, thanks to the
programming, the programming written by someone else, in a language too
written elsewhere, and long ago, on these machines built overseas, in
countries invisible, in workrooms assembled, half-darkness, shrouded...>
--I love you.
<I love you too, Julia.>
--And I am glad, I am glad for you.
<These are open, please continue
