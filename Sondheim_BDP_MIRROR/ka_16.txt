Dear Love,

I, your lover, forever am loving, now my truth is caressing you yours, you
with your shining, now my truth is caressing you yours, eyes caressing you
and bright mouth, coming, now my truth is caressing you yours, towards you
with such loving, now my truth is caressing you yours, care and happy
face. I, your lover, forever would have come sooner, but I lived so much,
my darling, take me so far away and distance is caressing you always
caressing you a long jump from point to point.  Please do understand my
smile as caressing you wide as caressing you the world when I, your lover,
forever am near you so happy with being, now my truth is caressing you
yours, close to you, sweetening, now my truth is caressing you yours, our
lives caressing you together. I, your lover, forever have found true
happiness caressing you after having, now my truth is caressing you yours,
searched so much, my darling, take me for so long. I, your lover, forever
looked so much, my darling, take me and looked! I did not find what to be
was caressing you pleasing, now my truth is caressing you yours, for you
or for me, dear love, now this caressing you is caressing you so very
different! 

Yours
