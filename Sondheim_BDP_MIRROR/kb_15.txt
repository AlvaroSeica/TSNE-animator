Telegraph Hill


"Hello, Hello."
The redoubling of effort.
The valiant defenders.
The stalwart citizens.
The militant heroes.
Meanwhile
The homefires burning.
Everyone does his duty.
The emblazoned sun.
The flag held high.
Meanwhile
The roaring factories.
"There go our men."
The wheels of commerce.
"Daddy I can hear you."
