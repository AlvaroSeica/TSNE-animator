peter, what is equivalent is mindless, as death is spawn, tidal bloom.

kagi, cloning transforms with the environment into negations and 
disparities. what one fears is submerge, not into the maternal, but into 
the substance of the gulag or tattooed holocaust.

jim, there is no source in equivalence. without source, negation may just 
as well continue with the same.

labx, think of the mass-man and massification of the 1950s. think of the 
inconceivable, a landscape without eyes, without point-of-view.

alan, it's that last that tends towards identity. viewpoint confounds 
identity; already a doubling is split by space-time or instantiation.

kevin, identity remains ideal life. it is from identity that the false 
identification of freedom originates.

simon, one or another is always bound by death; there is no equivalence in 
death, only in its memory.

alan, the name is always a disruption; the tombstone or memoir disrupt 
equivalence, an absolute universe of non-disposition.

sam, the evil of language is thus the establishment, within identity, of 
ethos and discrimination. the two common senses of the latter shade into 
each other; to discriminate is to judge; to judge is to decree; to decree 
is to choose; to choose is to punish.

stephen, it is in the comfort of mindlessness, beyond substance, that the 
myth and fixture of the death drive is located. mind and mindfulness, 
deployment of the self, cultivation of the other.

cambridge, thankfulness is in recognition, of the comfort, as well, of
names and words. humanity is characterized by the ability to do evil; thus
it is characterized by the ability to create and deploy it, as well.

michael, what follows, never follows, in its equivalence. equivalence 
collapses both space and time.
