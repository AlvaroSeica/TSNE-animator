SOME FASCINATING NET ARCHAEOLOGY!!


**I** Early www connection, no longer working:

{k:7} telnet info.cern.ch
Trying 137.138.24.189...
Connected to www0.cern.ch.
Escape character is '^]'.
 
 
UNIX(r) System V Release 4.0 (www0)
 
No utmpx entry. You must exec "login" from the lowest level "shell".
Connection closed by foreign host.


**II** The NSFNET Backbone Services Acceptable Use Policy 

[the original Internet backbone]

_General Principle_:

* NSFNET Backbone services are provided to support open research and educ-
ation in and among US research and instructional institutions, plus re-
search arms of for-profit firms when engaged in open shcolarly communica-
tion and research. Use for other purposes is not acceptable.

[...]

_Unacceptable Uses_:

* Use for for-profit activities, unless covered by the General Principle
or as a specifically acceptable use.

* Extensive use for private or personal business.


**III** Meanwhile, on anonymous ftp to info.cern.ch (www site):

pub is supposed to point to mnt/afs/w3.org/ftp/pub .
 
However, as this doesn't allow anymous incoming info,
I disabled this for the moment. It should be back like
this as soon as anonymous users can write to AFS file
in a secure mode.

**IV** And finger @address still works for some places:

{k:16} finger @cleo.murdoch.edu.au

**V** Best of all, the rtfm.mit.edu still works, albeit not updated! Here
is the automated result of a search:

[Only the first address is good. Mail was sent to: 
mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu and the text stated:  send
usenet-addresses/sondheim . You can also get a HELP
file for a list of other commands and services.]


**VI** Finally, here is the result of typing telnet internic.net:

potential, active; I researched another group over a year ago.]
