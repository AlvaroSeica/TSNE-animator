We can picture a transformation of the internet as a membrane with dif-
fused glows across a rastered and skeined landscape, to the Internet with
points of light, clear/clean routes between them. On a basic level, this
is also the difference between postmodernism with its temporary autono-
mous zones, flows, and leakages, and modernisms with their blank facades,
filters and controls, monitors, and mediated relations beneath the signs
of capital and intellectual property.
