Travis looked around her. "This is the being that banged drums," she said,
"much." She said, "Nothing's ever," quietly, "changed." Truly amazing!
"They were banged at nearly equal," she added, "intervals." "They have a 
natural habit of," he murmured, "doubling."

She was surprised. "Doubling, up and down the recursive" she asked,
"tree?"  Suzie smiled back. "Yes, as if there were a," he said, "root."
"It gives them," she said, "ideas." "Ideas is all they," he added, "have." 

Unbelievable! "They still think songs start," she asked again, "some-
where?" "They have that," Suzie replied, "yes." "A species gets a drum,
and there is literally no accounting for," he added, "it." "I," Travis
replied, "see." She looked as lovely looking as Suzie, both standing near
the streaming waters gurgling across moss, stone, sandy loam, snow in the
air there.

"Travis, they can," he said, "speak." "Let it," she whispered, "be." 
"Just," with the rhythm picking up, mewling in the distance, "now." "The 
skein begins with the ending of the legend of the leaf and the twig and 
the branch and the trunk and the root and the," she continued, "tree." 
"The," Suzie said, "skein." Travis, "Yes."

"Thus it was that the surface garnered the depths, and the depths," Honey
intervened, "responded." 

Ah, all three of them, so beautiful by mountain brook, drums and waters 
merging, stormy wonder sky and lovely weather!
