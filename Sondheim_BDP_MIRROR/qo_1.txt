Some Thoughts on the Internet Text


The following pieces are culled from the Internet Text, a project I have 
been working on since 1994. Every day I write one or more sections. The 
Text examines cyberspace, being online, social media, codework, virtual 
worlds, and so forth. It uses a variety of methods and styles, ranging 
from experimental poetics to academic theory. There are also thousands of 
URLs of visual or audio files that augment the written word. Most of these 
files have been taken down (there simply isn't enough storage for all of 
them simultaneously; the Text stands on its own without them. 

At this point, the Text is probably well over twenty thousand pages. So 
the following are descriptions, culled from the past seventeen years, of 
what the whole thing is about. This (highly edited) collection is the 
foundation of a talk I'll give at the ELO (Electronic Literature Organi- 
zation), this June in Providence. I hope the material is useful to those 
who won't be there as well.
