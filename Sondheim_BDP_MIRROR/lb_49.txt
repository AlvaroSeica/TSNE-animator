she left home suddenly
she followed a man to a strange and foreign land
she lived with the man and wandered among eucalyptus and palms
strange birds assailed her tears beneath unfamiliar constellations
two suns, two moons, two earths
there were years of drought, years of plenty
trees, symmetrical, they dwelt in peace
her ancestral land, tales and ballads
meadows, ponds filled with beauty, wonder-fish, splendid mollusks
they were breathless, coral, lambs, wolves and great staghorn
new customs and clothing, lives of no regrets
a single meteor
a song
