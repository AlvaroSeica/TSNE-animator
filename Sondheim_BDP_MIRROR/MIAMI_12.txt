MIAMI


looking down:your mouth opens and closes, a fish suffocating, exhausted
gills:you're standing, you're standing on a street corner:at your
breasts:at your breasts

your lips make no sense, you're mouthing nothing: MIAMI!:they sing: MIAMI!
they sing: MIAMI!:you lift your jacket in the warm night beneath the
streetlight::you look down, your breasts, no one looks

you look down, your breasts, no one looks 
you look down, your breasts, no one looks

you're naked, turning and twisted, are you having a bad dream:
MIAMI?:seeing into you, taping your every move:you're inside the
plate-glass window, i'm on the balcony:your legs twisted you approach the
window:your legs twisted you approach the window

your legs taut, twisted you approach the window
your legs taut, twisted you approach the window

you open your mouth to speak, i can't hear you:every inch of your naked
body, you turn your head and look at me: MIAMI!:you move closer, you
see me, you move up to the window:you open your mouth, MIAMI!:

open your mouth, MIAMI! 
your dirty open mouth, MIAMI!

you'll catch too much sunburn, MIAMI!:your dress is above your waist, your
panties showing, your breasts exposed:you're lying there, thanking me,
i've taken you in:you'll catch too much sunburn, MIAMI!:you'll catch too
much sunburn, MIAMI!

too much sunburn, MIAMI! 
too much sunburn, MIAMI! 

i'm taping you, ashamed, embarrassed, the camera closes in between your
legs:i notice the wedding ring, you admit everything, you're crying, your
legs parted:now you're naked, the dress bundled around your waist:your
beautiful parted legs:your beautiful parted legs

in the heavy sun, in the dark sun, in the burned sun, in the violent
sun:you're dreaming, you're spacing out, you're thinking of whole wide
worlds:i turn away quickly, the camera searching out your face::

come home with me, in the heavy sun, in the dark sun, 
in the burned out sun,
in the violent sun!

the burned out sun, MIAMI! 
the burned out sun, MIAMI!
