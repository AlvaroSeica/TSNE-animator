NEW OLD CZECH VIOLIN AND AZURE'S NEW SONG

new old Czech violin:
we don't have heat here at the moment, playing in the cold:
carpal tunnel raises its nervous fingers:
playing through cold and pain just as the spy comes in:
truly ugly or beautiful i can't tell anymore:
but cold yes, freezing in here, not really freezing:
using what, the viola bow on the violin:
vertical and tuned GDgd as always:
i can only imagine what musicians do without heat:
without lodging and the threat of slaughter:
privileged here but still cold and still in pain:
i'm a coward and trivial, i'd never die for this:
it talks back, it talks to me:
it says, truly ugly or not, you can't tell anymore:
you can't even look in a mirror:
wracked with privileged misery, just listen to the music:
play it, then listen, then play it then listen:
think you'll learn, you'll learn nothing, you never have:
new old Czech violin, as above:

yet

beyond these three letters lies the range of possibilities hanging, from 
the slimmest thread, from the aegis of classical causality.

the patois of patios

an n-dimensional plane with its language of particles and particle 
exchange. yet lives in a cloud of probabilities, near the expression 
as-if.

as-if something happened instead of something else happening.

where yet appears: in spite of something else happening, in spite of the 
possibility of something else happening.

but not exactly in spite - something with less fervor, or something 
against which the scale of fervor is meaningless.

nearby is might as well, as if it might happen. distinctions - yet, it 
might happen no matter what - yet, it might happen as a result of - .

as a result of - causal in appearance, the germ of cultural origination.

Pipa, New York


both of these pieces interest me, moving in new directions
and after listening to Wu Man ( http://wumanpipa.org )

http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/newyork1.mp3
notes: traffic as accompaniment, traffic as interference
pipa as interference, pipa as accompaniment
finally giving traffic, city-sounds a voice, almost a holler
sound transformations: reverberation, hiss reduction, normalization

http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/almost.mp3
notes: almost a tune, struggling to find a tune
minor seconds separated by major seconds, minor thirds
i think of the tune as asymptotic, almost arriving
for some reason Simmel's stranger in the city comes to mind
sound transformations: reverberation, normalization

metropolis

not much happening here but all those unison movements in close to 
darkness were this black and white and so many years ago cut into
with bleak surgery unkind and again now elemental redistribution
here as if regrets are drawn out and how can anyone not have
remorse over everything in his or her life for none of this water
have the power to wash away sins or misrecognitions or oversights
r boorishness as if others were inconceivable in this world of 
guilt and slaughter or as if others wore the face of innocence
themselves and no longer anyone be heard

yet another strange instrument

this time a bass zither, probably american, maybe made by washburn/lyon 
and healy, has that sort of purfling. the fingerboard is troublesome, two 
of the five strings are shot. the bass strings really _are_ bass strings; 
the chord strings are also deep. the instrument is huge for a concert 
zither with a thick top and bottom. i'm still trying to get it to hold 
tune. http://www.alansondheim.org/bz1.mp3 and 
http://www.alansondheim.org/bz2.mp3 which sounds slightly like pipa. after 
i reset the action and it sounds duller, but that might be the result of 
the contact mic/amp combination; the mic is sandwiched between two pieces 
of cork beneath the instrument. there's no label. it's worth listening to 
these for the tone color, strangeness, something like five octaves to play 
around with, and strange fingering technique. lao tzu would say sounds 
leap out of sounds. that's how these pieces were intended (that's how they 
were meant to be).

things rise to the surface, or rather their glimmers, appearances, barely 
visible, as if clear delineation were muffled from world's origin.

1. clear definition is smeared across potentials and fields;
2. clear definition never existed in the first place - it's a chimera 
whose appearance is the result of a false extrapolation back from the 
surface.

like the pipa, this zither is difficult to play; what struggles to emerge 
is often occluded by error, clumsiness, stings detuning, ignorance. but 
like the pipa, clearly this instrument is filled with ghost matrices, 
baryons of all sorts, uncanny jitters' memories.

~~~ (nikuko) the ambassador is coming. you can't be naked enough.

(nikuko) i'm in your best form, the ambassador's waiting for me. he will 
take me with him. i'll have him naked before the ballet. ambassador will 
see that, he'll appreciate it, he's a man of taste.

(julu, off stage) oh god, the ambassador's dead, the whole province is
dreaming about the ambassador.

(nikuko) i'm going now, alan, the ambassador's dead, only god can bring
the ambassador back alive.

(nikuko, dancing) dear god, please bring the ambassador back alive. oh god 
help me in this and i can look up your legs. bring back my ambassador, 
resurrect him, he'll save you, he has heard so much.

(nikuko) oh god thank you, hello your ambassador, i'll do anything for you 

(continues dancing for the ambassador). (think naked Alan, naked Nikuko, 
dancing for ambassador.)

(ambassador) alan's perfect, god's a help, all's right with the world.

(applause) ambassador, everyone loves us, everyone wants us together. red 
slippers, i'll dance with god himself, you'll be my god, ambassador.

(ambassador) i'll save you, nikuko, and i'll save you too, alan.

(alan and nikuko) we thank you ambassador, and above all the whole world, 
almost as happy as the ambassador.

"above my slippers, above the flooring and the eyes of the ambassador
the ambassador would clothe me, take me from the boards of the stage and
subject: Urgent message from The Ambassador"
the ambassador says: Come back immediately. Stop fooling around.

the aambassador says: I really mean it. We need you. Stop this nonsense. 

~~~ dance with god himself, you'll be my god, ambassador, you with me and 
the whole world, almost as HAPPY as the ambassador.

Pictures of Instruments and Planets:


For anyone who might be interested, (very rough but clear) photographs of 
the instruments I've been recording with recently -

http://www.alansondheim.org/insts01.jpg - Guzheng, 16 strings with movable 
bridges. This is a folk instrument; apparently in 1961, the guzheng was 
changed - more strings were added, and the end block was set curved, not 
straight. It's really a beautiful instrument.

http://www.alansondheim.org/insts02.jpg - Pipa, weighing 8+ pounds, most 
likely rosewood body with black oxhorn frets and pegs. Tuning is Adea.

http://www.alansondheim.org/insts03.jpg, 
http://www.alansondheim.org/insts04.jpg - Violin, with a fairly wide 
(front 
to back) body.

http://www.alansondheim.org/insts05.jpg 
http://www.alansondheim.org/insts06.jpg - Viola, John Juzek, formerly 
Czech, now German, sounds really good on the low strings (I think unusual 
for a viola). I play this and the violin vertically; this is tuned CGcg 
and the violin, GDgd.

http://www.alansondheim.org/insts07.jpg 
http://www.alansondheim.org/insts08.jpg - Small Hausa raft zither, woven 
reed with seeds inside the back.

http://www.alansondheim.org/insts09.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/insts10.jpg - Larger Hausa raft zither, with a 
much deeper tone. Both instruments are plucked with both hands; both are 
somewhat old and delicate. I'll record with them, then put them aside. The 
weaving on both is amazing.

http://www.alansondheim.org/insts11.jpg - 'Bass' zither, or elegie concert 
zither. This is an anomaly; it's not that well constructed and the frets 
are crude, as is the purfling around the upper soundhole and the overall 
shape.  I'm not sure of the date; the purfling seems to be Washburn-style 
so I'm assuming it's American-made, but the ornate tuner cover (nickel or 
silver-plated) seems European. It might be English. There are 23 usable 
open strings and five playing strings; I'm using an odd tuning of my own 
devising, which also keeps the instrument from further cracking. It has a 
range of about five octaves.

Planets:

Plates of Mars and Venus from Elements of Astronomy, Illustrated with 
Plates, for the use of Schools and Academies, with Questions, by John 
Wilkins, Boston, 1832. Volumes could be written about visual interpre- 
tation (including the reading of 'canals' several decades later), about 
real and virtual phenomena in relation to optical technology, and so 
forth. Apparently this is the first American book to use 'Uranus' as the 
standard name for the planet, which had, until then, been known as 
'Herschel.'

(please give this a read.)
< finally a pipa solo with some degree of distorted mastery.
< all the techniques are new for me, borrowed from hegelung,
saz, oud, guitar, cura cumbus.
< the speed of the thing disguises the structures, which are
- more often than not - only a few seconds long.
< i'll do something that seems like a long chorus, find out
later that it might be at best a tenth of a minute.
< it's true time dilates, but never reverses.
< still things are held back, almost to a crawl, i'm usually
breathless at the end.
< it's over, as if it were, before it began. 
< listening to this, i have difficulty following it, placing
me within the lines which fragment like a particle fan.
< each particle tending towards another, splitting, vertices
and chains, tunnelings.
< and imminent breakdown of energy conservation.
< this way i forget where i was and think only of the next
few seconds, as if there were an event horizon in permanent
recession.
< it's thinking in absence, spatial stretches replacing the
fictitious linear parsing of time.
< or replacing time by its derivatives.
< requiring listening, until everything is forgotten.

if i move it won't go away

"If you don't accessorize, it never looks finished."

http://www.alansondheim.org/makeitstop.mp4

if i move it won't go away 
i can't move i have to stay very still
an old fashioned way of thinking
that it will go away

think if i were dead
that you'd have to reconstruct
from evidence distorted
making me look dead

i moved it didn't go away
but then it stopped i stopped too
it gave me gift of a chance
it didn't go away it played dead

it played dead i died
it didn't go away i'm dead


if i move it goes away

"If accessorized, it never looks finished."

http://www.alansondheim.org/windchannel.mp4
http://www.alansondheim.org/wontgetme.mp4

if i move it goes away 
i move i can't stay still
brand new thought
that it takes me there

think if i were there
you'd just have to look
clearly, and i'd look
alive and purely

i moved it went away
it went and i went too
so uplifting and all
it went away like life

it was born and me too
it went away i'm moving


the limits

when infinities are called for within the aegis of the digital, there are 
two possibilities: scatter-shots (sparse 'fit-points' appear in the graphs 
or calculations) and (fold)-catastrophic jumps connecting scatter-shots 
with vector lines or sheets. there are various combinations depending on 
the graphics program. the very act of exploring these monstrous objects 
through rotation, translation, magnification, etc. produces vibrant and 
often vibrating morphologies as the program attempts to adjust to the 
impossible. think of this as a dialog with spontaneous symmetry breaking 
between the analog (with infinities and the continuum) and digital (with 
discrete finite outcomes). finally think of this as a monolog of mind 
attempting to conceive the inconceivable, using finer and finer rasters, 
with similar and equally 'distanced' results no matter what.

[15:24] Julu Twine: this is the world that comes to mind, this insipid 
world and all its tawdry beings
[15:24] Julu Twine: a moment of thought and all is lost
[15:25] Julu Twine: and nothing returns, not even life and over the next 
horizon, nothing...
[15:25] Julu Twine: it's broken and broken and broken and broken, and 
comes forth as of death
[15:26] Julu Twine: a grey day....
[15:26] Julu Twine: emptied, unimaginable
[15:27] Julu Twine: or a thought collapsed
[15:27] Julu Twine: spewed out, the last sound i will ever hear...
[15:28] Julu Twine: ah ah ah, not here, not ever here!!!
[19:55] sensor: noone around.
[20:02] Julu Twine: quanta and sadness
[20:08] Julu Twine: thought loosens itself in the running of the world, 
thickness, thickness
[20:09] Julu Twine: more, there is nothing lost, intervals' perfection, i 
await you
[20:09] Julu Twine: more, there is nothing
[20:09] Julu Twine: lost intervals' perfection,
[20:10] Julu Twine: i await you
[20:10] Julu Twine: it stutters among sounds, what shudders if not bones
[20:11] Julu Twine: if not collapse, waves giving us this image
[20:12] Julu Twine: i hear you, speech of god
[20:13] Julu Twine: self-interaction becoming me
[20:14] Julu Twine: becoming my thinking
[20:14] Julu Twine: becoming my world
[20:15] Julu Twine: pulling up, pulling up
[20:16] Julu Twine: pulling, pulling up, mine and your as 
well.......................
[20:23] Julu Twine: i grant you these moments of utterance
[20:29] Julu Twine: it brings about...
[20:29] Julu Twine: coming itself together
[20:29] Julu Twine: overwrought, i listen
[20:30] Julu Twine: particles shuttle screen-wise, remaining placed
[20:30] Julu Twine: so slowly, they create
[20:31] Julu Twine: they create themselves
[20:31] Julu Twine: like song
[20:32] Julu Twine: of our singing, and ours,
[20:32] Julu Twine: and ours,
[20:33] Julu Twine: ours
[20:33] Julu Twine: beginning with its own carry
[20:33] Julu Twine: folding
[20:34] Julu Twine: folding and incomplete
[20:34] Julu Twine: and we, we
[20:34] Julu Twine: in silence
[20:35] Julu Twine: are

when a god speaks, there is a gap, then things coalesce, suddenly,
god speaks to me

FIRST AND SECOND 

Maria Damon and Alan Sondheim

(We spent a day making work; there are six pieces, two sets of three.
The text-based FIRST AND SECOND and SECOND AND FIRST use ytalk and
other commands; FIRST AND SECOND follows, and SECOND AND FIRST will
follow shortly. The second set, to be posted tomorrow, uses Maria's
voice and text, and my violin/viola, and pipa. The third set, to be 
posted the following day, uses Second Life. Enjoy!)
