Saint Thomas lowers his hand into the hole. Freud calls it something else.
Knives clash. Death is everywhere. Freud recoils trembling. Freud cuts his
throat. Freud calls: Men! Cut your throats! Men cut their throats. The
slits become wombs. Children flood out. Children speak:  Saint Thomas! We
love your hand! Children cry: Freud, don't be afraid! Freud cries: Men!
Cut your hearts! Men cut their hearts. Men can't be killed. Their hearts
sharpen the tips of spears. Their hearts draw blood marks in the sand. The
women come with thread. Saint Thomas cries: Women! Sew the holes! The
women sew the holes of men. The men bless the women with their swords. The
men shove their swords down everyone's throats. Freud cries: Men! Slash
your eyes! The sword comes out the asshole! Children on the tip! The women
see the children! The men see nothing!
