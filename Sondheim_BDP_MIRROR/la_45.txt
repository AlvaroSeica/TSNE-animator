Tu-lip


tu-lip was gone in the world, smoothed petals against moist skin, 
you could see the writing through them (on the skin, on the petals) 
through them you could read if-tu-lip-yes you could read if-tu-lip-no, 
bruised petals, petals of remonstrance and dissolution, 
petals thinned and wondered towards collapsing sun  
tu-lips as they are fleshed, pale, tu-lips as they are swallowed  
you want to read them, read those fleshed petal lips against yours, 
read the moisture drawn into them, crystalline stamen, you are    you are 
my crystalline stamen   you are my crystalline stamen   you are    you are
my green-stem stamen   you are my crystal green-stem   pinking

Your wet Neck is in my nice stamen
Your love seeps into my stamen - turning me tu-lip-tu-lip
something stretched open to the limit, something held in abeyance:
my thing is my pinking petal of walled up bricks:tu-lip:green-stem: 
Your pinking stamen is in my thrusting stamen and green-stem: petals,
nothing left of me, nothing
giving to stamen green-stem pinking tu-lip something stretched open 
something held open, crystalline, green-stem and stamen! 
tu-lip-skin, festered, remote, pinking, abject:TU-LIP is
wilting, thrust, tu-lip is turning-tu-lip-skin and TU-LIP:TU-LIP:TU-LIP
Your being seeps into my TU-LIP - turning me tu-lip-Julu-Nikuko
turning me tu-lip-Azure-Jennifer
