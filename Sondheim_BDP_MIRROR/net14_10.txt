Ethics and Ontology of Cyberspace, Rough Guide







Preface: On Cybermind, Dobie, I believe, initiated a discussion on

"ought" in cyberspace. I was up all night thinking about it, and came

to the conclusion that _any_ analysis is extremely difficult, due, not

only to the problematic of "ought" in relation to juridical issues, but

also to the complexity of the ontology and epistemology of cyberspace 

itself. The following, somewhat formalized, analysis is tentative. It 

does have the merit of recognizing fuzzy boundaries among categories, 

however. There is some reference to my other writings on cyberspace, 

but I find this unavoidable; I can give further bibliographic informa-

tion if necessary.



One other note - the formality (which owes to Wittgenstein) was, for

me, the most reasonable way to proceed without getting lost in the

issues. It was not to create a hardening of analytic discourse.
