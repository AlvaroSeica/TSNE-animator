Read Carefully, Sing


do the mathematical relationships among the various parameters in music
imitate the structure of the real, aligning us with untoward bliss as
raga/rasa theory might portend? is it the aurality of the mathematiza-
tion of the world that takes us over, the Cape Breton fiddler grace notes
indicative of both leeway and recuperation? what if the revolution as note
falls to the ground, God notes in fact, as She is carved away, out of
silence, into the sound of the world. to hear is always to hear rupture,
to dance to it. to dance is to pound the cosmos: Do you know the reason
for the lilt of the waltz, said Jennifer? Because it is an attempt at four
four that gracefully falls to one side or another, that gives itself into
the slide completed only by the denouement after death, thus never wit-
nessed. Music is eternal bifurcation; the binary splits from itself, and
it is the grace notes of God, God noted, that is the _substance_ of life.
Not a secretive force, nor a secretion, she noted. Jennifer said it was
that the universal time is always two two too. And it's the third that
inaugurates the Other.
