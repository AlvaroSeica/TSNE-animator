  too easy and philosophy


  if this were a poem, I would declare my eternal love for you,
  moving on to the next line

  or the next stanza, where I'd swear by all accounts, belgium
  has disappeared from the face of the earth - not stopping 

  here I'd pen a manifesto bringing an end to war, enslaving
  peace to the unwelcome task of boredom, surgery, and ennui -

  hey, but there's more - exclamations! that the body still gets
  a bit excited, almost out of breath - just so

  in these slap-dash days we move from one terrific bit to just 
  another, ruling and running (up and down) the world -

  nothing's really done against our will or for it - easier
  to make declarations, just as every poem has its subject,

  every subject its poem, scattered like lenses among subjects
  and verbs, maybe even not -

  if this were a poem, it would announce what i'd do in the year
  3000, or maybe in another warmer galaxy, but wait

  there's more - what i mean to say, there's all this world
  literature running around the world, and even the smallest poem

  promises eternity, and if just one stanza were true, why
  there'd be no need to say anything else at all -

  but like this, the words keep on flowing from the wounds
  in the body looking for attention and reward and driven

  by really dull dna - there's the really big yay! for example
  when the siloam tunnel was finally dug out near jerusalem -

  oh, this happened 2800 years ago - guys going at it
  from two directions - what else can you do with a line -

  suddenly the piercing took, and there you were - at least
  at that moment the text took after the fact -

  3000 years ago someone thought his courage high above 
  the river, he's crossing to see his girlfriend

  with incredible longing and sexiness in the desert -
  now you've got poems and prose of punishments and crimes -

  whole nations disappearing - there goes vietnam -
  what about a war? well, let's have peace -

  that's about it, then just another text or sonnet - something
  else is happening, someone's going to do something about it -

  i love you all but i love my girlfriend best, good night
