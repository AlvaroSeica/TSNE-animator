Noh


the perfect moments when two scene shifters pass and one of them subtlely
  changes, ontologically moving among realms, o nikuko
there will be water scenes and descriptions of way-stations and there 
  will be a monk who will tell the story, o julu
and the man or the woman will not announce themselves at first and then
  they will announce themselves, o nikuko
and then there will be the propitiation and the world will be properly  
  set and the lovers reunited or forgivenesses all around, o julu
then there will be a dance which will be slow and filled with absence
  carrying humans and spirits along, o nikuko
and then an ending with positions and the stamping of the foot, this will
  be the conclusion resounding beneath the boards, o julu
o nikuko, this is our lives, this is our destiny, these meetings
o julu, there is none beside thee, brought from realm to realm
o nikuko, i await with tears and desperation, the sound of your name
o julu, the water shimmers ever so slightly, fireflies, nets, fireflies
o nikuko, the distant flute
o julu, no one is coming in the dance of spirits, slow dance
and o nikuko, then there will be a world
and o julu, then there will be a world
hush, o nikuko and o julu, hush
hush, o julu, and o nikuko, hush
a thin light, the insect fluttering high above, exhausted, almost falling,
  dim winking of warm and loving light
