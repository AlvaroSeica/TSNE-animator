the sorrow of music

http://www.alansondheim.org/evenings54.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/sorrow.mp3

the sorrow of music or
the sadness of the murmuring of objects or
the memory and living memories among us or

the transitional object of the musical instrument

the instrument is the passing/passage/paysage of notes, 
notations, language; the instrument is a physical object, played 
by others before me, and, through stewardship, played by others 
after me.

thus there are always issues of tending, and issues of 
setting-up, bringing sound out of wood, bone, leather, bamboo, 
to the fullest, to the fullness of the sound, and the slowness 
and urgency of this setup -

thus the transitional object, neither here nor there, neither 
object of or from the body, nor object disparate, separate, 
separated -

what is passed on, after death or through tending towards the 
gift, is organic, is organism, is world, is worlding, both 
through appearance and the caressing of hands, fingers, mouths, 
arms, drawing out the inhabitant, habitus, of the instrument, 
drawing always closer to the breathing of death, to the 
passing-on of instrument and music, to our passing on -

what leaves me, leaves me well, circulation towards a new home, 
inhabitant there, something forever barred from me, the tragedy 
of the gift, of the release, of the relinquishment, of what i 
shall never hear, of what for me shall remain unheard, 
stewardship fading away, tending become a memory, a prayer, 
supplication -

always with an instrument, this phrase: so that others
