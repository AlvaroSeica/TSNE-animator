The Writing


"Writing is a kind of Black Mass he celebrates every evening (before, when
he did nothing else, he preferred writing late at night, between midnight
and three in the morning) when, alone in a room he thinks of as a hole in
the world, a room silhouetted against universal darkness by the single
pool of light from his lamp that reveals a white page, he annihilates the
world and himself merely by the corrosive work of his mind, constructs out
of ink a universe which is drawn from - outlined against - the real and
which, in a bundle of pages greedily accumulated and counted, is the only
one which belongs to him: the Non-Universe, the annihilated universe."

( From The Traitor, Andre Gorz. )
( You will recognize his name, the illuminated screen. You will understand
the mode of reminiscence, the open hole, the corrosion. You will read into
annihilation that violation-fabric which constitutes the building of the
tawdry, sleazy, world, from the remnants of drooled ink, tattered pages,
dim bulbs against a war-time real. )
( You will know that all real is always already war-time. You will think
through this, the mode of reminiscence, into another scene. But there is
no other. )
( And you will call this _the curtailing._)
