Getting it Right

I just got a "student's edition" of Matlab, a matrix/mathematics program,
second-hand, loaded it in DOS, started programming, walking myself through
it. The program below, with only two "real" active lines is typical. Lear-
ning the syntax, getting it right, k, j, as one-place vectors, for examp-
le, was difficult, the format attempting to reach the same odd limits of
analysis as transcendental sine nestings pile error on error, inscribing
the machinic itself in the midst of the plot. The plot is never _right,_
chaos creeping in quickly from the center to the edge. But what if the
semi-colon is omitted? In _this_ language, nothing more than immediate
calculation. Everything has its place. The real difficulty was the shape
of the equations themselves, this being somewhat program-dependent. The
slightest change sends things violently off in the wrong direction: 

such as my attempt to send out a message _exactly_ at the summer solstice
a few minutes ago, at 10:22 PM NY time, only to find out it went, not to
the lists, but to a wrong address I inadvertently entered, the presence of
an "l" instead of "t" alias in the address line... 

% Nested Sin Function
k = [1]; j = [1]; n = 1;
u = 'Nested Sin Function, plot j,k'
z = input('number of operations ');
q = input('constant, p=1 ');
r = input('constant, p-1 ');
s = input('constant for -sin(), 1 ');
t = input('constant for +sin(), 1 ');
while n < z
j(n+1) = sin(k(n))*q - sin(j(n))*s;
k(n+1) = sin(j(n))*r + sin(k(n))*t;
n = n+1;
end
plot(j,k,'+w')
