(the following was sent to a moo email list, on the suggestion that staff
be signifiers, or so i think - anyway, where are signifieds, signifiers,
significance, here, there, everywhere in the top-to-bottom space?)



signified

would rather you be signified
we're all signifiers here, we can't start
or speed the hard-drive, assign sectors, fuck up the mbr
and maybe you can't either, but you can be closer
to the source and the way that the language gets formed
spit out of the mouth of the database, shoved back in
taking its place, well, we're all numbers here
and elsewhere in our dark history, carrying them uselessly,
but you can expand or contract us, maybe
you can issue shutdown as well, checkpoint charlie,
cross the river under the bridge,
MOOs are always honest Berlin
before there was Berlin, and always honest difference
before anyone begged pardon,
said excuse me to anyone else, lowered the eyes, brushed the hair back,
ready to invent the sign


[sector - part of hard-drive disk accessed by an operating system. mbr -
master boot record, a small section of the disk which boots the entire
computer when it's turned on.]
