Sacred koma-inu guard dogs of Shinto, one says A the other says UN,
just the space between them, you see, that's where the cyber is, 
that's maybe where you enter, where you come upon my corpse, it's 
the Buddhists who will bury me, but me, I will see stars and comets,
I will see universe-lives everywhere in the guardian-glittering 
black holed pupils of my eyes opened staring forever at white clouds
against black sky, you see my open heart, don't fuck me when I'm dying
