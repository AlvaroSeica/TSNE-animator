"HOW I JOINED THE UNIX"





With NET stockings, T. VERONICA would LIST to one side. I didn't want 

to FINGER her or SERVER. Her narrow WAIS raised a HOST of questions in 

the WORLD. WIDE WEB or not, you I TEL, NETted were her stockings - as I 

said, sheE MAILed me a pair of them. "What a LYNX you are," she said, "a

regular MOSAIC of TALK N' TALK." I pulled out my JUGHEAD (it's this kind

of POST), and replied, "T. CP? IP!" I could really GOPHER her! I begged,

"Let me watch you!" Silence. "Are you deaF, T.? P!" As if that made me a

man, like ARCHIE! "You're all UNIX," she said in return. "And as for 

stockings, I would USE NET only..." 



"DOS all right," I'd PIPE. "LINE me up." I smiled, bared my teeth. The

next thing I knew, she was yelling "U U BIT NET and tore my new pair up!

F A Q formed, you'd be the first to go!" But I kept begging, "P, G, P!" 

to no avail. I was getting HYPER, TEXan that I am. INTERNIC of time, she

said, "U U C P?" What a SITE! I almost SLIPped on her PP. P, I thought,

I'll COM for you. PING! INTERNET everything is possible! She was getting

angry. She said I was like all the others, MAIL, BOXed my ears! DO MAIN

thing is, I should've used EXPERIMENTAL VERONICA; I was hardly a MAN any

more. What a BAUD! She really took a BYTE out of me... BYE.
