winter logs in hokkaido

honshu incense kamogami smoke calls forth hysterias 
  and the last_time beyond the endless roll of days, 
  answering and calling forth
beyond the shame, honshu incense kamogami smoke, 
  dead words in beauty-smoke kyushu 
last_time is kitakyushu in black earth, the long_lost_time 
  and refugees and dreams and you walked for 261796 hours 
honshu incense kamogami smoke and we are still alive
for 6 days of comas, we have been dissolute and buried,
  and it has taken us 23 minutes to speak our last 
honshu incense kamogami smoke, dead words in beauty-smoke kyushu
winter logs in hokkaido, kitakyushu, moji
your hysterias, fukuoka, are outside my shame
and kitakyushu
our lost_love destroys the smoke of kitakyushu
