Justice


There is no justice in this world! That is, because justice is never _of_
or _in_ the world, nor is it a horizon of the world, nor of community, nor
of the subject. Then one can never be just? One can act accordingly, as if
justice were a past that still encompasses the present. This is the dream,
the opium, the simulacrum, abstraction, but without it, irrigation disap- 
pears and selves dissolve, as if they had once existed.
