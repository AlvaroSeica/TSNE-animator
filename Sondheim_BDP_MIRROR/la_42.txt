  among our legs moon mumbles and opens us ,,
  cells cascade into mouths, we are otherwise ,,
  multitudes, the many, our coverings
    ourselves we do not think to name ,,
  clouds thin and noisy, breathing blood ,
    back into sleepy noisy lungs ,,
  pulling from inside-out, pooling from 
    outside-in ,,
  long and highways coasting ,,,
