Barricade!


Shall we close these lists to children? 
We must protect precious minds, just like we were protected!
This is an _absolute necessity._ 
It's what I call the _instrumental seed._
The seed is the _lever_ which allows us to absolve _ourselves,_ cleanse 
_ourselves,_ as well!
For example: No pornography whatsoever! It's harmful!
Would would ever think that _maturity_ would make such things acceptable?
Thus by the construct of the _instrumental seed_ of the child, the 
purified adult becomes possible.
It's what I call the _heavenly adult,_ one who enters heaven by virtue 
of the _work of God._
It is never too late to cleanse ourselves!
And are we not all children in the eyes of the Lord?
Therefore I propose: That we close these lists to children!
That _first,_ we require proof of age, and _second,_ of sanctity!
We must remember that we have been contaminated, _now,_ at any age!
That we have sinned!
For example: Most of us have spent our lives beneath the corruption
of _abortion!_ 
Thus millions of adults in the womb have been killed every day of our
normal existence!
Now here is the _instrumental seed_: Fight abortion at _any cost._
Others will concern themselves with the millions of children in the world!
Others will house them!
It is _our responsibility_ to take the first step.
It is _our responsibility_ to remember that first steps are always
sufficient!
First steps lead to the heavenly adult! I am sure of this!
Thus, to remain on this list, we require proof of _age and wisdom,_
proof of cleanliness, in fact what we choose to call _beauty proof!_
This will certainly make the Internet less rambunctious!
We will give you thirty-six hours! Don't take our word for it!
Our children depend on you!

(The List-Lord)
