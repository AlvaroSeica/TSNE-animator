Friends, IT IS A TAKE NOT DISSIMILAR TO THIS ONE!

Friends, the OLD FLUORESCENT LIGHTS in the STUDIO OF OUR DREAMS flicker 
on for our ENJOYMENT! Photons cascade in semi-discrete spectra! OUR EYES 
ARE IN OUR EYES!

Friends, When I speak to you today, rest assured, it is with a Hushed 
Voice proclaiming the truth, our bodies in our bodies, but who can tell 
among them? You, who are my friends, who have been with the Vibrant 
Ecstasies of Truth from the very Beginning, know that I speak whereof She 
stands. The Tethering is a Whisper from the Wall. 

FRIENDS, THIS IS A TAKE!
