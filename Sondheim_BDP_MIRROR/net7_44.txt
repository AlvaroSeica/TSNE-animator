Well, what is the nature of pleasure? For one thing, it proceeds through

a sense of smoothness; can one say that pleasure is exhilerating, or does

it in fact embody the maternal, an inhabitation? Or is it simply any 

state of mind that one finds positive? 



It definitely has a relationship to the _swollen;_ it also is used in the

sense of a _gift_ - i.e. what gives me pleasure. Pleasure, like beauty,

has an object and a subject; the subject in the sublime is simultaneously

present and effaced. But in beauty, the pleasure is a projectivity, re-

siding (as-if) _within_ the object; beauty is a communication. Pleasure

suspends the object; beauty embraces it.



The smoothness of pleasure is connected to the _voluptuous_, a linkage or 

conglomeration of objects. This conglomeration is _tumescent,_ iridescent,

a sheen or fetish - but pleasure taken _in_ an object is the surround of

the object as well - so that we're speaking here of a spherical projec-

tion that returns the dream as well - "he's so dreamy!" - I also sense, in

pleasure, a _swallowing_ effect.



All of these attributives fall under the aegis of the body, or within/     

without the body, the blurring of pearlescent skin, a softness absorbing

the granularity of the real. This is also the pleasure of masochistic 

pain (vis-a-vis Studlar or Deleuze), the dulled wave/emissions spreading

throughout the body, healed by the final contract of the sublime (you are

sublime, are you not, mistress)...



Is there pleasure in the beauty of stuttered cybermind/cyberspace?
