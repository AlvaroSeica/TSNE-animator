TERROR





If cyberspace is a construct of labor, of fragmentation, of perturbed

ontologies, it is also a construct of terror:



I will tell you a little secret, that I have never again been able to

believe in One, anywhere, anymore, except the One of the remorseless

state, bloated with power - ever since I found out, about taking Jews

into cyberspace, melting into the ether - ever since I read the Medi-

cal Cases testimony of the Nurenberg War Trials:



The surgical and anatomical examination of Jews subjected to a chamber

from which the air was slowly and systematically withdrawn (and I will

not go into the details here), reproducing the pure and full vacuum of

space to the best of 1940s technological ability:



The bodies taken out from under them, the bodies transformed into pure

information, the silencing of the bodies (screams carrying poorly in

the rarified air, at first, then no screaming whatsoever), ruptured,

exploded into the ether (did they know there wasn't an ether, wasn't a

God, not even consciousness):



Organism can't live in the terror of cyberspace, the wind howls in their

ears, then there isn't any wind, the wind stops because there isn't any

air (and what is the ontology of the wind, you may ask as long as you 

have the breath and health to ask it):



What I want to know, who built these ships that carried them into those

uncharted seas, those routers - those premonitions of cyberspace, which

is now, I do believe, harmless much in the degree of it:



So that - my little secret, since that endurance, ending with the annih-

ilation of finality itself - I have lost faith (in One or the Other, in 

healing and all prayerfulness and supplication, even now nightmares

return with beatings and punishments of all sorts) - in anything but 

those men and women blasted into cyberspace and Godhead, dead, gone, and 

one with everything in the World:



Which is not to say that cyberspace _is_ or _is not_ this or that, but

that the episteme and ontology have yet to be described, remaining, in

their own write, obdurate and irreducible.
