in Transport dost Thou send me,
to and from Wastelands and Pales,
into Plains of Jewels and Perfection,
into great Halls of Tourmalines and Amber,
yes, of Tourmalines and Amber,

my name lalulu

i'm writing this heading towards amnesia. my name is alan, my name is 
azure, my name is nikuko, my name is jennifer, my name is julu, my name... 
my name... what would you call me, were you to call me, call me forth, 
what is the employ, what chorus evolutes, meanders among them, waking me 
from my vast sleep, wolverine and granite, tourmaline and grey amphibole?

well, i'm writing this heading towards amnesia. my name is alan, my name 
is azure, my name is nikuko, my name is jennifer, my name is julu, my 
name... my name... what would you call me, were you to call me, call me 
forth, what is the employ, what chorus evolutes, meanders among them, 
waking me from my vast sleep, wolverine and granite, tourmaline and grey 
amphibole, among one and among others, we murmur assent, communal

i produce nothing, i wait, i await, among horizons and auroras i await, 
among the deaths and births of stars, i await, this is the doings of mind, 
this is among neutrinos and muons, this shatters, is shattering, mica and 
schist, is shattering, is turning towards beginnings, i am yet among you, 
i am yet present, i am yet awaiting, a calling, a going forth, a murmuring

ululal demos thrope, thorn and thrown, borne among and bred among them, 
shorn ululal among them, smote and smoke, beryl and azurite, dig dig! 
among them,

a murmuring already constructs wayward trouble for us, subverting the

13636, womanly, among one and among others, we murmur assent, communal? 
but what is ululal demos thrope, thorn and thrown, borne among and bred 
among them, here, its thing?

PCMs


Years ago I designed a PCM, this was around 1970 maybe. PCM stands for 
Parameter Control Module; the idea was to create a unit which could 
connect and control other similar units. PCMs were digital but they didn't 
need to be. There were any number of inputs and outputs. The idea was that 
anything could be connected to anything else. In other words, there were 
standardized simple protocols in terms of voltage and bandwidth; every- 
thing functioned like blood in the veins of some untoward ganglion. In 
order to enter the PCM array, translation was necessary from an outside 
world into the protocols; this was the job of an input interface which 
could be tailored for particular situations. The interface was divided 
into two sections: the outer section was tailored to the world, and the 
inner, to the emission of protocols. So the input interface was generous 
in its acceptance. At the other end of the array, there was a similar 
output interface, divided into two sections; the inner section was 
tailored to the protocols, sending the signal current to the outer 
section, which was tailored to the world, and generous. For example, an 
audio input interface might take microphone signals and standardize them, 
sending them to the array; an audio output interface might take the array 
protocols and send them simultaneously to audio amplifiers and a lighting 
board. What made the array of greater interest, of course, is that input 
and output signals could also be applied directly to any particular PCM, 
bypassing the standard interfaces. The array as a whole, as a ganglion, 
would be in effect a ganglion open to the world at any place or space, 
both for input and output. One might think of the PCMs as formal neurons. 
Internally, the components of the PCMs might be smoothly voltage-control- 
led, with the possibility of directly inputting different equations; one 
might begin with standard smooth trigonometric functions and replace them 
with discontinuities of all sorts, including chaotic behavior. I believe 
to this day that designing the PCMs would have been a relatively trivial 
matter. Although the project remained stillborn, the concept behind it 
remains of interest to me. I've begun to think of the arrays, inputs and 
outputs, as an affair in which anything might modify or influence any- 
thing, including, reflexively, itself. The arrays in fact might be virtual 
and one thinks only of empty, undefined, space or air, a distant model of 
the real and external world, where such things happen. Thus anything here 
and now has the potential for affecting anything else, and anything might 
seem to turn around and talk directly with you, listening, at the same 
time, to your innermost thoughts, whatever you choose to reveal: here are 
the input and output interfaces. What goes on in such virtual arrays is 
only the ideality of the world itself, the ability to take-for-granted 
that there are always relatively stable domains for communication or 
dwelling, for work or discourse, and so forth. Any dynamic action, any 
action which changes in time, might be considered to be modeled thus; any 
static action might be one which leaves the virtual array quiescent. The 
size and power of the virtual PCMs are also of interest; as they decrease, 
one might argue that the granularity of the world is increasingly differ- 
entiated, just as their increase transforms the granularity into rougher 
constructs handled by integration. In the middle lies everyday life, where 
processing of this sort is kept to a minimum. I can imagine in this 
fashion thinking of the world as a vast complex of fundamental operations 
on the ordering of everyday life, just as Aristotelian logic and its laws 
of distribution appear to deal well with the uncanny lack of transience of 
everyday objects. The edges of such modeling, however, are always limit- 
points which a different kind of roughness appears, for example quantum 
phenomena or color vision or even corrosion. To some extent, these rough 
processes, including unknown one, can be imagined within the virtual array 
which would have additional signals, alarm signals, that anomalies were 
working their way into or out of the array; there could be, in fact, 
virtual interfaces utterly open to the real, whose sole purpose would be 
the conversion of such anomalies. One process would be that of the name, 
beginning with the proper name, and working towards untoward generaliza- 
tions; another would be that of radical smoothing, and a third might be 
the cessation of array activity altogether. I think of this as burrowing 
or death, depending on the degree of destruction or rearrangement 
encountered. Likewise, there would be inverse processes, those of birth or 
emerging, in which partial identity transformations would remain and 
perhaps even be backwards-traceable, backwards-compatible in terms of the 
protocols. The whole, virtual and real, is a form of metaphor ready to be 
implemented. I can only conclude that the same is already in the world, 
and perhaps always already in the world, it is there and here, it is 
operational or quiescent as you like. And such would be the world and its 
dynamics; it is only a question of looking over your shoulder, back into 
the space you have just left behind, forward into the space your are about 
to enter. If you have the time, of course, without catastrophe or 
disruption.
