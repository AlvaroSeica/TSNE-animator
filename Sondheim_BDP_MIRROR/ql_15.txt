3. recoil of the body. The body recoils from forgetting, stating its 
limits which are the limits of production in the world. The recoil is 
that of death: beyond this speed or stretch, for example, one cannot go. 
This is usually taken for granted, set-aside, just as the sounds of flute 
or saxophone keys, or cello bow reversal, are set aside, but it - this 
barrier - is integral to musical production. Let me also place, then, 
under the aegis of recoil, all those sounds, necessary and often consid- 
ered parasitic, accompanying what one is intending; I also assert that it 
is these sounds, subtextual, almost subterranean, that constitute the 
true-real of music, that assert world and worlding among a displaced 
purity - which, however, already harbors the digital at its core. (I 
assert? one asserts... is asserted...)
