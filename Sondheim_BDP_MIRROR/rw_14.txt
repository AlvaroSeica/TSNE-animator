1 ar is localized 
 ar -> {x sub y}

2 ar is interference (googleglass)
 entanglement

3 ar is distancing (lorenz, ethology, avoidive behavior)
in terms of active engagement
 drawing distinction, 'defoliation'

4 ar is technology- and corporate- dependent
 capital multiflux jitters, hyper-hyperbole

5 ar is protocol- and codec- dependent
 codework internalized

6.ar is clever
 ar is w(W)ired

7 ar has the potential for deep history and deep ecology
 historiographies

8 ar like tablets creates class distinctions in the school
system
 capital / Kapital

9 ar needs to get rid of external in favor of embedded
technologies
 on the level of the sensory aegis

10 ar is coming whatever one thinks of it: ar is here
 corporate, ar -> {W}

11 ar may be distancing in terms of passive engagement -
think of issues of slaughter, pain, resource consumption,
etc.
 image epistemology, bypass surgery, suture 

12 ar will increasingly be independent of technological
sophistication on the part of the user
 autonomic somaticism

13 military drones are the most sophisticated application
of ar: why are we not making the connection?
 tunneling effects, embedded theory

14 w/ googleglass privacy is destroyed: the third person
devours the first person transformed into the second 
person
 ar will talk not to you but among you

15 does augmentation always improve the quality of our
lives?
 lifeworlds and does it matter?

16 ar is useful in specific situations - say, the 
location of mines in mine-fields, in surgeries, in
situations that involve specificity and deep knowledge
 deep geographies, geopolitics

17 ar is useful as a demonstration of ar, of what lies
behind the ordinary - mark skwarek's erasure of the dmz
 but what lies behind is digital, truth is problematic,
 anything may be inserted

18 in this sense ar is highly useful as a symbolic
construct
 or the symbolic

19 and in this sense the recording of ar for others is 
equally useful as a symbolic construct - it presents 
the subjunctive
 potential individual communality beneath the sign of
 capital

20 ar -> digital over or among analog - what are the
phenomenologies here? what are the potentials or
dangers, what entanglements, what flows of capital?
