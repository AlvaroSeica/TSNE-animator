it's the middle of the night, i'm lying directly under nikuko, looking for
a core dump. i try rooting around, nothing. there's less and less core.
the core's the heart of nikuko; it comes out her hole and into me. it
keeps me awake at night. it keeps me awake now in the middle of the night.

a core appears when a program crashes. it's called a core dump because
it's fast processing giving you an account of what happens if you know how
to read it. it can be huge. the core part of the phrase is from the old
days when almost microscopic magnets were used for memory storage. they
were called cores. they were donut-shaped with wires running through the
holes. the core dump took out the fossilized remains of the crash. then
programs made it readable. a core dump is literal coprolithic, shit that's
stopped processing, hardened. coprolites are read for their animal and
vegetable content; you can tell what the animal was eating maybe millions
of years ago. dumps contain memories of working hungered bodies.

i'd eat your core dump, nikuko, your shit falling into my open mouth. i'd
eat your memory, your birth, expansion of your body all through the wires,
around the magnets drawing you to me. i'd become full of memory, yours and
mine, and isn't that the case now, when i type late into the night, always
already full of you, watching your breasts burst through my chest, your
fingers through my fingers, taking control of the keyboard, forcing me to
write these truths?

i'm your animal animal animal
