Internet Text Index


The following is the index for my Internet Text, found at
http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/~spoons/internet_txt.html The file
names are on the right-hand side. Please note that the files contain much
more than these subjects; index refers to larger individual texts or ser-
ies of texts interwoven through one or more files. You may want to "read
around" a particular text for further material.

The Index


The Index I posted yesterday is a guide to the long-waveforms that inhabit
the 1200 or so sections that constitute the Internet Text as a whole. Wri-
ting it gave me the opportunity to see what was manifest in the work over
the past two years, and what was hidden, articulated beneath the surface,
submerged. Gender, for example, appears as a concern everywhere, yet it is
not the focus of a particular group of texts; likewise, software and the
Web are discussed throughout, but not as titled subject-matter. Software
and gender form lamina or strata weaving across domains, the former an in-
dex of totality producing differentiation within the machinic, and the la-
tter, an index of differentiation producing totality within the organic.
Interwoven, the Internet Text extrudes from the Cyborg realm, the produc-
tion of continuous investment, interweaving, neurosis. There are numerous
references to writers such as Kristeva, Derrida, Irigaray, etc., yet none
of these have their own listings in the Index; again, they're interwoven
presences. 

The _thickness_ of the text is exhausting; even with the index, the forty-
some files must be searched for interior references. No one will ever read
this mass; it's clotted, puerile-puellile, monstrous. At night, words spew
against violated-fabric flesh, organ-receptors flooded by leaked vowels,
torn open by consonants, dammed by punctuation. There is no end to it; the
hole remains a mobius strip sutured and stripped at every grapheme, demar-
cation, inscription. It is a gone world of perversion, inverted, sensing
itself senseless. It rides me. It continues.
