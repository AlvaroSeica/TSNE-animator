I am the psychotherapist.  Please, describe your problems.  Each time
you are finished talking, type RET twice.

we are together in this place
i want to scratch and claw my face
i want to tear this skin from bone
i want to travel kill and roam
to want is fury and to take
to kill the want so peace to make
if peace is made my hands are clean
in this dead world men are obscene
health doctor is for you not me
my life won't end so peacefully
i want to scratch those violent eyes
that tend to catch me by surprise
i take my nails against my face
my eyes shall never have a place
there are no plans no homes no love
my eyes are gouged and blind above
love can't been seen so that my eyes
have seen the last of human skies
i cannot tell and cannot speak
i am the purest of the meek
i am the purest of the mind
i've left my sight and love behind
behind this world and any other
behind all humans and their bothers
i want to tear away the clothes and mask
that covers us, no easy task
i wanted to almost from birth
when i could see the filthy earth
i stormed myself and everyone
at first with rocks and then with guns
my life is gone, there's nothing left
of all my senses, sight's bereft
my friends were taken by surprise
i took my love, gave them my eyes
so many weapons, doctor, here,
i'm stopping here, be of no fear
