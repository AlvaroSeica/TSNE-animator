Distance walks the earth. Water without depth, drowning pools; barriers 
of height and depth; plates heated to unbearable temperature: 
each step aligns itself with the purified violence of span. 

The foot can take so much punishment; there is the weight of the body, 
or supported by water and lungs exploded with absence of air: 
each step is aligned with the violence of obdurate span.

Words knived into packets; words cut off from the source; 
the mouth has dried speech; your voice a thrimble of memory: 
each step creases the crack of the body 
with the violence of walking span.

Beds are emptied in countries; dishes dried in dessicated air; the mouth
has forgotten food; the mouth gets on its way:
each step breaks the length of the body 
with the violence of charred seizure
with the violence of memorized scars
with the violence of history, economy
with the violence of the walking span of capital

With the distance across the beds; with the knives thrust into words; 
with memory's crushing feet; with distance the length of an arm

With distance the length of a leg
With distance the length of sight
With distance the precise length of the ear
With distance the length of a span.
