the desert, the stream in the desert
the framing and construction of death
the processing of death
the violation of identity and descendents

occasion of death is no occasion
violation of mourning constriction of mourning
the building of the mark of decapitation
the race and religion of death's framing
the bodies of death's framing the gender
the fury and condemnation of bodies 
the annihilation of infinitesimals
scrabbling of infinitesimals annihilation of limits
the burnings, everywhere the burnings

the images sicken me, less and less cartoons, 
more and more the transgression of eidetic imagery
now i am tired, now i must rest






467. I am sitting with a philosopher in the garden; he says 
again and again "I know that that's a tree", pointing to a tree 
that is near us. Someone else arrives and hears this, and I tell 
him: "This fellow isn't insane. We are only doing philosophy."

Great Review of our new cd Threnody!

Check it out -

http://disasteramnesiac.blogspot.com/2015/08/disaster-amnesiac-mixed-bag-of.html


Alan Sondheim/Azure Carter/Luke Damrosch-Threnody: Shorter Discourses of 
the Buddha-Public Eyesore Records #133, 2015
If you've read this blog at all within the last year or so, you'll be 
well-appraised at how generous Public Eyesore/eh? Records have been to me 
(thanks, Bryan!) They sent over the newest offering from Alan Sondheim and 
Azure Carter a few weeks back, and Disaster Amnesiac has been digging this 
one greatly. Threnody features the extensive talents of Sondheim on 19 
instruments, and he shows tremendous skills on all of them. His 
skittering, fast string playing throws out all manner of micro-tonal 
delights within its speedy delivery, and his playing on wind instruments 
has emotional depth, warmth, and balance. Sondheim's aesthetic evinces the 
awesome power of Folk-based sounds within the greater musical spectrum. 
Dear America: please pay attention to this homegrown talent! It's a shame 
that Sondheim's six decades of singular musical development are not as 
widely acknowledged. He's a Master. Also quite enjoyable are the 
understated vocals from Carter. Listening to Azure sing evokes the same 
kind of pleasure for me that comes from reading well written Minimalism. 
Great clarity and enjoyment comes from the apparent simplicity of her 
delivery, which is completely free of extraneous embellishment. Would that 
so many other current singers learn from her! The addition of Luke 
Damrosch on guzheng and madal adds percussive string and drum depth, 
respectively, and his layered summation of Threnody's totality of songs on 
Alltracks achieved by use of Supercollider software, is deliciously 
bizarre and thick!

Sterling 19th-century banjo in a myna mynor key

http://www.alansondheim.org/radio093.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/mynorbanjo.mp3

when I play I'm always trying to extend my abilities, try 
something new until I've exhausted it. here, the banjo is tuned 
to a minor key, and because of the instability of the minor 
(hence myna bird, mimic, new languages), especially around the 
third, I can move freely and quickly through different episodes, 
structures that come and go; towards the end of the pieces, 
tunes appear and disappear, almost but not quite dance music. 
it's hard to keep track of the structures, especially since the 
way I play involves fast runs up and down the neck, which brings 
muscle memory constantly into play - where have I been, where am 
I going? and these are general questions of course, for which 
the instrument becomes a chora or microcosm of potential and 
ultimate stasis, only here, within the playing, there's still 
quick thinking and a bit of time on the planet.
