http://www.alansondheim.org/AnitaDroste.mp4 thinking 
through the empyre list among other things, silence
and mourning, butoh, sexuality, the slightest gesture,
those which cannot be named, suffering and repetition

thing I can about Anita Berber. I identify with the _lunge._ 

Nightmares 
throat

throat Anita Berber
skeleton Anita Berber

Droste and Berber in rehearsal
by the hairs of Droste and Berber
cut off from the bodies of Droste and Berber
a framework where Berber first sadly languished
the hairs of Droste and Berber were tangled sadly
among them the  memories of Droste and Berber
performance-fix, cure and cognac, despair,
Anita Berber nightrance nakedance in 
dawndusk morning, mourning, 'I am as pale as moonsilver.' 
dawndusk morning, mourning, 'I am as pale as moonsilver.' 
by the hairs of Droste and Berber
cut off from the bodies of Droste and Berber
a framework where Berber first sadly languished
the hairs of Droste and Berber were tangled sadly
among the reels where memories of Droste and Berber
and nothing remains but fear, and the slightest scent

every time i work i think, these are my last moments alive,
and these are the last things i will see, and these are the
last things i will have sown, alone, or among others, all
the world is so precious, everything so fragile, everything
on the edge of abyss
