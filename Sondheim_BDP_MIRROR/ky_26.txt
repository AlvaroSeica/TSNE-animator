large and luminous questionable


i tried again to sleep last night ka? you know ka? i didn't take the mela-
tonin, just held on/in there ka? dreams of abandonment but also fulfill-
ment ka? you don't say ka? the welling of the interrogative ka? i'm not
thinking literature but of you before me, posing the question ka? i wonder
about you, nikuko ka? you always seem to be the harbinger of problematics
ka? you know ka? it's nothing in particular ka? my voice doesn't carry
well over the net ka? there's nothing that can be done about it ka? you've
got to extrapolate, julu ka? what's a question but a search for suture,
completion ka? make it whole again, fill the hole ka? i'm not implying
gender ka? you know ka? it has - the interrogative that is - its own agen-
da ka? what one might call a life of its own ka? you know ka? there are
only the three of us and i'm always already on the line ka? the interrog-
ative as if there were a large and luminous face behind the world - to ask
a question presupposes realms of meaning ka? as if meaning were there, not
ours ka? beautiful moon-face buddha-face behind the question ka? you know
ka? the big questions, the one that presuppose answers ka? all i'm trying
to say, you know ka? it might not be the philosophies ka? it's the inter-
rogative itself that needs querying ka?
