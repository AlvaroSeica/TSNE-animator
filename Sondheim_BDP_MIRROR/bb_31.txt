Badly Written Post but An Interesting Quote


Herbert Schiller, in Information Inequality:

One more time in American history, a new communications technology is
being promoted with uncritical acclaim, while it is being turned over to
corporate management. Cautionary voices, and there are a few, point out
the folly of the current policy. George Brown, for example, the former
chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, insists
that "Our most serious problems are social problems for which are there no
technical solutions, only human solutions." So, too, Les Brown, veteran TV
critic and observer, playfully notes "The Seven Deadly Sins of the Digital
Age," which he sees as: "1. Inequality; 2. Commercial exploitation and in-
formation abuse; 3. Threats to personal privacy; 4. The disintegration of
community; 5. Instant plebiscites and the distortion of democracy; 6. The
tyranny of gatekeepers, and 7. The loss of public service values and soc-
ial responsibility." These warnings remain unacceptable to dominant think-
ing and there is no reason, therefore, to believe that the information
highway outcome will be more satisfactory than media technology uses have
been throughout the twentieth century.
