Neither here nor there,
Not both here and there
I am constructed out of spacetime
So that I extrude, delirious I excrete,
Leave grounds for finding myself;
Histories run like boxed rivers in my vicinity
Look who's there in the corner of the room
His head up against the wall dissolving
Into his head up against the wall

Don't be discrete
