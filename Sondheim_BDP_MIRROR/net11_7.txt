Sit This Set Out.





somewhere want to say brittle beauty



the one time I sat in on a session in Paris I was drunk at le Chat

qui Peche on the left bank and had borrowed I think it was an alto

but it might have been a tenor there were these guys from Morocco

one named Alain who later died on a trainwreck France's leading

alto I think again in the style of Ayler (Albert not Don) and I was

onstage and birds bright and yellow flew out of the horn



but I didn't know what I was doing nor at that point how to listen

so I heard myself and the abyss opened up in every direction those

birds flew in darkness but that's not the end of the moral nor my

fear american whiteboy jewboy in the midst of Vietnam and I couldn't

go wouldn't go anywhere



because I took that stuff with me to Copenhagen where I heard Dexter

Gordon and burning with a fierce desire now I had a drummer turned me

on to Art Blakey I him to Guiseppe Logan so we played there at a 

student center got picked by reggae rock and roll Jamaicans holding 

back on the fours and I went to Indian flute which I carried listened 

hard to the drumming watching the audience for thr highnote release 

and it worked each and every time the last we had three-hundred odd

attending attending and screaming pleasure screaming pleasure



before is our first disaster concert come late in the telling with

an obdurate Dane misinterpreting Cecil Taylor /who I just now heard on

on Mercer? Street side-walk caving in/ and then along comes Ted Joans 

who turned me onto something from Mali and played a lick or two, that's 

trumpet, and I heard him, that's Mali



later I recorded with the drummer and some others but thinking now and

after hearing Taylor once again



this enormous onslaught on Black Music, New Thing Music, Leroi Jones'

applecore articles for the old Down Beat lost lost forever, and all 

those, all those notes gone and gone and gone, real birds like the Bird 

Lives tacked all over Copenhagan near the Dew Drop Inn with the junkie

needles etched in the thick glass door - gone annihilation alley death

as if they never were, and all that writing and latenight and now Ayler 

dead years ago and any fucking kid can get a squeal out of the horn 



and I keep think, that space, that space, literal as in: across the

Seine, more altosound down beneath Notre Dame by the concrete banks mid-

night war-night screams, or figural as in: this abyss now, here, finding

ourselves, these notes now lost, or as in death or a future double-

decade, who's playing what, who's listening, what dark new music fatal

to emerge



the last night met a woman Maya who told me her name meant illusion 

nothing could hold back time all the gone new music all the gone



this was culture-murder now what's going to be
