  What happens here? This list was assembled last December 18, 1997; it
  is the user lexicon for an editor I was using at the time, and indi-
  cates the state of unaccepted terms. In other words: To write myself
  into existence, the following were repeatedly employed; these did not
  exist in the conventional dictionary but had to be added by hand. In
  other words: These represent those extensions I defined _against_ the
  standard dictionary - extensions I thought sufficiently important to
  be warranted entries of their own. In other words: These are the terms
  of the language that became the defining language of Alan, Nikuko, Ju-
  lu, and Jennifer. In other words: These are the armatures of an envel-
  ope of emanants.
  
  How I kidded myself in those days, thinking the thoughts that would
  later entail the fullness of a real which was only, after all, ins-
  cribed! "Wryting" for example appeared as the entailment of a trans-
  gressive ontology; "deleuze" and "guattari" applied the phallus to its
  inscribed absence by a foreclosed rhizome; and "ikonic" as well as
  "Ikon" seemed - by virtue of the "k-replacing-c" - to gather a hard-
  ness round about, stopping and cathecting the icon itself. Whatever
  appeared to be the case, never was; all I have been able to reiterate
  is "nothing, nothing, nothing" and the fullness thereof.
