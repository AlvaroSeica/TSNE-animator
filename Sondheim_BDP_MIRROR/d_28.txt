What Time is It?





So he writes to Lili, he writes he's tired of Alan using his name, 

	he writes what if it is the same, we gotta do what we gotta do

		and hey do you know what time it is -

This time there's no silence, this time Lili

	looks up and says he's in love his posts are a mess

		he's in love and whatever he's said

			there's no stopping it, 

				it's the same old story !

So he writes back and says what's this got to do with Cybermind, cause

	we need a bit of the anguish, the guns gunning, flags waving !

		Aw Lili looks up and says

Stop this silly writing, will you? 

	We're lying in bed together just like we always wanted !

		Can't you ever say anything?

			Just like that ! Face to face !

				Can't you ever say anything at all? !
