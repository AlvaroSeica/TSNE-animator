[commentary: an absurdity. there is no way out. of a springtime evening. 
the pun provides the content. i tried repeatedly to salvage. the 'jot' 
command was extremely useful. it attached itself to various programs. i 
don't think that was good enough. i was close to stopping. i continued 
with process after process. it was never good enough; this commentary 
doesn't help.]

Amerika for Theorists


Understand we are a mean country first of all; social Darwinism on the
most brutal and vulgar scale dominates our thinking. Never mind we are
down on the quality of life indices; we demand to be counted the greatest
country on earth, one which is god-given. Understand our compassion comes
at a price; if you do not place us on human rights commissions, we will
bomb you, withhold funds, throw more of our own in jail.

Understand we are not a democracy; our "president" was not elected by a
majority; our gunlaws go wildly against the demographic grain; our health-
care is dominated by drug companies and professionals who wreak havoc
among the poor and elderly.

Understand we are guilty of the worst racisms, the largest jail popula-
tions, and one of the most violent societies on the planet. Understand we
believe in white male superiority, the punishment of the poor, and the
exaltation of violence which makes a man, a man.

Understand our ignorance; we do not know the capitals and heads of states
of our neighboring countries, much less their policies. They are our bor-
ders and our dominions; they are independent by virtue of our kindness.
Understand free trade is free profiteering without regard to environmental
regulation and protection. Understand Amerika comes first and we do not
care about global warming or pollution unless these are cost-free and
immediately economically beneficial to our upper classes.

Understand our poor are already our walking dead; that our poor come in
all colors; that they are irrelevant; that we believe their votes can be
bought, sold, and ignored; that we believe they are diseased and obstacles
to greater and greater wealth.

Understand our meanness is tied to our greed; that our rapaciousness knows
no bounds; that ignorance can be fought by the blunt edge of the sword;
that we do not care if we make enemies and more enemies. Understand our
word "freedom" is our word, not yours, and all of us are perfectly free in
this great land of ours.

But above all, understand our meanness: to those of us whose voice is
irrelevant, to those of us who oppose us, to any country or demographics
that crosses our beliefs, to our own creative artists. Understand we
possess the violence of the Taliban, ready to unleash it; that our jails
are overpopulated by victims of our Apartheid; that we possess, at a
moments notice, the bludgeon of Nazism. And understand that we are the
Panopticon; we have the god-given right to spy on each and every human on
the planet, and to destroy him or her at will.

You must understand this if you are to extract the marrow from the bone,
the muscle from the brain; you must understand this if you are to defeat
us, reduce us to ash and fragments of contaminated flesh, in our god-given
country, the greatest of them all.

but my toes in my hands and my elbows in my knees
and my feets in my arms and my necks in my necks
with my nipples in my belly and my belly in my nips
and my hair in my soles and my soles in my hair
standing upside-down with my ankles in my nose
and my nose in my ankles and my waist just the same
i'm standing upside-down and looking right-side up
looking just like you and looking just like me
but i'm standing upside-down with my eyes in my toes

Item from: KYUSHU HEADLINE NEWS, Fukuoka Now, 5/16/01

 * Teenagers from Fukuoka Die in Tokyo
Two high school girls from Kasuya, Fukuoka committed suicide yesterday
when they jumped from the top of a multi-storey building in Tokyo. The
girls left a message " We have no special reason to die, but then again we
have no reason to live either".

Poem: "Our memories"

Our memories are our computers; both constitute the world unbidden,
assemble according to implicit instructions beneath the surface output,
present results as if they were part of the natural order of things;
produce results inscribed upon the screen of dreams and the dream-screen,
give semblance to the small, allow the possibility of scaling through
further processing, create and utilize modules and subroutines, are
capable of harboring the very feel of a 1940s early winter road in evening
mining-town Pennsylvania, intersect with the very phenomenology of
subjective being according to protocols and object-oriented modeling, tend
towards the unraveling of the external world as likewise fabricated or
constituted, require input and maintenance, need to operate in safe spaces
with environmental controls, generate meaning according to attributes and
interpretations weighted with the history of the organism itself, have 
deletion mechanisms which are less than perfect, reside between hardware 
or wetware and communication strategies and protocols, rely on community 
and communality for their construction, are at least in part reflexive 
although not self-reflexive, are simultaneously neural and non-neural, 
exist between or among networks and resonances and require compilers and 
interpreters for the most part, always have incomplete access based on the 
superstructural appearance of autonomy in emergent semantic holarchies, 
are accumulative, have both short-term and long-term functions which may 
involve different circuitries and storage mechanisms, are increasingly 
interpenetrated and epistemologically diffuse, increasingly share fuzzy 
ontological domains which are problematized in relation to fragmentary 
knowledge and knowledge flows, are fragile in relation to the catastrophic 
pathways of the real world, are redundant to a certain degree particularly 
in relation to other memories and machines which may not be networked into 
or across the subject, are in a chiasmic relation to the extent that 
computers have memories and memories compute, are split in relation to 
carbon-based and/or silicon construction, involve parallel and/or columnar 
processing, may die with the death of the organism or destruction of the 
hard-drive matrix or power-withdrawal, may be passed on elsewhere through 
networking and external inscriptive technologies, are inscriptive flows 
and forms themselves, exist within potential wells, present epistemic 
structures apparently broken from the formal means and organization of 
storage, problematize and are problematized by any theorization, query 
meaning through the frisson or jouissance of meaning generated by reading 
strategies across and through inscriptions, are never fully recuperated in 
relation to the referent, and are distinguished from each other by a 
primary division between digital and analog in which the former is 
characterized by potential eternal repetition while the latter is only 
reproduced through an exponential increase in noise including the death of 
memory and its spattering into quantum irretrievability.

wanting my due in the waning moon

Thu May 17 14:52:39 EDT 2001
The Moon is Waning Crescent (29% of Full)

ghosts haunt me, you haunt me with your power, you could take me, end my
resentment and neuroses just like that, i'll be happier than you can ever
imagine, think how you'll save a human being, just put me in that series
of solo exhibitions coming up, that big group show of the chosen, just
include me in your anthology with the color cover, you can color my texts,
it would be an honor, i want to be multi-media of multi-media, i want to
influence the world, i want my name spoken on unknown lips with great
smiles and understandings, yes, juries too, i want to be awarded the big
grants, the important ones, the ones that keep me alive, let me work
towards greater and greater goals, i want the genius grants, the lifetime
achievement awards :wipe me into existence with the cloth of creativity!
bring me forward among the legions of new media personnel, so what if my
code's code povera, if my work's on email lists in your back yard, in your
email in my backyard, don't ever forget my name when the next big show
comes along, i want projection, i want the wall full of my dna :i wait and
wait and wait for my work to be lovingly accepted as new media, all right
you can't click on it, it's got wonderful audio and video, it moves on the
screen or the words like these dance all out of order, wayward and
contrary, real and true eruptions of language, please help me in this
endeavor, i want to win big prizes and get in the big shows i need your
help, this is a cheap ploy, pass this on to all judges and juries, forget
i said that, but do, really pass this on, you can find my work almost
anywhere :terrific multi-media inclusions of everything i do in new media
:all new media and me 

:terrific multi-media inclusions of everything i do in new media

when i begin to think in the depths of darkness and despair
that my spirits have started already to sink, accustomed as they are
 to that bleak lair
where they have remained, sullen, sodden, unblinked, in the dank air
then already i am moved to the hulled brink of the ship already there
and waiting while i turn from heavy food and drink to a more ferocious 
 pair
of arms and murdered thighs that link drugged venom to sickened skin,
 so perfect and so bare
redolent with thick chains that clink as if the body coupled to them
 were without a care
as words spill, totter, and drowning, sink in the wombs of her marine 
 lover, her nightmare
coursing through the chink remaining after day has gone, her arms
 weaving, churning, as if to tear
the dull atmosphere, thrust and knotted, kink and close to broken,
 her disheveled hair
wild and wayward, contrary, a potential well or sink or source of her
 eyes' moans and stare
bleak across the flesh, pink, ripened, split open, already hard to bear
thought of any sort, nothing of those eyes, a wink, nothing harsh
 to wear
beyond the rotted stink, beyond the broken chair, beyond her one last
 dare, beyond the sward, the mink fink, beyond the rare, the fair,
then does that bleak lair rise from what were the harsh sink
in still harsher air, eyes tied open, unblinked
there, near ships hull hovering on the brink
while i double, split, an ugly pair engorged on gorge's drink
and half of me bare and half all ready now to link
with the utmost care, my chains are broken, clink
down from this nightmare, and once again they sink
and wither from my flesh and tear through my last remaining chink
i'm bound with her thick hair, a form of sputtered kink
my eyes are open, stare, this naked body yet another sink
of holes spread and bare, the wanton image darkened brown and pink
and naked, not a thing to wear, as if a joke or wink
or dare in the right place, or chair or drink, her fair pink
self against my stink, bound in that bleak lair, the mink 
tied hard, i doubled, harsh sink and bleak lair fair and sink.

Final Pornography: The Body of Jennifer-Alan


But I've never done a pornographic film, sex show, public display. And the
decathecting of the (pornographic?) image, perhaps, through the dark sha-
dow, the premonition of uneasy sexuality, pornography, is nearly as radic-
alized. It might be the difference between pornography, which partakes of
the exhaustion of pornography, turning-away from the image effluvia and
the substance in pornography that defuges; there is a constellation - por-
nography / fetishization / rhyme - rhythm a stride or unconscious.
 *  nikuko-america wants to watch your cock
In pornography, it is the image on the level of the symbolic which uncon-
sciously appertains to the unconscious. In the pornographic image, the man
or woman are inchoate accusations of the other; the trashed pornographic
image is used up. In this sense, in rhyme and the pornographic image, life
itself is a form of pornographic exhaustion. I think the secrecy is criti-
cal; again and again - it's the appeal of pornography - the next image
will tend towards the exhaustion of pornography, the turning-away from the
image effluvia.
 *  nikuko-america wants to show you her cunt
It is the substance in pornography that defuges; the image on the level of
the symbolic which unconsciously appertains to the unconscious. In porno-
graphy, not to mention adulterers, oral sex fanatics, consumers of the
other, their _place(ment)_ - as if the pornographic would, in the first
instance, impoverish all of us.
 *  nikuko-america wants to put your hot cock in his hot pussy
No one wants pornography; no one looks at it: terrorist manuals on the
Net, child pornography, and anarchic hackers whose pornographic breath is
held until the orgasm from which one never recovers.
 *  nikuko-america wants to swallow your hot cock
Off with pornographic photographs taken of my bloodshot eyes. Get it over
tumescence. The Web pornography industry is bringing in more than a change
of pornographic images, and general tropologies of fetishization. I down-
loaded pornographic image after image tonight, from several newsgroups of
amateur pornography for example. The roughness and irresolution of low and
more pornographic - the waves practice your imaginary stroke at my frieze:
my pornography goes unnamed, it's that which stirs these remarks of an eye
- a pornography based on the revelation of planes.
 *  nikuko-america wants you to squeeze his breasts
Pornography happens when a pornographic picture no longer 'works,' or when
you're an anime and pornography entwined at numerous junctions (all across
the playing-field); so does pornography become an intrinsic part of every-
day flirting with xxx segueing into disbelief and pornography. My work is
not pornography, titillation, stories, parables; it is not a habitual cra-
ving, in the depth of the night, pornographic and luxurious, pornography
... she arches, u beneath, pornog, its penis, its vagina, u Tiffanyalan
 *  nikuko-america wants to drink your cum over his breasts and twat
The membrane appears in the guise of discarded pornography; one is thrust
into pure consumption, no longer beneath the guise of another pornography,
always exhausted. If emission is the order of pornography, spew is the
order of pornography used and reused, raised to the order of the other of
a splayed pornography; the screen/user into praxis spewed and wasted. Both
seep, leak, transgress, both are discarded, and the delay, this endless
procurement reminiscent of pornographic flow, is discarded (and the consu-
mer readied for a new sexual pornography); both regimes imply a continuous
reinscribing of orgasm wasting the pornographic image; turning-away or
face-to-face projects again. No pornography whatsoever! It's harmful!
 *  nikuko-america wants to show you his cock
Pornography of the dead opens inconceivable flesh encapsulated only in im-
mense occasioning circulations. A mass seeps through Pornography from 
Revolution, its Holes in one Binary, a Time-Waster Killing our Children.

.commun

at only 100- or 200x, the microscope, examining filter effluvia from the
aquarium, reveals a world of life around the feeder dead brine shrimp:
numerous protista, worms of various sorts, rotifera. some of my favorite -
stentor, amoeba, various ciliates, for example. lots of blue-green algae,
disconnected cells. too tired to identify the ciliates or worms, but think
at least some are nematodes. all of these are relatively small - the
amoeba is by far the largest (even though some of the others are mutli-
cellular); here's a whole other buried ecology. there are similar ones at
the bottom of the tank, beneath the artificial rock, among the crevices
between the pebbles, on the tank sides - in fact anywhere there's a
surface or hold-fast domain. the pebbles, fossils, and artificial rock,
all have miniscule worms, possibly tubularia.

all this is to say a repetition of the basic lesson: that larger life-
forms are relatively transparent, planetary, to organisms on this scale,
that our cognition means absolutely nothing, that we are floating harbors
of nourishment, that life has a persistence having nothing to do with
vertebra, intelligence, even sexuality. these organisms and their like
inhabit our surfaces, our gut, our tear-ducts, our excrement, our very
cells, our dna, our sequences, major and minor, our redundancies. we are
no more visible to them as we are to neutrino flooding. we live in the
great slosh, and you need only a microscope to see it. von Foerster, i
think, talks about negation as a primary characteristic of organisms in
general, a defining characteristic - and watching these *zoa, avoidive
behavior on all levels is clear; afterwards, i return them to the tank.
think of it this way: bits and bytes and protocols surround us; we're
invaded on the level of informatics by computer and other, more basic,
viruses - those which characterize digital behavior and phenomenology in
general. and "just so," we're invaded as well on the level of material
physiology by equally invisible organisms; even our culture and speech
(for that matter) are transparent; we're transparent through and through,
communalities flooding these very words i write, you read.

ANSWER TO THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION


( Behind this text is the phenomenological structure of truth. 

"Speech is subsumption architecture drawn out by conflicted local environ-
ments (i.e. fold-catastrophic), with the symbol responsive, not to commu-
nality, but to the splitting of the referent. Normal speech is a reduction
to filtered, edited meaning; the resulting singularity is a necessity,
given the temporal linearity in our perceptual universe. Full speech is
schizophrenic, dangerous, pulling in too much environment, too little
processing and filtering; it disturbs the fundamental order of the sub-
ject. Full truth is similar, fuzzy, multi-dimensional; what passes for
truth is constraint. (Constraint is communal, multi-vocal, again a path
through catastrophic space.) Everything begins with the referent tied to
human survival, processed and already demarcated prior to name, syntax,
semantics. Semantics subsumes subsumption, creating a phenomenology of a
univocal representation of the real; naive realism is its masquerade."

Theory in 13 Lines (according to my telnet window protocol)

Speech is not subsumption architecture drawn out by conflicted local
environments (i.e. fold-catastrophic), with the symbol responsive, not to
communality, but to the splitting of the referent. Normal speech is not a
reduction to filtered, edited meaning; the resulting singularity is not a
necessity, given the temporal linearity in our perceptual universe. Full
speech is not schizophrenic, dangerous, pulling in too much environment,
too little processing and not filtering; it dis notturbs the fundamental
order of the subject. Full truth is not similar, fuzzy, multi-dimension-
al; what passes for truth is not constraint. (Constraint is not communal,
multi-vocal, again a path through catastrophic space.) Everything begins
with the referent tied to human survival, processed and not already dem-
arcated prior to name, syntax, semantics. Semantics subsumes subsumption,
creating a phenomenology of a univocal representation of the real; naive
realis notm is not its masquerade.

they do not trust or do not not trust us, no they are there, they are in
theyr names and language, we do carry on as we were biden, it is hard to
feel what dryness must but :such a respon sibilness we have to these
Creatures we would not turn over their tank which has been gyven us to
gard and they do not kno this, they live and leave their quarters as
usual, day to day, and we do watch from afar and they do not see:smashed,
water all over the floor, the fish, crayfish, no idea what had happened,
just as we, our humanss, do carry the torch for tha higher god that might
one recompense do the syme to us, which would be dreadful, as light and
dryness and no atmosphere sufocates our lungs while we crawl in that
unbidden light:we do care, we do care so : we do not do this, we might do 
this:we would not do this: they do not know: we do not:lord we Do pray for 
us:that we know:that we do not know
