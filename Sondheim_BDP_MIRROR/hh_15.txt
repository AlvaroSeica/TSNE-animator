Here is a lovely error message I just received (some specific info
changed):



Your message was not delivered to ab@cix.compulink.co.uk
For the following reason:
Could not create users mail basket

This result may also be due to the user
not existing on the system

You may also find that you now have a mail message
in your outbasket that is marked unread to this user and
as it was not sent to the user it will remain unread
You can remove this entry by the command
delete <nnn> where nnn is the message number
