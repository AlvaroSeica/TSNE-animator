Virtual Reality, 1971


[In 1971 I created a videotape called "4320" using Charles Strauss' pro-
gram for hypercube projection at Brown University. The machine was a Meta-
4, controlled by keyboard and joystick. Two women (Andrea Kovacs and Beth
Cannon) sat at the console in turn, and attempted to control the projec-
tion - driving it first orthogonally, to produce a cube - driving the cube
orthogonally to produce a line - and shrinking the line to a point. The
women "inhabited" 4-space. I reproduce part of the dialog and then a short
text accompanying the tape, both published in Clone zine. The story brings
out issues of patriarchy, mastery, and proper names that are still rele-
vant.]

1. "Ok, drive that back into three-space now. Wait, it's still moving in
four." "I'm losing control, there's a bending --" "Try the lower console."

2. "It's doubling for some reason, looks like you're sliding along another
axis somewhere." "It won't stay still for me. Hold it. No. There, hey
where's that coming from?" 

3. "Now take it from there to the maximum extension - Petrie projection of
the cube first. (Try for the hexagon.) Like driving lessons." "Just a sec-
ond, how much have we got here..." "Wow, you're wildly fourspacing it. Lo-
wer console again." "Wait.." "Ok, now shade it."

4. "Where are you going?" "Nowhere... I don't know."
