I am getting old, tho I don't want to.


I am an American fighter in the Irak War, Sergeant Sang-sa.
I am not a Sang-sa, I am a Chung-sa.
Were you once a Pyong-chang?
Yes, but then I was a Ha-sa.
A Warrant officer or Chun-wi is not a warrant.
Corporal Sang-tung-byong?
That is not my name, but my rank.
Are there other Sang-tung-byong?
Yes, there are other Sang-tung-byong.
That is all, Corporal Sang-tung-byong.
Thank you, but Sang-tung-byong is not my name.
Are you called Sang-tung-byong?
Perhaps I am called Sang-tung-byong Corporal.
Is Corporal your name?
No, I do apologize, but Corporal is not my name.
Were you an I-tung-byong, Private?
I am not a Private, I am a Corporal.
Is a Corporal a Private 1st class?
No, a Corporal is not a Private 1st class, because a Corporal is 
Sang-tung-byong, and a Private 1st class is Il-tung-byong.
Were you ever a Petty Officer?
Il, I, Sam, Il, I, Sam.
I am the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
I am called Yon-hap Ch'am-mo Ch'ong-chang and I am in charge of everyone 
in America.
Are you in charge of a Company Commander?
I am in charge of a Company Commander, that is to say, a Chung-dae-chang, 
and a Chung-dae-chang and I have made a flank attack, that is to say, a 
ch'uk-myon kong-kyok in an offensive, that is to say, a kong-se.
Did this occur during the hu-myon kong-kyok, that is to say a rear attack?
As the Yon-hap Ch'am-mo Ch'ong-chang or Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, I made sure this occurred with the proper sa-gi or martial spirit 
when I made a rear attack during the hu-t'oe or withdrawal.
Did you wear a helmet?
As an American Join Chief of Staff Chairman, I wore a helmet or ch'ol-mo.
Did you use a torpedo or o-roe?
Of course I did not use the o-roe in a demilitarized zone or bi-mu-chang 
chi-dae.
Did you not use the torpedo or o-roe during a chak-chon or operation?
I did not and I did not have a torpedo or o-roe?
You did not have a torpedo or o-roe?
Not even the Ch'ong-sa-ryong-gwan or Commander-in-Chief has an o'roe?
Not even the Yon-hap Ch'am-mo Ch'ong-Chang or Chairman of the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff?
Not even the Yon-hap Ch'am-mo Ch'ong-Chang.
Look, a rainbow or mu-ji-gae!

Confusion


It can be shown by straightforward substitution that the curves of parent 
and daughter activity cross at the exact time that the daughter activity 
is a maximum. [...] Parent Activity A1. Daughter Activity, A2.

I. Fast Daughter, L2 = 10L1, T2 = T1/10
II. Slow Daughter, L2 = .5L1, T2 = 2T1

The first daughter, Th, will grow into secular equilibrium with the U 
within a matter of days. This is illustrated by the "fast-daughter" (type 
I) curve of problem 9. After a few days we may consider the Th activity 
equal to the U activity, and go on to consider how the Pa grows in.

30 billion spam messages a day on the net.  that's five for every man,
woman, and child on earth. therefore i am covering for about eighty 30
billion spams per day of which i receive 80 and if you think of 5 per
person re: 30 billion roughly on earth then i am receiving for 16 people.  
let these 16 be: martha, jim, azure, terrence, johan, ki let these 16 be:
martha, jim, azure, terrence, johan, ki 30 billion spams per day of which

azure, terrence, johan, ki let these 16 be: martha, jim, azure, terrence,
johan, ki - there were also the four tarin quadruplets.

but i made an error: of which i receive 400 and not of 80 and therefore i 
am covering for eighty and not sixteen people, therefore let all sixteen 
people have quintuplets, i.e. the terrence quintuplets, johan quintuplets, 
etc. because this connection is already corroded, dare i say DOS attack?

now what is that about? someone is complaining - rocky when we need him.

his quintuplets?

recently the quintuplet quark states of course - there's a relationship.
10^42 or is it 10^74 spam = quantity of particles in the universe.
or is it atoms?
how do you measure virtual particles?

virtual quintuplets? alan's and azure's : the five:

the now


doomed to live in the present
which is not your present
you'll never know my present
doomed to live in my present
writing that before you never knew
now you know and i've moved on
or rather stayed exactly at the same place
doomed to live in the present
that present my living present
