.i am in this state of anti-war
  You are now ignoring everyone.
.i am in this state of furious protest
  You will now hear everyone again.
.i am in this state of inconceivable violence
  You are now ignoring everyone.
.i am in this state of eternal pacification
  You will now hear everyone again.
.by grace i am attentive
  Unknown command.
.listen to the murmuring of the world within and without
  You are already listening to everything.
.ah...
  Unknown command.
.i will leave after the statement of accreditation
  You are now ignoring everyone.
I am Alan, of none, really...
You say: I am Alan, of none, really...
and I am leaving after six decades on the face of this 
  and any other earth...
You say: and I am leaving after six decades on the face of this 
and any other earth...
