Madness -

The World's Oratorio -

country anarchy had, madness setting in, elsewhere, destruction, 
good it wasn't my own madness setting in, that it was elsewhere, 
the destruction of the madness of the body::: genetic acid 
redux; ontology and so much real existence:of madness of the 
body::: genetic acid

any madness whatsoever, among those orderly and placid masses 
that are lost as well; bytes are bedded in gone-worlds, madness; 
pretend otherwise, you will see the dance and madness of the 
Insomniac! Overfeed on hope and you'll sicken with madness. 
truth lies in madness and depression in a concussion: sometimes 
there is madness in contusion: what and clipped that monster 
devouring all sentient beings, pure faith, the violence, the 
more than one

   Jennifer:    The madness is upon us.
                We will all be dying in the madness.
   Jennifer:    The madness is here.
                Yay, though the madness is here,
(      the madness of the image
(      the madness of the light
(      madness of the image
(      madness of the light

isis-is: the signal

             trying to come to grips with annihilation when for 
example beheading occurs, not only to foment terror, but as an 
act of piety, as part of the natural order of things -

             a signal is sent, becomes furious, begins to 
dissolve, the dance is violent and sexual like a machine gun

             amounting to firing a gun but now up close, the 
taste of the gristle, trophy of the severed head, chopped 
hands, gouged eyes 

             anything that can be removed

             what does this, what is a response, what is this?
