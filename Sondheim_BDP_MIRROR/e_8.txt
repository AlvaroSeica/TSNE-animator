1: dreaming each other into being it remains stillborn everything said
carrying stratigraphy of flesh

2: without a campfire self-pity
wandering into one or another forest
what would it take to stabilize these letters i imagine
there would be no backspace delete or insert edit
with Mayan glyphs, it's this that makes all the differance
bowed down to the rock itself, inert and permanent excision
lucid,
but here and now these words bubble like the dead,
words froth and there is no tomorrow: everyone speaks, 
languaging's quantity increases exponentially; the curve
grapples with itself, an awkward tumescence
recorded once, with the letting of blood, in glyphs
strangled with permanence through which freedom and moss
alike

meaning cannot ascertain itself, surely, out of time. we are 
considering out of time, or time's rush, exhausted and dismayed.

so surely are these things kept liquid, thoughtless,
i can't think nor read enough as meaning crashes against
describing theory describing wonders beyond wonders
succumbed to the violence of language itself, 
there's nothing to be learned here in no man's land, all genders
drowned in coordinates, consensus, consonants, stoppages, 
stuttered rage of studied emptiness.

so surely are these things kept liquid, thoughtless,
i can't think nor read enough as meaning crashes against
describing theory describing theory beyond wonders
succumbed to the theory of language itself,
or the theory of violence, recuperated from consonant,
stoppage, rage of studied emptiness.
