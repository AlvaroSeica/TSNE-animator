There once was a jealous and lazy fox. He came across a grasshopper watch-
ing a group of ants prepare for the winter. The grasshopper was fascinated
- he had never done a day's work in his life. The ants were dragging
grapes to the entrance of their anthill, then shoving them in, until the
entrance was almost entirely blocked. Suddenly it would be freed, and the
grape would fall deep within the earth, to become a raisin for a winter's
feasting.

The fox thought the grapes tasted bitter as he ate the grasshopper, which
should have been watching his back. Since he had no articulated neck, like
the mantis, he would have had to stop his meditation on the antwork. But
why should he? The fox was extraordinarily quiet, avoiding the usual
sounds of hunters on the move. The grasshopper had no reason to be sus-
picious. The ants would have tasted bitter as well.
