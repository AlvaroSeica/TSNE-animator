An engine is anything which irreversibly transforms epistemology.



An irreversible transformation implicates the temporality of the subject.



Science is a tolerance-engine.



Before the nineteenth-century, something was true. Later, something was

true as-if (Vaihinger, even Bentham). Now, something is true within a

given.



An engine expands the domain of the given and contracts the tolerance.



An engine drives an engine.
