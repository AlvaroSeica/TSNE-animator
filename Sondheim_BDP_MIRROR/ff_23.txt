Face:It


A Dewar's advertisement in the New York subway, B train from Brooklyn to
the Waverly/Sixth Avenue Stop: 

"It's not so much the 'Chat Room' as it is the sitting-home-alone-by-
yourself part that concerns us."

There are six black and white photographs of a man and terminal from
above; he's bleary, haggard. These alternate down the car with a color
display (includes the name "Dewar's" flanked by glasses with icecubes)
and other texts/images.

You shouldn't drink alone.

The ad catches _perfectly_ the very definition of "haggard" here; I've
seen his face over and over again, on myself, on CuSeeMe males, and even
the occasional woman. It's the face of waiting, but it's the face of ex-
haustion. It's the face of trembling, but it's frozen, spasmed. It's lit
by the screen. It's overwrought, immobilized. It's aged, furrowed, but
it's ageless. It leers, displays itself, but it's sullen, withdrawn. 

It has nothing. It eats alone, drinks alone, sleeps alone. Its cock
twists and ruptures. Its eyes are dead. Even the corporate is forewarned,,
foreclosed, splits at the ad's wound. 

It's the mask of death, but it's the haggard mask. It's the mask of rage,
but it's the mask of withdrawal. It can hardly see the bottle. It doesn't
drink. It's _stuff._ It waits, empty. It blocks the phonelines with its
machine. It pumps the phonelines with waiting. It waits for nothing. It's
a waste, a loser, drivel, mush, shit. It's cloacal. The face rides the
frozen subway. Tonight on the way back the train went no longer.
