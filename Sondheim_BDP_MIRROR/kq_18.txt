(Skylark) Come sit closer to me, hold me just so.
(Bornmale) Mistress, I beg you to hold me against your breast.
(Skylark) My breast is yours, I order you to drink deeply here.
(Bornmale) How was your day?
(Skylark) I've been tired recently, feeling slightly ill, one of
my children is here.
(Bornmale) Mistress, I beg you whip me, for thinking of you so
when you are thoughtfully concerned for your sick child.
(Skylark) I will whip you repeatedly; you will learn to behave.
(Bornmale) You must teach me; I do poorly when I am not spanked.
I was a terror at school.
(Skylark) I was too, but no one noticed; I stood in the corner
and started fires :-)
(Bornmale) :-)
(Skylark) Smile when I tell you to. 
Bornmale hangs his head down feeling sorry and hoping for a 
deep and wonderful caress.
Skylark caresses Bornmale with a deep and wonderful caress.
(Bornmale) Thank you, mistress. I love being your slave. You 
always know just what to do.
(Skylark) I know what to do because you obey me perfectly and
attend to my every need.
(Bornmale) I want to fulfill your every need.
(Bornmale) Brb, the phone's ringing.
(Skylark) I've got to go wash up; she's conming over again.
(Skylark) I'll talk with you later; I'm sorry we coudln't 
continue. I have ideas for scening.
(Bornmale) Skylark? You signed off?
Bornmale tells Skylark he has returned for the scening.
