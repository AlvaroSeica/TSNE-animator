"'Their vision came all at once. Perfectly they saw, perfectly they knew
everything under the sky, whenever they looked. The moment they turned
around and looked around in the sky, on the earth, everything was seen
without any obstruction. They didn't have to walk around before they could
see what was under the sky; they just stayed where they were.' And there
is more: 

"'Their sight passed through trees, through rocks, through lakes, through 
seas, through mountains, through plains.' And finally:

"'They sighted the four sides, the four corners in the sky, on the earth,'
so says the Ancient Word. 

"Their limits, then, were those of the world itself. The only thing such
beings might miss would be something that lay outside what sky and earth
could comprehend - or 'skyearth' as the Book often has it written, bring-
ing the world to a single word. Or else these beings might miss something
that happened even faster than they could turn their heads to look around,
or look up in the air or into the earth. Whatever space may have been for
them, it was no more than turnings and twistings of their heads; there was
no need for the measures of hand or foot. Whatever time may have been, it
was no more than the time it took to do those twistings and turnings" ...
