Parable


Izanagi and Nikuko were crossing the famed Kintai bridge at Iwakuni. It
was an early summer morning, and both were lightly clad. Izanagi asked
Nikuko, have you ever lain in someone's arms, delirious with desire, all
day and night, unable to sleep or eat. Nikuko was silent. Izanagi con-
tinued, In such states it is impossible to think; enlightenment seems a
long way off. Nikuko was silent. Izanagi continued, Time seems to come
to a halt, space collapses. Nikuko said, Once. Izanagi said, One lives 
in a half-dream, half-alive state. Nikuko said, Once I was like that, in
the midst of making worlds; it was a mistake to create like that. Izanagi
asked, What happened. Nikuko said, I made this world and its humans; that
is why they are so much out of control, contaminated by the small spit
that remains from their creation. Izanagi said, That is the way of fet-
tered ghosts, half-covered in soot, half walking through mountains. They
use electricity nowadays, said Nikuko, and the mountains disappear. We
should have thought of that earlier, replied Izanagi. They continued on
their way across the spans.
