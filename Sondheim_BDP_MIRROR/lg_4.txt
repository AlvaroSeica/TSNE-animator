Turning a Joke into a Riddle


Consider the following joke:

"The child on the linoleum is burning. Whales make better margarine."

The humor lies in the juxtaposition, the relation to extinction and can-
dles, the presence of a floor to which no whale may succumb. But it is
not a riddle. Consider transformations based on omission:

"If a child burns on linoleum, what makes better margarine?"
Answer: "A whale."

"Which makes better margarine, a child or a whale?"
Answer: "It depends on what's happening with the linoleum."

The possibilities are endless. The riddle brings the listener into the
heart of the joke, enveloping speech and phenomena. It is as if the joke
adhered within the very fabric of the subject, suspending language, trans-
forming the world itself.

Almost any joke can be transformed in this fashion.
