i'm tired of this stuff. it doesn't make any sense. culling stuff from the 
net or operating system doesn't make art. the mystery's in the production, 
not in the stupidity of lists no one can interpret. sure, it's a 
cathechism - it makes the account go round, but so what? it's got no 
meaning by itself, any more than an automobile wiring diagram takes you 
someplace. codework is stupid this way; it's nothing more than a minor 
art. if you don't try for greatness all the time, you're insulting your 
audience. this is just absurd.
