The Visitor


What I want is a secret message come to me late at night 
it will make everything all better, better better forever
and I'll sleep just before receiving, wake to its arms, 
rites, and rituals, then return sleepy child child sleep
and I'll be cured of the hunger and the pain
and it will be from somewhere out there 
and full of promise, fecund, heavy with the weight of truth
pregnant with truth and beauty and goodness and truth and beauty
and I'll never have to write again
and my writing will be cured of itself, 
my fingers joined back to the hands that gave them birth
fingers joined to my hands, arms back where they belong

what we need, our faces back upon our bodies, recognized by one and all

and the message will come through late at night in the midst of the stars
nebulae circulating across the galactic internetworking
connecting us to the farthest planets and the farthest reaches 
the message will come through with healing grace upon its shoulders
upon its arms hands fingers
placed upon a beauty smiling face, broad blank face of a smiling angel
blank stare of a datagram traversing the backbone, routers, and bridges
salvation whore pimp datagram bringing love and final solutions
bringing presence brimming over with happiness for one and for all

and I'll never have to write again
and the questions will drop away and I will love my perfect lover
and my perfect lover will be by my side and I by hers
and we will join forever ever ever ever
and we will weld in fury and violence, earth turned to ashes
cosmos a pale blister, milky way a scar

and every page will remain white white white and blank eternal
like the broad face of a smiling angel
next to my receptive mind and body

and I'll never write again
