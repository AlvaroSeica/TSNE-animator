Zazen-Zen substitution sonnet

To write with sudden flare, as if conclusion
bombed or went awry, there's also nonsense ending
or something about mind's explosion, doesn't it
make you think of war, zazen-zen? because one en-
lightenment illuminates sky-tracers of single
one, others' mistaken kanji. What substitutions 
makes this salvaged one enlightenment? I'd say
"any and all," but none, here, or rather b for b,
c for c, d for d, and so through equivalence as
in sed 's/_x_/_x_/g' as general rule. But it's
applied. that which it makes zazen-zen. Over and
in repetitious order. No delight, but clearness of
this-world's mistaken kanji. Now war has stopped. 
Now a turn. Now the turns.
