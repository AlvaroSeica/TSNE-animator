Epitaph, Pretty Party Dress


Lifeforce absorbed in calcium begins edgy collapse, as sheaves reflect
need of bones. Once I walked these shores. Now memory serves potassium
interference; collapse is. Once I thought memory would serve me. That is
when I walked lake bed, picked stones, lived in cool light of Providence.
You must think energy energy. Absorption beats up on foolish words. Stones
continue centering of language. What I need, your drug. Veins stretched
out in thundering skies. I want to go to your dance with all you. I want
to bring my friends on what means. There are many talking. I need to know
talking. Sometime now I will in silence die. Calcium stone will fall and
failing building. Now I will tell time to all who listen. So loose energy,
need your party now. Party-club-dance.

I wanna see you in your new party dress. 
I wanna see you in your new party dress. 
I wanna crowd around. I wanna crowd around.
Let's have fun for me cause I'll be there for the fun of merry fun.
Let's have merry fun for good and sparkling talk and sound of drug.
Let me play for you. Let me play for you.
I wanna crowd around you. I wanna crowd around.
So listen party-club-dance in the pretty-party-dress!
Lemme loosen up! Let's have merry fun!
