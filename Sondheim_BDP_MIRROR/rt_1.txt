http://www.alansondheim.org/quikstudy.mp4 silent

sometimes i feel like the weather
like the weather looks like the weather looks at me
silent i am and i am feeling the looking great eyes
of grain and luster 

and you record and collect what you can and play back
and play up what you can this weather you see not the
gluon or the quark you see the scattering you see not
the boson you see the scattering and you learn to read
you learn to read the scattering carefully you note
the doublets and triplets carefully you note the
solitary sometimes i feel like the weather want to
forget the signifier mark forget the token forget the
bound boundary forget the binding forget incision want
to forget suture forget difference forget differance
forget deferment to the sky to the meridians of sky
to number numerical to decimal decimate sometimes i
feel like the weather unreading unthere sometimes
where the weather is i am sometimes i am unthere

 2 notes;
2 is played mainly on the two highest strings;
3 is added detuned brain-waves in post-production.

Little Jim

http://www.alansondheim.org/littlejim.mp4

Little Jim wanted to go to the big Ball Game.
Little Jim sat on the Goal Post and was very
happy. We cheered Little Jim. He was called
Little Jim because he played Goal Post Ball
at the Jim and the Jim was small but not as
small as Little Jim who fit inside when Goal
Post Ball was being On, which means when
there were many People around doing Things
that Little Jim was watching. Now You can
watch Little Jim and it is fun for You. And
it would be fun for Little Jim except but 
for he is watching.

Music: philosophical positioning / experimentation music

http://lounge.espdisk.com/archives/1008 (best)

What's clear is that living organisms and their place 
within a phenomenology of the cosmos is in the process 
of being determined, to increasingly fine tolerances, 
by molecular biologies, cosmologies, physics, and 
mathematics. The image-imaginary that results is on 
the order of a structured response undergoing 
increasingly fine tunings as a result. On this level, 
there is little to be said; how one, for example, 
interprets a multiverse is moot/mute and irrelevant 
- what is of value is the potential epistemology of 
universal splittings.

Musico-philosophical positioning

Music experimentation with the prayer of warding off death.

http://lounge.espdisk.com/archives/1009 (best)
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/mysolace91.mp3

[1. from before; 2. new and descriptive.]

2. What's also clear, in my own sound productions, is that what I give 
you, as gift or token, is an interval of lived-time, real-time, on my 
part; that what you hear is what I was doing, that this doing will 
continue long after I'm dead, until the file is erased. This lived-time is 
well-ordered on recording, and well-ordered on playback; if t0 < t1 < t2 
in the original, then t0 < t1 < t2 in the listening; all listening here is 
copy, and the original exists ontologically elsewhere, in the movement of 
flesh and mind, in the construction of the piece, which is the image of 
the piece. So in relation to my fear of death, which borders on the phobic 
or compulsive (I victimize myself with catastrophic thinking), I create 
these images, image-pieces, one after another; they are indicative, as I 
reiterate here, of _what I have done,_ _what I was thinking and doing,_ 
_what occurred during my intentionality directed in lived-time,_ between 
me and instrument and later post-production in order to produce a copy, 
which is the original which is a copy, as clear and lucid as possible to 
the original. (Of course in the future, these codecs may be played at 
other speeds, or not even recognized as music; that makes little 
difference. I've done what I can; this isn't science but the vagaries of 
creation, as if there were an open field replete with wavering protocols 
and decisions.) And below is a recording of the sung lisu tuned in 
fourths, with strings of equal width which is traditional for the 
instrument; in other words, the tuning is by tension alone, and the lower 
string has a 'whang' to it as a result. I learned as I played in the 
tuning, learned how to control the whang, how to bring it forward in the 
sound, how to handle it delicately enough so that it doesn't interfere or 
appear out of tune. I did this in real-time, lived-time, on the fly, which 
is what you are hearing, so part of what you are hearing is my thinking 
about this, as the rest of the world drops away, and I am able to continue 
living, at least a little longer.

Musico-philosophical detour

http://lounge.espdisk.com/archives/1010 (best)

3. searching for basis on instruments slightly detuned. I am an 
aural-audible wanderer; the sung lisu, smoothly born with a 
long shamisen-like fretless and unmarked neck, needs constant
adjustment in relation to the low string. Playing up-tempo can
only help create the illusion of coherency. The speed of the
world results in simultaneous fragmentation and suturing: make
the breathless mind, and the virtual becomes whole. The sarangi
is in-cohering with the tamburi, but there are way-points that
function momentarily, and the result is a wandering dirge in 
search of a non-existent fundamental ground. What occurs, just
as with the sung lisu, is something oddly reminiscent of daily
life, instead of closure by chord or speed at the end of more
traditional compositions. Think of the world and the nomadic,
and how often notes aren't hit on target, but are approached
as if structure were self-sustaining, although structure is
broken, peculiar, signifying the death of classical mathesis,
opening the maw of abjection, incoherency, tincture and odor
of collapse.

Combination, chora, cooling - philosophico-music experimentation

http://lounge.espdisk.com/archives/1011 (best)
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/allsolace.mp3

4. The mysolace experimentation pieces are combined into
a single production. Background is tamburi and electronic
tambura; foreground are the inchoate workings of alignment.
Since the originals were different lengths, the separate
pieces drop out one after another, until one alone emerges
and continues. So there are two backgrounds - the various
drones metaphorically providing an image of string theory,
of microwave background radiation (MBR), of groundwork -
and the backgrounds of string and woodwind instruments in
a constant state of virtual presence tending towards 
emergence. The thickness is lost. The remaining piece 
embodies drone, foreground (ghijak), and brain-waves at
two frequencies. The universe is simultaneously tuning-up
and emitting. What is chaotic is inchoate; what is inchoate
is not necessarily chaotic. In this work the chaotic itself
dissolves as a result of the mp3 (or any other - I have a
.wav that sounds clearer but is much larger) digitization
and compression; randomness underlies everything including
the real-world plucking of a string with all the implied
resonances at war with the physics of materials from 
string to surface to traveling waves to damping phenomena 
to the instrument's and performer's bodies to the weather
itself. And the universe? Simultaneously tuning-down and
emitting, entropic, always thinking in remote corners,
always at a loss.


Musical-philosophical syntactic change-she:

5. A proposal: to construct gender-orientation for all nouns
in English. There will be the 'usual' three genders: female,
male, neutral. Endings will be constructed as -she, -he, and
-it. Plurals are all the same: -they. We can then rewrite, 
for example:

New old saz and flute

http://lounge.espdisk.com/archives/1015 (best)

I finally found an absolutely amazing saz at Music Inn;
it's an Ahmet Tekeli, from Turkey, 1961. It needs some
slight adjusting and needed repair but sounds beautiful;
I recorded a long instrumental piece and a short coda.
Later, I recorded a short melody for tamburi and flute.
The saz is tuned low and sonorous roughly in fifths. Do
listen, at least a bit, at least for the beauty of the
instrument itself.

http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/melo3.mp3
 -- saz with six strings --
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/melo2.mp3
 -- violin with azure carter, tamburi --

the saz nut (where the strings leave the pegs and
enter the fingerboard) is so worn down that it's
impossible to hold the strings in place; as a 
result, two were taken out, and six remain. the
effect is that of a leaner, more despairing sound
i think. still the untempered scale works wonders
and the result is like the starts and stops of
everything else in my life.

along with this, there's a violin piece, mainly 
on the high string. - enjoy.
