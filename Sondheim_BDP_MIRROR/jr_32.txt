to the lists.)


Postphone


Postphone, speech after the fact, comes naturally, is difficult to say,
appease. Postphone, as if there were no lag; there is always lag, always
time for the packets to reassemble or process (Realaudio). One hangs ac-
ross the broken wires of the bridge; one dissembles.

Postphone, talking which is never natural, that of construct as well as
everything else/where in this space. The delay which doesn't appear as
such, postphone, the lure of the real=natural. Nothing can be farther from
the simulacrum of the truth than the simulacrum of the truth.

Postphone, earphone talking, capsule, I love my Net, I love my Net, I love
my Net. Make my day, Tender is the Night, Mourning becomes Electric. In
these early texts, in these early years.

Postphone, past the economy of distance towards imminence. Postpone, past
the economy of the voice as well, towards sound, immanence. As the witness
would tell you, hortatorical, ex-hortation. The be-speech of love here,
groundless (literally, "without a ground"). 

Communication is always already misrecognition; there is no possibility of
love except that which (in which) it stands (in) for. Postphone against
the borderlining of death: something that is never learned, something that
I am not here to _tell_ you.
