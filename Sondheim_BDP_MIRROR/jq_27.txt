   spreading jelly_____ open my breast______ splay my skins______
   cut me a river______ fuck me forever_____ sing to me my song__
   suck my nipple jam__ hold me, darling____ Murmur you aren't more,
   Alan. turn me into holy hole comfort me smoothly_ use my writing___
   wet my deep throat__ dry my labia milk___ kill me in lactate__
   hurt me, leave me___ wound me, suture me_ amputate my mind____
   burn me into coiling roll enter me quickly____ heal my birthing____
   love me with pain___ call me jennifer____ be me alan__________
   hug me, finger me___ kiss me, crush me___churn me into soiling hole
   open my womb________ play with my cunt___ lie with my cock____
   be with me be be me_ eat me or eat me____ cry me a river______
   write with placenta_ run with me alan____
   my twisted mind brings you
   whisper fuck to me__ shit for me darling_ talk to me jennifer_
   get to me quicken___ yearn for me alan___ pine for me jennifer
   piss for me alan____ come to me murmur___against my toiling folds
