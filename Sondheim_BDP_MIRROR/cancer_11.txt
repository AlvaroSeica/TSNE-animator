Some people really can't read about the problems others are having; for
others, including myself, it's healing, knowing there are other people
who feel like I do, that I may be crazy, but there are other crazies out
there and maybe we aren't that crazy after all. 

But sometimes as well people attack me for how I feel. I mean, how could
I be attacked, I'm just expressing myself, what I'm going through. I 
don't want to lay it on anyone else, I just want to be understood. I
don't even want sympathy, just maybe there would be someone reading what
I have to say who could understand me or help.

Very briefly, if it wasn't for these people on line, I would kill myself
a long time ago. These have been the people who have helped me when my
friends haven't wanted to even hear anything about me.

What do I have to do, have a crisis before anyone listens to me? I'm 30
yrs. old and I've supported myself since I was 15. I know how to get 
around but believe me, it's not been easy. And if I speak about malaise
or something that's not all that interesting, I mean how much of this
stuff really IS interesting, then no one wants to hear me.

Now at least I can say how I feel. Before I could never talk to anyone.
Now I have someone who will listen to me when I express my rage, when I
want to kill myself. I know I will be a better person. It is enough that
they listen, they don't have to say anything. My computer has become my
best friend.

I've learned that I can discuss things better with you online than I can
with my doctor, and I know now who to avoid when I need to look for a 
doctor. It has been very painful; it has been the most painful period of
my life and being on line has saved me time and again.

For once I could talk to my doctor and tell her that the medication was
not working, that it might have been a placebo for all I know. I said I
wanted to try something else, that I had the support of the online commu-
nity. I said nothing else mattered, my whole world gets caught up in this
or that medication and I know there is more to life than that.

Before, I was always taken by surprised; now I know when things are going
to get bad way ahead of time, and I can look for help from my doctor or
from online, and online people seem much more willing to listen.

Sometimes I'll feel so down, I could almost break things. Then to listen
online to people talking, I mean what they say to each other, how they
relate, sometimes it's really funny, and that helps a lot. I never thought
I could laugh so much from things coming over the screen but that's how
it is.

It is so spiritual to read these disembodied voices who never judge me,
and I know in real life they never would...

There are people out there in this town who could really benefit from all
this on line, they would learn how to better control themselves. I think
so many people in this culture are hurting or wrecked, I don't know where
it's all coming from, things are changing so fast, for everyone. I'm only
seventeen and I can hardly handle my life anymore, things going so fast
before my eyes, but when I get online I can really concentrate and slow
things down and learn to speak and think for myself.

You know, my daughter wouldn't talk to anyone, and we were both going
through a lot and it was coming on line that gave us the courage to speak,
first to others, and then to ourselves. It was so strange, we began by 
writing back and forth, honestly trying to deal with our feelings, even
though we were living in the same house. I think things like this are 
somehow more natural than being off line and walking warily around the
place, all of us fearful to speak to one another, we've got all those
defenses from being in the same place together too long.

Now this is what I have to say, don't use this as a crutch. If you do, 
what will you do when y2k comes along or your computer goes? It's a lot
more delicate than a friend, you have to know that. It's not a friend at
all, it's machinery that brings you voices that help you and console you
from time to time. But you can't count on it. I wouldn't count on it at
all.

This has replaced drugs of any sort for me; you can't believe what I was
like at one time. I couldn't even sit down without shuddering. Now I have
the time to even be with my parents a little, we're beginning to under-
stand each other. But it's because of this screen, nothing else. And they
know that. Someday maybe I can put this aside, but not for a long long 
time.
