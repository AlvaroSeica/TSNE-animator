/I can't deal with this, I try/





For Michael





It is not important to say what one would say, nor to think things

survive past silence. Nor have I ever seen your hands, heard your

voice up close, nor the light in your room. Nor would your room too

be silent there. What breaks, snaps, disconnects, remnants of letters

in remote files. There is a window and there is a tree and the tree

creates a beautiful shadow and coolness on the sill, where a plant

is, remains; so lovingly, you water it.



I miss your voice and the backtracking of ephemeral words on the 

screen, and now silence alone is utterable. There is a book on the

bed, and I read elsewhere, `Everyone has known such a situation in 

which the rift between the saying and the said opens up. A situation

in which the saying, essential and imperative, separates from the

said, which somehow it no longer orders and hardly requires.' 



The body is fragile as the Net is fragile, motions, nodes, unavoid-

able toxins, and the body is irreal as the Net is irreal, but the 

body is all we have to offer. The body leaves speech and leaves 

speech behind, and finally speech is abandoned.



At the limits of the body, speech is abandoned, death sinks in, the

Net is hidden speech. And at the limits, cries and murmurs are heard.

Broken, disconnected, this is all we have to offer.



The plant, which one will imagine, will need water, which one will

imagine, water, in order to imagine to survive.



You would have loved that book, the reading of it, your new new book,

the tiniest thing, in the shadow of the plant, your room, this open 

light
