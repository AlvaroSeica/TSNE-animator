	there are people on this list should never know
	people on this list who should never know
	my name/or the air i swim through falling down
	falling down the stair: there's air down the stair
	i fall through a cradle down a crib: swallow me!
	lips of the air hear and obey yes they do
	lips of the air do right wallow me in the cushion
	of the air wired on the stair where the people stare
	who should never know what i do or where i go
