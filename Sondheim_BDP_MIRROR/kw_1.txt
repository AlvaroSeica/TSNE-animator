phenomenology of internal time consciousness within online worlds,

by Jennifer Jenn Jenn Jenn



about going out and leaving
about leaving, there are two clocks next to my computer
they are westclox clocks
they are drowse dialite clocks
both plugged into the east coast electric grid
both registering five minutes until two o'clock
(of the clock) more or less and
i'm glad always to see the _hands_ in sync
you should see them! still in sync!
this give me reason to be alive, waiting
for just one of them to take off or go to sleep
just like that! - you know the feeling, suddenly
everything's askew!
wow!
