It has already been stated that witches can afflict men with every kind of 
physical infirmity; therefore it can be taken as a general rule that the 
various verbal or practical remedies which can be applied in the case of 
these infirmities which we have just been discussing are equally applic- 
able to all other infirmities, such as epilepsy or leprosy, for example.
(Kramer and Sprenger, Malleus Maleficarum, 1484)

Are witches nothing but sped-up humans? Last night I had a dream; E. and I 
were writing a tragedy when suddenly I appeared as a stand-up comic before 
an audience. I said, "I'm glad to see you all have your foreheads!" - At 
which point I woke up, laughing and laughing.

Humans are slowed-down witches. When a human laughs, whole years pass. It 
is a known fact in the animal kingdom: Only humans have foreheads. 

"The furnace of his skin exhibited a leprous appearance, and his eyes, 
wild glowing and deep sunk in his head, glaring dismally all around, 'Let 
me measure the moon,' said he, ''tis full of marrow, faugh! but O this 
torrent of lobsters--stop them, they curl the Heavens. Bottle up the war 
in a cornfield, and put my vote in hell. Hold me--the room is in flames 
and the castle totters, what a serpent is the minister, he has stung 
mankind--I am a crocodile.' He now caught hold of the bed cloathes and 
giving a dreadful shriek, EXPIRED."
(William Beckford, The Elegant Enthusiast, or, Modern Novel Writing, 1796, 
quoted in Archibald Bolling Shepperson, The Novel in Motley, A History of 
the Burlesque Novel in English, 1936)

THE MACHINE IS ALWAYS ON




Access Grid, West Virginia University, 2 a.m. Sunday morning

The Access Grid running in room 109 in the middle of the night, no one 
around, but broadcasting the empty classroom and its resonance of memory 
held just for a moment, just at the hinge of forgetfulness, the room shall 
sail like a great ship of state into uncharted waters of futures darkened 
with war, food and fuel crises, extinctions, think for a moment of this 
small place signaling everywhere and nowhere in particular, signaling 
steady-state, updating on version 3.1 perhaps twenty times a second, 
saying nothing, silence, nothing and more silence -

Logout / Fallout


(I'm speaking about 'logout' much as 'fallout' at the ELO conference this 
week; below is the text that inspired the videos, which will 'represent' 
me (as well as either Skype or SL) there, since I don't have enough funds 
to travel. Logout as fallout - the metaphor isn't mentioned below, but 
in/forms like all radiations. In modernity, premodernity, whatever, on/off 
was well-defined, even with the corrosion of axiomatic mathesis i.e. 
Tarski, Godel, Skolem, Church, etc.; a light-switch turned something on, 
then off - a light-switch in other words is a simple memory on the 
occasion of a single bit. Today, computers are left running, identities 
are stolen, one might jackin, jackoff, one machine or body, then another; 
micro-controllers run continuously just like computer locks or whatever 
holds volatile memory in check; one might login with several identities, 
etc. On a MOO, when one left, the avatar body went to a body bag; on SL, 
unless otherwise accounted for, the body disappears. Now, the virtual body 
or emanent is also the real physical body in the true world; login/logout 
are blips or momentary interruptions in redirected consciousnesses. This 
radiation treatment holds for the post-industrialized world at best; let's 
not make too much of this momentary ontology/epistemology. We're jackedin 
jackedout - we flicker, we're flicker-consumers in fact and fancy and the 
imaginary as bandwidths appear to increase and we can't get enough of 
either each other, our movies, our games, our entertainments. Earthquakes 
and monsoons crash-land the true world in the true world, crash-land 
bodies and emanents equally, however you divide your categories.)

CADRE-L.ZIP COMPRESSION COMPLETED 1332 BPS. EOF. LOGOUT CLARA-GEORGE.

"Logging out"
Abstract: Alan Sondheim will demo. Leaving site behind, physically,
electronically, psychoanalytically, electrically, socially, exhaustively.

Logout is the collapse of _ascence_ (Jon Marshall's term for the problem- 
atic of neither present nor absent on an email list); it signals a change- 
of-state of the ab/user (carpal tunnel, exhaustion, boredom, orgasm, task 
completion, defuge): LOGOUT IS EQUIVALENT TO DEATH UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.

I'M NOT HERE. I NEVER HAVE BEEN HERE.

Logout is cutoff, absolute split. A logout inscribes an absolute inscrip- 
tion: A|B, let's say Sheffer stroke NOT BOTH A AND B - which doesn't mean 
for example that there's not a C such that A and C in a rather abject or 
messy fashion. You're either online or offline, one way or another:

On the other hand you might keep the machine running, what of that? And 
you're logged in, jacked in, permanently, but you're not there, not there 
at all.

Defuge sets in; you're exhausted with the possibilities, they don't mean 
anything to you, you're taking a trip somewhere, the machine's left 
behind, still on, humming away...

Or bravo, someone's stolen your identity, now you're logged in, there's an 
id number, maybe parent and root, 
sondheim:*:4564:99:Alan Sondheim:/net/u/6/s/sondheim:/usr/local/bin/ksh
maybe something else, who or what is that thing, bot, that's running the 
thing. Maybe I sign off Second Life or a MOO and you'll find me in a body 
bag, maybe I'm still there, maybe I'm still around not logged out at all.

It's all a mess, WHERE ARE YOU in Facebook, MySpace? Increasingly YOU 
remain logged in, beyond the machine; you remain there, transfixed, your 
passwords and names in login memory.

Debris: You don't logout, you wither: Consider all those remnants of MOO 
objects that remained years after the user's disappeared. Cyberspace fills 
with debris; THE DEBRIS IS YOU and each and every Other. 

Culture is never as clean as it seems to be, and this unseemliness is the 
fundamental character of culture.

THE MACHINE IS ALWAYS ON

ii.

Think of on/off as intrinsic to inscription, fundamental to dyadic phenom- 
enology to the extent that one can consider dyads as _processes,_ the 
production of x|~x for example. This inscription is characteristic of org- 
anisms in general (see Heinz von Foerster); one might locate the ego at 
the hinge or juncture. The juncture configures, emits, spews meaning; 
inscriptions must be maintained. Thus an on-switch, logon, requires power 
for its continuance (yes, this is elemenatary); logoff, beyond the immin- 
ent action, construes annihilation. There is no guarantee that one who has 
logged off will log on again. And as we have seen, logon figures presence, 
which is demarcated; logoff figures nothing; this parallels the idea of 
'the fragility of good things' in catastrophe theory - there are many more 
ways for things to fail, than to succeed. 

I want to point out here the debt to Hermann Weyl, who located the last 
remnants of the ego at the juncture of coordinate axes in physics - i.e. 
the placement of an origin or null point, which is arbitrary and conven- 
tional and points to nothing more than a (theoretical) placement by a 
sentient being - "I say, things begin here," so to speak, whether zero or 
Jerusalem.

It's the ego, sentience, that holds inscription, on-off, together. But 
everything corrodes, decays, dis/eases, dis/appears. I'd argue that such, 
this regime of abjection, is fundamental to the world, ("Get lost and 
die.") at least the world as we know it. Log in to the digital, out to the 
analog; in to neural networking, out to the plain. 

The ego gets lost in _the process._

Emanent


'The skull-holder was not really so, but was a nirmana form of 
Heruka, who said, "In this life you must write the six main 
texts and in the _bar-do_ period you will attain the very highest 
siddhi." The acarya replied,

 "When pressed beneath your feet, even my lower 
 winds vanish.
 By your kind mercy, please withdraw your left 
 leg!
 If your nine-fold crest ornaments are kept
 straight, even the Brahma-realm vanishes.
 Please remain with your head moving but a little!
 If your hands are kept straight, the guardians of
 the four quarters become terrified.
 By your kind mercy please withdraw your hands
 a little!
 O noble one, as your body is in a dancing pose
 and is purposefully maintained,
 I bow down before you with faith and an excess
 of reverence!"'

Here very splay of the real? In such a fashion incisions, fashion, ges- 
ture, languagings, and what continually emerges is the good-old-fashioned- 
real, Beau-Brummel-Roseland messy messy fashion. You're either online or 
offline, one way or another: dresses for infinity are bypassed in this 
fashion; the systems are both functional and must be created anew - each 
time one moves string and creates the appearance of arousal, nothing more, 
such wonderful kostumes.

Here's the old culture of the unconscious.  

Indeed it has been abstracted from all concretion in such thoroughgoing 
fashion that one understands the endless worry about embodiment of ideas.  
The body does not embody ideas; it more accurately is ideas, matter, and 
energy that may pursue the same erotic, fantastic fashioning of the social 
system, unbelievably uncontrollable, the very splay of the real. Nikuko's 
writing begins with Askher's writhing on hir bohdi.

He signs hir, she signs hirself. Writing doesn't begin, it dozes, a high- 
wire act of haute couture. The energy skimming surfaces, burrowing into 
them. Jennifer runs off at the mouth, going on about fashion, Askhir's 
doing what he always doze and philosophy Okkurs.

Jennifer's mouth runs, Jennifer runs on Askhir, Nikuko says "wayward", 
"nice", "feminine", "lovely", "used", "fashionable", "small", "inci- 
sions, gestures, cuts, surgeries, sutures, surges."

Nikuko fashions hir texts and where's hem, pornography with absinthe 
organs, Schlemmer wrytes about the photoplay. Nikuko's back (is) in the 
imaginary, it's all the splay of the reel - trainers, gym memberships, 
fashionable clothing, pebbles...

siddhi pose-performance by Nikuko 


This is preparation for object attachment. Fashion: Silhouette for posing 
in combination with minimal blue pattern for orientation.

Object attachment buries avatar bodies. Spatially, the body is lossy; 
dynamically, behavior remains to conjure the semblance of purposeful 
action. Here, Nikuko orients herself, poses periodically.

The pose is drawn out of the dynamics; the spectator, in the pose, pro- 
ceeds as if the narrative moment continued literally for all intents and 
purposes. The pose is the ridge or hinge of movement, the pause designat- 
ing the other, the viewer, designated by the viewer - part of a system of 
distribution. The pause ensures the viewer that the body is not the locus 
or victim of seizure. Every pause is a pose, every pose a pause, both 
intertwined with intentionality.

The pose is given as a gift, is for the other, is oriented; the orienta- 
tion of the pose defines the stance of the other in inverse relationship 
to occidental landscape perspective in which the vanishing-point might be 
considered the locus of the viewer as well. But the pose draws in, puck- 
ers, the vanishing-point, which becomes a plane and punctum of intimacy.

Nikuko poses, there is no one in sight, but there is the camera, here 
literally one of obscura, that obscure little object A of desire for and 
by Nikuko, above all for Nikuko. 

One of us moved the other, one of us aroused the other to action, to the 
recording-booth, to the wide-screen, to the embrace of the other who is 
identical, not equivalent, to the self-selving occurring, not to mention 
the dynamics of the same. 

Ah, I reply, I can finally see her face.

Access Grid resonance and selenite filtering


For us at AG, an exciting group of videos/images!

This has been a dream: to bounce a video signal repeatedly around the 
world, creating video feedback as the signal resonates with itself. On a 
laptop, my video camera received an image from the West Virginia 
University Access Grid that bounced from the Asia Pacific Access Grid 
Lobby in Queensland. My camera sent the image back to the APAG Lobby where 
it was transmitted and picked up by a camera on the WVU Access Grid. The 
camera transmitted the image to the Asia Pacific Access Grid node, 
whereupon it bounced back to my laptop, where it was received ...

A similar looping was created using the Argonne National Laboratory Access 
Grid Lobby in Chicago. Another looping used two cameras and transmissions 
from the WVU Access Grid across to Argonne and / or the APAG; the looping 
was picked up by the laptop which sent the image back through the Lobby to 
WVU where it was inserted (medium against large) into one of the WVU 
images ....

I wanted a sense of the distances covered. We did ping and traceroute and 
found that while Argonne came back around 38 ms and Queensland hit some- 
where around 152 ms, the looping through the latter seemed considerably 
faster. 

The first of the files below is a series of stills from the whole process.

The second is video feedback with the usual tilted camera and infinite 
regress circling the planet.

The third is a somewhat steady-state blob of light, oddly breast-shaped, 
that pulsed and sometimes disappeared on the screen; again, this was built 
up through / by planetary circulation.

The fourth is Azure Carter singing with room and Access Grid resonance 
through Argonne; she's locally on four different cameras, and the reson- 
ances bounce through the WVU AG room and across the network.

Finally the fifth video explores an odd quality of a selenite crystal 
which produces a series of rings for 'fuzzed' sources of light and color. 
One might think of this as a simulacrum of resonance as well.

Modeling, filtering, resonance, transmission (in recent work?) and bad 
theory -

Bad theory: Because distorting concept and process, constructing 'fit' 
where most likely there's none at all.

I want to transmit this. I am transmitting this.
I am applying a filter to this. I am filtering this.
This is resonating. I want to make this resonate. (I am resonating this.)
I am modeling this. This is a model. This is continuou modeling.
 -- I am continuously modeling this.

These terms are interconnected; they assume energy pooling and structure, 
and are processes with process control. The control structures divide the 
configuration into semantics (with internal syntactic control) and syntac- 
tics (with external semantic control). The latter is the control structure 
proper - a formal program or filter whose semantic control is an intention 
to harness, modify,, transmit, or otherwise control the former. The former 
might loosely be considered 'content,' i.e. on the plane of content, which 
necessarily emphasizes semantics - the sememe of the content - that relies 
on internal syntactics to configure the sememe for others. This is a false 
model of course since the content seeps through both semantics and syntac- 
tics, but these domains are still 'somewhat' uncoupling; similarly, cont- 
rol structures are entangled between intentional semantics and process 
control itself. All of this is clear in transmission and filtering; the 
latter might be considered a form of transmission itself, although it is 
usually taken to refer to a cutting-away of tranmission contents. Like- 
wise transmission can be considered a form of dynamic filtering which 
parcels and configures content dynamically from one to another site. 
Resonance is an internalized filtering and transmission tending towards 
the best of all possible (local) worlds; it achieves this as a steady- 
state maintained (other than at temperatures near absolute zero) by an 
external energy source which keeps the resonance alive. Otherwise reson- 
ance, like transmission, is dampened and dies out. Filtering in this 
regard may be considered passive; a filter need not consume external 
energy for maintenance, but may just gate whatever content comes through. 
Finally, modeling - not models - may be considered a continuous process of 
adjusting to the world; resonances are appearances of entities that seem 
somewhat steady-state. Modeling transmits a series of models-in-process, 
behavioral dynamics, flux; filtering is at the heart of modeling, shaping 
whatever raw data comes into the process. It would be literally fitting to 
establish a procedural dynamics moving from (modeling filtering) through 
(transmission resonance) but this seems problematic; all that can be said 
is that these processes are all involved in situating the subject dynami- 
cally in the world, and are intentionally configured and active within the 
digital. (Resonance itself is analogic, I think; while it operates digit- 
ally, through positive feedback it might break out of any potential well 
designed to contain it. Of course this depends on the variety of resonance 
- and all of this points, I believe, to the above as bad or broken theory, 
groping at something and groping in the wrong direction.

nikuko swallows dirt

dirty nikuko.

nikuko transforming into landscape because she wants to become part of the 
world of second life so she can never be removed until the entire corpora- 
tion folds sometime in the future. nikuko encumbered by landscape because 
she wants to crawl away from the rocks towards some better future life. 
nikuko embedded into landscape because she wants to sleep the long long 
sleep while there still is silence in the world. nikuko talking to herself 
because there is no one to be her tiny friend or listen to her sobs. 
nikuko embracing landscape because she wants to open herself up to the 
earth and dirty orgasm. nikuko in the void of landscape. nikuko within the 
abyss of landscape. nikuko in the chaos of dirt. nikuko wants to swallow 
the landscape and disappear. nikuko in ecstatic orgasm upon her discovery 
that it is all one ontology. nikuko in overwhelming orgasm having discov- 
ered it is all one epistemology. nikuko doesn't know where her energy 
comes from or the light that illuminates the rocks. nikuko doesn't know if 
she's a stone or a cliff or granite or schist. nikuko doesn't know she 
doesn't know and she's not about to find out. nikuko in unbelievably 
ecstatic enormous and overwhelming orgasm.

Eras/sure

What we're doing produces (is the production of?) artifacts (processes?) - 
video, audio files, live video and audio performance, online video and 
audio performance, live performance, texts, programs, images - everything 
in other words that doesn't rely on offline material construction on the 
order of photographs, etchings, paintings, engravings, sculpture, instal- 
lations, multiples, printed books. What we're doing relies on both process 
and electronic transmission; the Access Grid works for example are proce- 
sses resulting in various digital formats and copies but otherwise no 
hard copy. What we're doing is scholarly to the extent that it examines 
the self-body-image - not the image in terms of symptomologies or emotion- 
al processes, etc., but the very inhabiting of the body itself - something 
that it's almost impossible to quantify or describe, Levinas, Husserl, 
Merleau-Ponty notwithstanding. The work reconfigures the very foundations, 
backgrounding, of experience. What would a world be like within which 
movement and memory structures were drawn out by the substitution of tan- 
gent for sine, structures that were then redrawn in to the experiential? 
We have no interest in display or aesthetics beyond that which tilts or 
topples presuppositions. Our scholarship as applied to examination is 
irreducible, irreproducible, irresistible, irregardless; our scholarship 
requires your presence, near or far, in relation to the camera, micro- 
phone, screen, performance space, online node. What we're doing is neither 
science nor psychology, but an intermingling which insists on the history, 
memory, and inhabiting of the human or otherwise body. We will use any 
available technology and performativity to arrive at the place of this 
body, the place of mind, history, and memory. We will eliminate the 
preposition 'of' in phrasing 'memory of,' 'history of,' 'psychology of,' 
'philosophy of.' We will conjoin coupling into flux, striation, flow, 
emission, spew. We will consider sources only as aftermath, and destina- 
tions only as they disappear in the rearview mirror of the mind. We insist 
that our knowledge is populist, open to everyone, that memory may be 
seeing, that looking may be thinking, that observing may be philosophy, 
that observing is always philosophy. We emphasize the look of the world is 
its origin all the way down, that looking requires nothing whatsoever, 
neither technology nor organ. We will dwell within breathing, breathe all 
possible worlds, collapse them with a gentle insistence on continuous 
withdrawal. We present artifacts and processes from the flattening of 
these and other surfaces. We understand that artifacts are carapaces, that 
a certain hardening always occurs in transmission, that hardening is never 
the thingings or processings themselves, nor thingings or processings 
otherwise. We neither consider this an aesthetics, nor an aesthetics of 
withdrawal, not even a silence or silencing; instead we might murmur some- 
thing about background once again, not even that, except under erasure. We 
operate under erasure, our work is under erasure, always beyond the Pale, 
always beneath consideration. Consideration is under erasure, everyone 
operates as if the Pale has disappeared, thought is under erasure ...


Writing habits


When I write, sooner or later the piece seems finished to me; it then is 
placed at the end of an ongoing 'collection' file that is placed on 
http://www.alansondheim.org ; the most recent is 'pr.txt.' I work on 
additions to these collections until they total anywhere from 80k - 100k, 
at which point the next in the series is started. I began with Net0.TXT, 
Net1.TXT, etc., for about 10; then there were several named files. 
Finally, the alphabet was used. The result is an irregular marking system 
which has settled down in an orderly fashion for the past 100 or so 
collections; 'pr.txt' follows 'pq.txt' and will precede 'ps.txt.' There 
can be between 20 and 80 individual pieces in one of these collections.

The individual segments generally follow whatever line of inquiry I'm 
working on at the moment, with numerous exceptions. At one point I spoke 
of 'long waves' and 'short waves' to indicate thematic movement through 
the mass of collections. A long wave might be Nikuko or defuge; a short 
wave might be a particular Access Grid resonance configuration which is 
exploited for a while.

These texts are heavily edited and spell-checked with ispell; unfortuna- 
tely, errors inevitably creep in. In my last text, I wrote 'my' instead of 
'may,' 'scholar' instead of 'scholarship,' and had a misplaced dash, the 
result of re-justifying after some corrections. I hope these errors aren't 
misleading, but are understood only as slips of the tongue leading nowhere
at all. They're not caught by ispell, and they're not caught by me.

I try to keep the average individual piece length to 43 lines, although it 
may range from 10 to 300 or so. I send these out once a day at least; this 
is my compulsion, and if I don't feel I've completed work for the day - 
and completed work at that - I find myself, like now, unable to sleep, 
cursing myself for being human so to speak.

The compulsion has to be be coupled with necessity, the 'natural' contin- 
uation of a series. I attempt to balance practical/production works with 
theoretical ones; sometimes the two accompany each other, and sometimes 
they're simply contiguous, as with the recent series of butterflies mating 
which I found fascinating; I hadn't seen this particular ritual before.

The texts are almost always written, as this one is, online at panix.com 
in the Pico editor in a shell account; the font is mono-spaced courier. 
There's a sense of urgency for me in this accountancy which is maintained 
only by a live connection; as I've written before, I recognize the server 
load and panix community which is almost always present in the background 
and accessed through the 'w' or 'who' or various other commands.

Once written, the file is sent from my home directory to my Pine email, as 
well as added to the current large text file. The file is almost always 
named 'zz' which places it at the end of a sorting; sometimes it's moved 
to 'ww' if I'm afraid it will be accidentally erased. If I'm processing 
the file, I move between 'zz' and 'yy.' If I'm working in the midst of a 
long file, I use 'zzzzz' for a bookmark. When the file is completed, I do 
an edit, an ispell, and a 'wc' word/line/character count before it's sent 
out through Pine.

The style varies from one text to another; one major characteristic is the 
presence or absence of capital letters. If the text is to be 'breathed' as 
if spoken with the words run together, or presented as flow or emission 
itself, I'll use small letters only. If the text is traditional or 
genre-oriented, capitals are employed, as they are in a number of common 
poetic forms. Sections of the text may be energized by capitals as well. 
All of this seems inconsistent, aggravated by no common rule for quotation 
marks (single or double).

If the text is generated with the Google wsdl etc., I'll usually remove 
numbers in order to create an effect of 'orality' to the finished result. 
I'll check for upper ascii characters with the more command, take them out 
with the 'strings' command. I may eliminate punctuation, etc.; for all of 
this, I use 'sed' in various forms as well as 'tr.' At times I may begin a 
text by culling from the internet text as a whole; the command I generally 
use is 'grep -h X *.txt' which produces a file without giving the file 
source of the individual lines. Most of the time, if I'm modifying a text 
in this way, I'll use various perl programs, scripts, etc. in combination, 
working to 'shape' the text to my satisfaction.

I'm not interested in writing a generated text that appears meaningless; 
I'll shape it until it 'tends towards' I want, or the meaning I might find 
hidden within it. This is of course a dialectical process and aesthetic 
choice; for me the justification of a text lies, not in the conceptual 
apparatus that produced it, but in the complex resonances between the text 
and its reading, and the confluent generatings of meaning that occur in 
the process.

Periodically, collections like 'pr.txt' are uploaded to my webpage, which 
is of course nothing more than a directory; one can read the most recent 
collection, complete or incomplete, in conjunction with the image, sound, 
or video files that are referenced within it. The collection is also a 
guide to them. After a while, these files may be removed to make room for 
others; there are, however, 'core' files which remain in place because 
they seem to me to have particular significance over a longer period of 
time. Sometimes a reader will write to me, asking for a file that has been 
taken down; I generally put it back up for one or two days, then take it 
down again.

This is the process that's carried out, day in and day out. (I think I 
once went for 6 days without producing anything - in 15 years.)  suffer 
from depression, poor eyesight getting poorer, minor 'twitches' in my left 
frontal lobe, and severe insomnia; it's the last that governs when I write 
and perhaps how I go about it. I write at all hours of the day or night; I 
need to have a complete and final thought that could always be a conclu- 
sion if I should happen to die at the time; death in fact haunts the text 
at one end, and sex on the other, with the struggling of the inscribed 
body in their midst. I want every text to resonate with every other, every 
text to carry a totality whispered among all of them. If I don't achieve 
this, what I produce feels more like an 'instance' or 'advertisement,' 
something on a path which is yet incomplete - and my nightmares turn 
furious...
