the word shudders from the body of the uniformed man, and some might say
it's a uniformed word, but i jennifer say no, it's a body word full of
spit and sweat and moisture from the lungs barked into the air;

it's tongue and langue and lung simultaneously, clothed in the body of 
the swell-dressed man in a uniform of black and red for anarchy and com-
munism or blue and black for skies and soils of the motherland;

it's languor and lunges and a tong altogether, dynasties of tongs and im-
plements just as the uniform is carapace not character / armor, but true
and real revelation in the blacks and whites of the fatherland;

and it's line and length and tinged altogether, tainted with scents and
odors of the true-real body supporting it above and atmospheric, against
blood-red plant-green, the khaki family desert fairy-tale untrue;

and that is the tail of the bodily word, i jennifer always do say.
