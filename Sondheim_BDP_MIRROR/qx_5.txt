Hi - Has anyone had experience with this HP? I'm thinking of buying a used 
one for $800; it comes with DVD etc.

Also, do you know if it's possible to install linux on this?

Thanks for any advice -

I recently received an Axil 245 with Solaris 7 on it. The computer didn't 
come with a monitor (I checked it out on one, however), and has a 13W3 
connector on the back.

Has anyone had experience writing this (or a related) machine to a PC 
monitor? Does the conversion work? Can anyone advise me on where to by the 
connectors?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Anyone know about a Cortley Guitar from the 1960s or 70s? Nylon acoustic, 
spruce top, seems fairly good - trying to find out some history/details. 
The label says distributed by Maxwell Mayers in Texas and Soutland Musical 
Merchandise Corp. in North Carolina.

Thanks, Alan

User-Agent: tin/1.4.5-20010409 ("One More Nightmare") (UNIX) (NetBSD/1.5.1 
(i386))

I'm trying to install SuSE 7.2 (through Yast2) on a Dell laptop - Inspiron
8000 - and I'm having no luck setting the monitor screen for XWindow or
any graphics at all - has anyone solved this problem? The partitions are
fine, and I can run in minimal command-line mode, but nothing else. I've
tried the LED and other generic monitor configurations and I get garbage,
if anything.

The screen is either TFT or active matrix; the display is 1400x1050x60Hz, 
NVIDIA GeForce2Go (Dell Mobile)

Any help here would be greatly appreciated -

First Day Results from Columbia Mocap

http://www.alansondheim.org/output.mp4
http://www.alansondheim.org/Rolling.mp4
http://www.alansondheim.org/edge_hammer.mp4

Columbia College, Chicago, motion capture studio
Rendered with Motion Builder from Cortex

Performers: Andrew Forster, Steven Crump
Tech and indispensable aid, Jeff Meyers, Brian Wright
Catalyst and indispensable aid, Patrick Lichty

output: social and dispersed avatar, walking in and out of step
Rolling: social and dispersed avatar, simultaneously turning on
axis (standing) and rolling on floor (lying)

both files composed of left-side right-side nodes divided among
two performers 'operating' a single avatar in production and
post-production.

edge_hammer: one performer with 'hammer' proper tending towards
the edge of the performance space; subsequently the hammer
replaces a leg and/or parts of the avatar begin to flicker or
disappear.


Further Developments with Distributed Avatar 

- preparation for a talk at Columbia College tommorrow night (Wed 16):

second day - single avatar distributed among four dancers with specific 
roles assigned:

the same, embedded in Second Life with two different avatars; the third 
section uses behavior collision to combine earlier mocap work from West 
Virginia with current Columbia College mocap

notes from the accompanying talk

My avatar behavior is governed by animation files originating with mocap 
equipment. Almost all professional current mocap uses nodes - information 
coming in from specific body areas, assigned body areas, and so forth. I 
remap the mocap body, by distributing nodes among several human bodies; by 
collapsing nodes, by node reassignment on a geometric or random basis, by 
'heaping' nodes and so forth.

I see 'the body' as:

a. An already inscribed, already virtual body.

b. A distributed or social body: Who speaks 'within' 'us' and who answers 
for us, etc. My avatars are social, their movements produced by groups 
instead of individuals: up to four performers for one animation file, one 
animation file expanded into multiple conforming avatars.

c. A dying body: Our bodies are always on the way out and our work, if it 
doesn't revolve around love, sexual arousal, and hatred, is bounded by, 
revolves within, the horizon of death and despair.

d. An absent body (Drew Leder); we rarely track everything. It is the 
privilege of the camera in Second Life to reveal the avatar as simultan- 
eous object and subject, confined and open, teetering.

e. A present body and an abject body - in and out of virtual worlds.

(political bodies, in the face of mass extinctions, social degradation)

I'm interested in errors, leaks, and resistance, and in the recuperation/ 
re-presentation of flesh. My work always begins and ends with the flesh, 
with the flesh-mind, with embodied mind. (Among other tools, exploring the 
limits of mocap.)

NEW WORK 3RD DAY:
1 RANDOM NODE ASSIGNMENT AMONG 2-3 DANCERS (FAILED, MAPPING IMPOSSIBLE)
2 TELEOLOGICAL BEHAVIOR: DANCERS 'TAKING' AVATAR THRU SPECIFIC TASKS
3 FLIGHT AVATAR W/ VIDEO CAMERA
4 FLIGHT AVATAR: TORSION IN RELATION TO GROUND AVATAR
5 FLIGHT AVATAR: LEG/ARM REASSIGNMENT WITH TWIST

Thanks to: Patrick, Andrew, Steven, Morgan, Myah, Lianne, Katie, Deborah, 
Jeff, Brian, Terence.

Final result: 90 bvh, 50 approx. .avi rendered, 300 stills, 2 hrs. video 
(including flight video).

Thanks to everyone: Claudia Hart, Mark Jeffery, Judd Morrissey, Trevor
Martin, and Patrick Lichty.

New mocap files from Columbia session, with active textures, various
object placements, physical objects going off-world, and so forth.

This is one of the best recordings we've made. There was a fairly
good-sized audience in the room at SAIC, and great discussion.
