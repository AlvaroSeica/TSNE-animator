	You're out there, I know you're out there!
	Come in, come in from the cold!
	Write me, I know you're out there.
	Contact me; I've been waiting for you.
	If you don't write, then there's no there.
	If you write you draw me towards you.
	If you write you bring me in from the cold.
	I exist because you're out there.
	I exist to be drawn in.
	Write me, I know you're out there!
