Scent of No One, Scent of Jennifer


I wake, my breasts bruised, black-blue marks around the nipples. I dream,
wake, there are bite marks on my neck, my legs, my throat. I turn, dream,
wake, there are black hairs on my skin, marking sign and time. I shudder,
turn, dream, wake, there is lipstick on my face, my cock, my legs. I shud-
der, turn, dream, wake, arise, there are cigarette stubs in the sink, wan
smell of liquor in the air. I shudder, turn, dream, wake, arise, mastur-
bate, I feel spent beforehand, nothing emerges: It is as if I wake, my
breasts bruised, black-blue marks around the nipples. It is as if I dream,
wake, there are bite marks on my neck, my legs, my throat. It is as if I
turn, dream, wake, there are black hairs on my skin, marking sign and
time. It is as if I shudder, turn, dream, wake, there is lipstick on my
face, my cock, my legs. It is as if I shudder, turn, dream, wake, arise,
there are cigarette stubs in the sink, wan smell of liquor in the air. It
is as if I shudder, turn, dream, wake, arise, masturbate, feeling spent
beforehand
