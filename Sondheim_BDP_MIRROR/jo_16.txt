Phantom Limb


Phantom limb to limb, sealed mouths, this moment a space appears, opens;
nothing is gone wrong in my life, no violent radiations; the weather is
holding - I can go outdoors and in at will; my body continues on an auto-
nomic level. So that there is a gap, not wound, but a space among flesh,
skin, limbs, not within, a space of writing, inscribing - clearly class-
ical space _here_ placing itself on both sides of the _not_ or requiring a
sense of the other/neither. 

Likewise the machinery itself is functioning, the micromolecular churning
of the symbolic below, the mind above, and the interface appears clear in
this computer laboratory, well-illuminated, easy to gauge, set for yellow
on black, a wide range of colors in fact, differentiations all the way
around. 

For consider any single letter slightly blurred upon the screen or retina,
and why make distinction? Deeper within the symbolic, the differences are
absolute; this isn't 26-gender, but division, communication. What I write
is what you read, so perfectly done, in this classical space of 1997, open
so purely brilliant, a glance holding its own, amanuensis.

And how could communication possibly be distorted, when word after word
appears in certain clarity, the difference among them annotated by spaces
or gaps - even clearly aural spacings? The word is a world is a word, and
no privilege to one or the other!

I would say this is the classic space of the nation-state, when the smil-
ing immigration man says that everything's in order!
