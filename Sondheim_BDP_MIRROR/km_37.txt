She, Committed


What if "Jennifer" were committed by the State of New York, to an Asylum
for the Criminally Insane, in perpetuity, subject to shock treatments,
without reason or recompense, according to the State of New York? Then I,
Alan, would also be subject to an Asylum for the Criminally Insane, her
texts used against me; my body would become the Body of the State, and I
too would be subject to shock treatments and forcible ingestion of drugs -
whatever the Community would mete out. Thus the _continuity_ would be lost
as short-term memory would disappear, long-term become muddied, and a
neutral expression, haunted by memories of haunting, would be _plastered_
on my face (complete with stubble, and a ruly disposition). Of course
"Jennifer" would die, not even given the grace to depart, as Nikuko and
Julu have; _the continuity girl_ would roam like Medea through a violated
world, and the world would continue its uncertainties, topplings, and
instabilities. Already _the continuity girl_ is overworked, and Jennifer
carries that haunted expression herself, wary of everyone as the State
continues its crackdown in the face of a cracking universe. As I wrote
once, annihilation to the limit, and we will always be nearly there from
now on; I hope only to spend my time bereft of institutions, able to find
work to keep my head on straight, supporting a family of brilliant and
literary avatars.
