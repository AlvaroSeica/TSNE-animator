1397 - the beginning of writing





we are writing streams and we are streaming and no streams





we are of the written and we are of the no no written





for they will be alive, and they will be alive, and there will be neither

imminence nor writing in that space, there will be no no wander and no no

unwriting and no no unjulu and no no julu, there will be no no nikuko and

no no unnikuko and there will be no and 





there i will live and write you, nikuko, there i will live and write you,

julu, there is pain in the spaces about me, clean me from capital, i will

not cry in the spaces about me, i will not cry for the small and ruined

things, there will be no no unsmall unruined things





i dream of a space unbound by capital, there i will place julu and nikuko,

a space with boundaries weakened and blurred, a vulnerable and haunted

space, a clearing unbound by incision and grid





and no julu and no no julu

and no unjulu and no no unjulu

and no no unjulu and no unjulu

and no nikuko and no no nikuko

and no unnikuko and no no unnikuko

and no no unnikuko and no unnikuko
