MIRROR/VITRINE





I'm still in the midst of *Baphomet,* but have a reference for you of 

interest - Nicole Oresme's  _Tractatus de configurationibus qualitatum et 

motuum,_ translated in *Nicole Oresme and the Medieval Geometry of 

Qualities and Motions* by Marshall Clagett, U. Wisconsin, 1968. This was 

written in the mid-14th century and surely was a source for Klossowski.

In particular, I.xxxiii and I.xxxiv -  here is a sampling: 



"These things are said to be perceived by a soul throgh a vision, which 

are foreseen in dreams or in an ecstasy or excess of the mind, in 

accordance with the many modes designated by theologians and 

philosophers. [...]  Therefore, just as not all bodies are naturally 

suitable to be mirrors and reflect rays in an ordered way [...] so a soul 

that is unpolished and rough with the difformity of thoughts is not 

disposed to be a mirror in which the future or other hidden things 

discernible by visions shine forth." "Just as in the case of inanimate 

mirrors, some of which are pure and clean without a spot while others are 

contaminated or infected andunable to represent anything [faithfully] 

until wiped off and cleaned, so there are some souls which although 

disposed by birth to visions yet if they contract the blemish of certain 

passions or faults are unable to foresee anything well unless they have 

been purified before and every uncleanliness has been wiped away." 



Also: "And just as a spotless and clean mirror that is looked upon by a 

menstruating woman immediately becomes infected by a certain unsightly 

cloudiness (and if it is new it can never, or scarcely ever, be made 

clear again), so one must seriously warn a young man having a pure mind 

against his noble mind being possessed and indelibly polluted by the 

sight of an unchaste woman, and by this being rendered unsuitable for 

visions of this kind and other studious undertakings." All of this in

a treatise dealing, at this point, with optics! The reference to 

menstruation and the mirror apparently originates with Aristotle, among 

others. Combining Lacan's mirror stage, Kristeva's clean and proper body, 

one ends I think with the abjection of the phallic - the _blemish_ which 

again I'd relate to the _hole,_ as in my other texts - as well as 

rendering something useless/exhausted. And what is rendered 

useless/exhausted is male narcissism itself, which collapses, confused, 

beneath the _stigmata_ of the menstrual.



The _smoothed_ surface of the mirror - here I go again - is _pleasure_ 

itself, or its fetishization; the mirror, like _nature,_ reflects the 

order of the world, _is_ of the order. The woman muddies the waters, 

roughens them; menses are turbulent, contaminating, and the divinatio is 

broken, fetishization collapsed. With the mirror rendered useless, it 

becomes nothing but a _thing_ in the world, another object; expecting to 

see himself (_hear his/the name_), our knight-in-arms is suddenly cast 

into an alienating environment where death speaks louder than anything 

else (the woman bleeds but does not cry; the man who bleeds will quickly 

die). 



You had said that the breaths in *Baphomet* were reminiscent of the 

abject; to me, they are reminiscent of what we are given/construct of 

ourselves and each other on the Net. Dematerialized, it is interesting to 

speculate on the potential (intensification) of an _ecriture feminin_ to 

disrupt the proceeds, return the body itself - and would this mean the 

shutdown of the computer terminal, the screen going dark, going _glass,_

momentarily -



And still hardly, if ever, reflecting anything at all...
