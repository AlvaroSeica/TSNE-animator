... "I had forgotten, almost, how thrilling fountains can be. An amazing
spectacle. Earlier today, my family went to the Rio to see a traveling art
exhibit called the treasures of Russia. In the exhibition, there were some
watercolors of the fountains at the Palaces at Peterhof, and they took my
breath away. Alright, alright, perhaps that was a bit cliche, but they
were captivating. It made me think of my visit to Versailles, the exhibi-
tion, that is. Speaking of France, my window also looks out upon the as-
of-yet uncompleted Paris Hotel. I am staring at a half-finished Eiffel To-
wer and a pint-sized Arc de Triumphe and it is very amusing. I would that
that everyone would love Vegas just for its sense of humor. And right now
I am looking at the boulevard before the hotel which is lined with lighted
trees whose rustling leaves make the white lights twinkle and a skyline
that is all purple and teal, and I am completely charmed and I just wanted
to share that with you. I could have written you about how I started to
doubt my own reality Tuesday night, but writing about warm winter nights
is so much nicer now. I love you,

Jennifer"
