"there is fog in the space and there is fog in my heart
there is rain in the air and there is rain in my heart
my heart, my heart
there is dew on the ground, and there is dew in my eyes
there is frost on the ground, and there is frost in my eyes
my eyes, my eyes
there is a rainbow so high, my soul is a rainbow
my soul is a rainbow, my soul is so high
my soul, my soul
i would give you, my love, my world of fine weather
i would give you, my love, my world of dark storms
i would give you, my love, my world of fog and rainbows
all of my worlds, all of my worlds
i would give you, my love
i would give you, my love

come to my village and dance with me, woman
come to my bed, and i will dance with you, man
come to my heart, and i will love you, woman
i will love you man, when i come to your heart

there is fog on the ground and snow in the air
there is rain in the sky and frost on the ground
there is sun on the ground and dew in the air
i give you my weather
i give you my weather

weather of peace and weather of wartime
weather of silence and weather of sound
rainbow of weather and weather of thunder
weather of lightning, come to my bed

come to my bed, my love, and i will dance with you, woman
i will come to your bed, my love, and dance with you, man
you will be my woman, i will be your man
you will be my man, i will be your woman

there is fog in the space and there is fog in my heart
there is rain in the air and there is rain in my heart
my heart, my heart

there is fog in the space and there is fog in my heart
there is rain in the air and there is rain in my heart
my heart, my heart

there is fog in the space and there is fog in my heart
there is rain in the air and there is rain in my heart
my heart, my heart

there is fog in the space and there is fog in my heart
there is rain in the air and there is rain in my heart
my heart, my heart

there is fog in the space and there is fog in my heart
there is rain in the air and there is rain in my heart
my heart, my heart

there is fog in the space and there is fog in my heart
there is rain in the air and there is rain in my heart
my heart, my heart

there is fog in the space and there is fog in my heart
there is rain in the air and there is rain in my heart
my heart, my heart"
