i don't want to be the bearer of bad news along the Moselle,
nor nullo spinae, nothing of the bones of men, Ausonius, i've
had enough barbarians pressed hard against the gate -

Lesbia stood by the bronze auracular
you could read her future if you knew the future
her hands fluttered in sacred cords
Luna Celesta, heard murmurs in the distance
it is love and sex, it is death and hard marl
the grain of the metal of the blade of the sword
behind the auracular, shapes of dragons, pearls
they're here in the world
they're unfurled
the edges of the auracular curled
turbulence, the violence of the pair
there was hardly anyone there
Lesbia and Veneres Cupidinesque were bare
the stones of the auracular murmuring and austere
humans behind the stones of the auracular
i don't want to be the bearer of bad news beyond Moselle
Veneres Cupidinesque was behind her
Veneres Cupidinesque's hands made flame-cast shadows
you could read her future if you knew the future
her hands fluttered in sacred cords
Luna Celesta, heard murmurs in the distance
it was a soft summer evening, roma, 324
it is love and sex, it is death and hard marl
the grain of the metal of the blade of the sword
the humans preparing the final act
behind the auracular, shapes of dragons, pearls
they're here in the world
they're unfurled
the edges of the auracular curled
turbulence, the violence of the pair
there was hardly anyone there
the stones of the auracular murmuring and austere
humans behind the stones of the auracular
nor nothing of men's bones, Ausonius
Veneres Cupidinesque's hands made flame-cast shadows
you could read her future if you knew the future
her hands fluttered in sacred cords
Luna Celesta, heard murmurs in the distance
it was a soft summer evening, roma, 324
it is love and sex, it is death and hard marl
the grain of the metal of the blade of the sword
they're here in the world
they're unfurled
the edges of the auracular curled
there was hardly anyone there
Lesbia and Veneres Cupidinesque were bare
the stones of the auracular murmuring and austere
humans behind the stones of the auracular
i've had enough, the hordes against the gate
Lesbia, she said, Veneres Cupidinesque
