Footnotes:



[1] The dream screen is the (abject and maternal) matrix of the dream.

Think of a dream as a projection which simultaneously hides (screens

_from_ the unconscious) and reveals (illuminates its ostensible con-

tents. The symbolic is the order of substitution, concatenation, and

language; the imaginary refers to disruption, laterality, and the 

pre-symbolic. Anika Lemaire, in *Jacques Lacan*: "The imaginary is an

infinitely supple conceptual category. It covers everything in the

phantasy which is an image or representation of a lived experience 

pertaining to the castration complex before its formalization - for-

ever incomplete, of course - becomes petrified in the symbol of the 

'Phallus.'" "...the imaginary ocncerns the intuitive lived experience

of the body (dependence, welcome, gift, etc.), of activity, passivity,

of the will to power, etc." ... Thus the imaginary is a _prior_. In

telecommunications, however, the reverse is true: ASCII text is always

already symbolic, a linguistic formation, through which the imaginary

"leaks." [11]



[2] The web inversion is the inverted body sustained across the mem-

brane of the Internet; it is also the (partial) externalization and

dissolution of the ego as a result of inversion.



[3] The Name is the proper name, uncannily tied (through an imaginary,

not symbolic connection, a tie of intimacy or ravelling) to the body;

it is _your_ name I dream of, delicious shuddering at the slow and

liquid evocation of syllables...



[4] Protocol specifies specific commands, codes, rates, and linkages

among machines - what's acceptable and what's not. It also stands-in

for the etiquette of the (human) subject, who "behaves" in company,

gaining recognition. Address is the proper name and its directory

path; recognition is simultaneously the permission to speak and an

acceptance of the "fullness" of the subject, his or her imaginary.

The subject exists as a tentative _coagulation_ within recognition,

producing a continuous REWRITE or use of the "shifter" within protocol

to reaffirm its existence as a (speaking, acting) coherency.



[5] The subject is inscribed _within_ the communicative order on the 

Net; an inscription is a demarcation based on complementarity in 

classical logic (the intersection of books and non-books being the 

null-set). This logic is two-valued (0/1, true/false) and distrib-

utive: any two members of a set "define" only the space between them.

In gestural logic, distributivity is eliminated, and two elements can

"define" the entire bandwidth or universe of discourse - the elements

formally extend beyond themselves, and their boundaries are fuzzy.

The sememe is a partially-closed or inscribed web of signifiers and

signifieds; it is _active_ and turbulent (as in the theory sememe for

example).



[6] Why would the subject collapse? Exhaustion, sensory or information

overload; the increasingly neurotic _frisson_ of desire in Net commun-

ication; insomnia; the radical disjunction of "real life / face-to-

face" and virtual subjectivity; dreams, sweats, obsessive masturbation

- the general failure of inscription and rewrite; lose of the I and 

eye; sightless and siteless.



[7] "Aphanisis" is from Ernest Jones and is used here to refer to a 

hollowing or devouring of desire, the interpenetration of anomie and

libido.



[8] I flame you on the net; you return the favor. I flame you again,

raising the stakes; the language, veering back and forth between us,

shrieks with incantations. Detumescence sets in; I hardly remember

your name, everything lost, useless between us.



[9] Dreams collapse; as in masturbation, images rush and violate,

disappear into the darkness. It is the _foolishness_ of Net communi-

cation, hardly recognized, always present; caught with our pants

down before the moment of castration or clitorectomy, _done things_

of the inertia of the world. As if a password opened a gateway on to

emptiness or the _null address_: nothing doing here where everything

ends up. (_Not_ to imply a narrative: Everything begins and ends here

and all at once.)



[10] We always already speak to the REWRITE which is the only speech

and speech's matrix or dream screen; REWRITE recursions into REWRITE

as speech is _other_. And what does one make of this, from Sartre's

*Critique of Dialectical Reason*: "The reactive behaviour occasioned

in the listeners by the Other-Thought as the meaning of the Other-

Voice is always the _behaviour of alterity_"?



[11] In this manner, the other of the footnotes continues indefin-

itely, the production of a linguistic chain, everything necessary to

modify the original essay in the form of an integration or _smoothing_

- as if desire had contracted into the semblance of an _accent_ or

diacritical mark.
