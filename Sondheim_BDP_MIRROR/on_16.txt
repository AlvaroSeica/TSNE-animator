most likely the end of the poser breakdown programs
i don't want to do any more of these
i don't want any more sexual backgrounds
there's something better on the way
 but last night i had another panic attack
i thought i was dying
i thought it was all over for me
it felt like a heart attack
what i imagine a heart attack feels like
the tingling, everything, every little symptom
i lay in bed and trembled
stress was killing me and i worried about azure
i don't want to do any more of these
there's something better on the way


Annoying


Quite a while ago, I sent out an 'annoying egrets' video - egrets stirring 
up the bottom muck in a wetlands, with their feet and wing-beating. Here 
is some similar Canada goose behavior, with a body-rocking motion. 
Annoyance seems to be a close tethering between hunter and prey, within or 
across species, light or heavy. It involves an unexpected disruption of 
every-day routines on an insistent basis that demands attention; the 
attention is often an irritant on the part of the prey, whose habitus is 
broken. While annoyance may be novel or protean, it may gain ground with 
repetition, resulting in an action of some sort on the part of the prey, 
simply to discontinue the stimulus.

Annoyance corrupts routine; it is Serres' parasite gnawing away at the 
etiquette of life. It may be creative or deadly, or both; at the heart of 
creation, one finds violence. Ultimately, promulgation of the species or 
individual is impetus, to the benefit of the neuro-physical and physical 
life of the hunter. However, annoyance is always a dangerous game; it is a 
wager that nothing worse will occur, that the hunter will survive. It 
defines the edge or lip of the real; beyond annoyance is love on one hand, 
but wanton destruction on the other.

existence, future victim of stroke


the truth slumbers, it murmurs, mumbles, inconceivably thinned. within the 
fissure, neural cleft, error in brain anatomy, this text resides, 
information episteme. if i cannot speak, if i will have not been able to 
speak, then the material, materia dejecta, remains, i will sink into the 
real, with no report, no sagacity, no cause, other than, no cause. 
sinking, i will be _there,_ unable to tell, that which i do not know, 
which i will have no longer known, void, stroke, other.

:lost body-skins resonate among internals and externals, out- and in- 
gassing, our wonder is in the face of alterity, our dissolution, 
nonetheless an obdurate. it is the capsule or pill of the real, one drug 
as fine as any Other, melding through recession, midst of inflationary 
universe and absolute disconnect. in this home of the malady, i reside, 
able on to speak the truth.

:i consider a stroke which will forthcome, transmitting the gap between 
zero and one, that of being which recedes simultaneously always already in 
residence, consider _that_ residence, on the order of a matheme, Badiou. i 
consider a stroke as neural fissure and deprivation, i will have no longer 
remembered, that of the sheffer stroke, unrememberance of simultaneity, do 
the logic.
