UNABLE TO DELIVER





If the indexical is a double articulation between two planes each

associated with difference, in which the index itself is an embodi-

ment within the symbolic, then cyberspace communication may be

considered indexical - to the extent that subjectivity or embodi-

ment is read through ASCII, not opening into the world but back

into a presence or uncanny phantom, haunting as one might say, the

shamanic familiar - that which we are given, in fact, a circum-

scription of the text or reinscription, not of the novel which

leaves us satisfied but of that excess or curlicue which _demands_

and produces the real or irreal, emptied of itself - so that it

emerges swollen, tumescent, through the writing of it or against

it or not at all, as if excess were not of desire but, say, solely

in relation to data, to the data-bank - the frisson of it implying

otherwise - these are difficult times we live in - these produce

nothing but themselves - we are witnesses to that - we are the

presence of this difference which refuses entry, producing enchant-

ment evident in the smallest scrap of writing, the smallest sig. 

for example, the least line indicative of, as I have said, this

uncanny presence which expands as the source grows shorter, which

is never fulfilled by the text, so that the text is always a gap

with itself, insistent upon what it cannot deliver, except for the

opening and entrance of cyberspace, the writing, as I said, in 

hysteria: IN HYSTERIA IN ABSENTIA for hysteria is the absent symp-

tom defining the body and here in cyberspace, the absent symptom

is clearly all the body there is - and as you may surmise, I am now

sick, physically, my heart-rate speeded up, sweating, shivering as

if in the grips of walking pneumonia or other fever when, in fact,

my body temperature is somewhat below normal, pains occupying most

of me, an odor of sorts, constant headaches and preliminary eye

stress portending the onset of migraine, thoughts of abandonment,

discard, as if I had nothing to say any longer, so I would speak 

unto you the length of a breath, turned in upon itself, beginning

with itself, insistent upon what it cannot deliver, except for the

opening and entrance of cyberspace, the presence of this difference

which refuses entry, producing enchantment, the double articulation

between two planes, insistent upon what it cannot deliver.
