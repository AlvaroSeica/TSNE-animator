Cuts and Trebles (disappearance of the sign in community)

Cutting up a strathspey, help me dear God here, the bow flies and doubles
triples, the whole thing thrimbles, tumbles along. Tremble the rhythms,
thrum faster until hearts ache, beats break. Sooner the tune shimmers,
lost is the sign that signals. Submerge thimble and triple, limber tones
and listen, tossed is the line that ravels. Sound is the sender of trills
or trifles, cutting the wobble of timbrelling times. Lost is the sign in
the body of cutting, strathspey the meld of the bodily tossed, rhyme the
last moment of cluttering thought. So the sign's gone the line, so the
earth's given birth, so the air's played down there, so the winter sin-
ters. I talk to you, the words are birds, thrimble and tremble, the lines
of the body gone in the air there, winter sintered, summer hummered, fall
down, spring forth to the earth given birth. Sputtering the strathspey,
struttering the hornpipe, double-up bow and slur, double-up bow and slur.
Crushed-bowstroke signifier of Ashley and Scotty, slithering, slathering,
signified spread, gone to the head, ghost of the signified, gone to the
ground.
