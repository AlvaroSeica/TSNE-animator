Getting Around -


Has anyone written on the phenomenology of the Mac in relation to the PC
(DOS) or Linux/Unix. When I'm in DOS or the last, I'm constantly aware of
expanding neighborhoods, constituted by the current file, the local
directory, and the rest of the tree structure (often appearing broken,
interrupts at the level of directory/subdirectory). On the Mac, files
appear dispersed, sprayed across folders which are only partly hierarch-
ical in appearance; everything may exist within the hard-drive, but the
_ordering_ of the drive appears to be that of relatively independent
modules.

So on Mac, I'm more aware of _application-neighborhood_ or foreclosing
than I am on the other OS's (including WinX) - but less aware of the
topography of the machine in its entirety. And, having come from PC/Unix
structures, I find this oddly disconcerting - I can't _range_ the dir-
ectory structure at will. Not even the various finder apps correct this;
they bring to the surface (and as Turkle points out, the Mac is a con-
fluence of surfaces) files that appear to come from nowhere...

As Turkle probably pointed out, the tree structure creates a modernist
grid across the machinery; the Mac appears as a confluence of territorial
intensifications...
