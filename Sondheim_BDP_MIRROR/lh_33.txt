Parable


This occurred near Ise, precisely during the rebuilding of the shrine.
Nikuko and Izanagi were walking as usual. They approached an old man with
a huge and comical hat, wide-brimmed, of a peculiar shape. Now what, said
Izanagi, smiling. Nikuko noted that the brim was very wide indeed, and the
flap on the left held the Minister of the Right, while the flap on the
right seemed to contain the Minister of the Left. Poor and deluded, said
Izanagi. The old man looked up, and tilted his head slightly to the left.
Whole trees fell down on the slopes and the ground rumbled beneath them.
Then he looked at Izanagi, and tilted his head to the right. The mountain
roared and great boulders crashed on the path all around them. Without
saying a word, the old man slowly continued on his way. This time, it was
Nikuko who was laughing, staring at the hat disappearing in the distance.
He's on the brim, she laughed, he's on the brim.
