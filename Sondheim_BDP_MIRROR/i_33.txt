In other words - not only does the concept of mental illness change in

time, but the prevalent illnesses also undergo transformation. Do these

reflect a continually transforming psychic core - in which case, what is

the basis of such transformations; how are interior and exterior admixed

- or do they in fact contain representations of an psychic core that is

itself only existing as such representations? If schizophrenia is a 

splitting of "a" self, and hysteria an inscribing of "a" body, are self

and body other than representations through the schizophrenic and hys-

teric? And finally, if we are now concerned with illnesses of representa-

tion (and affect, disassociation), what is the core of the inscription at

work here? I would argue that it is a form of _technique,_ that technique

exists among self and body, that all three are continually inscribed and

reinscribed, and that accumulation characterizes their interaction - an

accumulation splitting them apart into images of health and illness, vis-

a-vis the psychoanalytical profession and power in the Foucauldian sense.
