GRISTLE





(Re: The recent error message explosion on Fiction-of-Philosophy._





Gristle is the _stuff_ of the Net, the assertion of the inert vomiting

back the spew as in Sartre, the obdurancy of it, an existence trans-

versing communication itself, refusing communication...



What's given is the absence of control, so the flood/spew occurs on

another lower level (what we take for granted is high-level languaging).



One level drops through another. That's what happened when the list

overflows with exponentially-increasing error messages. The _stuff_ 

appears, the nauseous. Working on correcting the situation, I literally

vomited, repeatedly, over the toilet, one or another spew, emission.

What ordinarily remains hidden, completes digestion. The Net surfaces,

always surfaces. This wasn't surface; this was the gristle.



The gristle, by virtue of the fact that error is _any_ content, is 

always already abject. Nothing can get to it. It ignores meaning, which

is a higher-level construct. Or it constructs any meaning at all, which

is the destruction of meaning. When gristle falls apart, the meat of

the surface is revealed.



One always learns from error; it's only error that opens the wound 

that's always present, sutured, _civilized._ Embarrassment, error, 

shame, expose the interiority of the machinics of cultural confluence,

communality, the apparently flawless realm of the signifier. Clearing

out the _stuff_ of files thickened with repeated error messages, the

inertia of the Net appears. This is _it._ Nothing is even said, sayable

when _everything_ is said, exponentially and in quantity...



_The bones showed through. Gristle. I vomited them up._
