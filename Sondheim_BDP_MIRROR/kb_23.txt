minus america (a traditional poem)


it's the middle of the night and there are columns crashing down
everywhere to the left and right of me, and i am traveling
one hundred miles an hour across the thin white line of oklahoma,
lights slamming from the distance, promise of nothing, annihilation
passing me by,
it's the middle of the night in oklahoma, there's a truck burning
on the side of the road and tom and roger and me put it out and
there's a car burning in a gas station and we take off high speed
tailing across new mexico until the transmission breaks free
of the load of anguish and too much talk, codeine and too much drink,
roiling across the road, we pull in, and it's the middle of the night
in new mexico,
back then with perfect hate music from the radio in carolina,
back then one hundred miles an hour in oklahoma, line bisecting
horizon after horizon, small-town lights churning past in summer heat,
bisecting my eye, cutting it open, two blind halves falling
to the floor
of the car of the highway of codeine of too much drink,
of transmission, there's always another thin white line,
i think it's trying to say something, flat like a road or a bridge,
flat like a playing field or roadkill with its singular eye -
i think too, this is america, this _dash_ in space, this emptiness
in the middle of columns falling down as i think tom and sung-ja
stuck with me somewhere in indiana or stuck with me against the roof
in flight from chicago heading nowhere, this great _minus_
of white light, this vector or crease in firmament, this tale
left without an ending, this moment when we know it all, owe it all,
this energy emptied of all thought at one hundred miles an hour,
repeating itself over and over again, i try to sleep, tom, sung-ja,
towns crowding themselves towards the entrance of the millennium,
this dash in space, this zero, this america
