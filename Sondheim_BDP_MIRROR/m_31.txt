"A concept must of course eventually be put into verbal form if the aim is
to communicate the idea to others; but for private thought it is not nece-
ssary to wait for this stage. Indeed, for some people, including Einstein
and probably also such physicists as Faraday and Rutherford, the most im-
portant part of thinking may occur not with the use of words: 'I have no
doubts but that our thinking goes on for the most part without use of signs
(words) and beyond that to a considerable degree unconsciously'. Such per-
sons tend to think in terms of images to which words may or may not be as-
signable. Einstein tells of his pleasure in discovering, as a boy, his 
skill in contemplating relationships among geometrical 'objects' - triang-
les and other abstract objects of the imagination. He explains more fully
in a letter to Jacques Hadamard:

The psychical entities which seem to serve as elements in thought are cer-
tain signs and more or less clear images which can be 'voluntarily' repro-
duced and combined. ... But taken from a psychological viewpoint, this
combinatory play seems to be the essential feature in productive thought--
before there is any connection with logical construction in words or other
kinds of signs which can be communicated to others. The above-mentioned
elements are, in my case, of visual and some muscular type. Conventional
words or other signs have to be sought for laboriously only in a secondary
stage, when the mentioned associative play is sufficiently established and
can be reproduced at will."
