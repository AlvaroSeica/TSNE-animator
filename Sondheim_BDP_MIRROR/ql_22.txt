10. tied into digital habitus. It is the digital that, beyond tissue, 
sickness, and death, inhabits us; it is the digital, unrecognized and 
seething, that we inhabit. Our production within the cosmos is also our 
distance from it, an inauthentic distance constructed from potential wells 
and the remnants of inscriptive processes designed to ward off just about 
everything: death, dream, menses, semen, feces, wounds and illnesses - 
anything (ignorantly? popularly? mythologically?) smelling of pollution, 
discomfort, breakdown of musical structure. This is of course old news; 
what is different is the substrate, violation or virtual fabric everywhere 
and nowhere at all. What does one do with the neutrino? proton? electron? 
quark? Higgs boson? knowledge of the K-meson? Inscription and naming? The 
habitus is the production of sound - or paint, dance, or body, rite, or 
ritual. If there is deity, it is the digital itself, that division among 
virtual + and - (and the rest of it), everything and nothing at all - 
which is also everything. All this (buzzing) confusion disappears in the 
care and caress of the flesh, tending of an instrument or lover, following 
one following through sound through and beyond conclusion.
