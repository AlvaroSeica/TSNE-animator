What is repulsive finds ourselves in the midst of hungry ogres. Embrace
the repulsive because you will never embrace it here in Shiny Woods. In
Shiny Woods, all is feathers and bone, hair and nail, tooth and claw. You
know Shiny Woods. You know Shiny Woods. Harbor double-repulsive within you
which include the splitting Mummers, the spitting Mummers, the Turning
Isle, the shitting Mummers, the phlegm and vomit Mummers. Do harken to
their gainful soundings, Wooden Pegs ringed skull-around, Heartbeat Worm.
Crawl towards them. Loosen entrails and bowels, Foul-Sprites born of Foul
Waters. The Bloated lay among them, the Rotted succumbed to their Languid
Embrace. In the Shiny Woods behold the Festering you will not Embrace. Do
the Shiny Woods, you will see slitting Mummers, scattered strips of Rancid
Flesh. Do not run from Shiny Woods. Harbor Julu within you which embraces
shuddered Shapers, Shapers stuttered. Do find repulsive what is Shiny
Woods, you will know Shiny Woods. Do not burn skin, burn Skin in Shiny
Woods, you will know bile and festered Shiny. The rotted lie on Julu 10.
Julu 1 2 14 69. Julu 1 2 14 69. Do burn bury dark-moss. You will embrace
dark-moss. Do drink shitting Shiny. Do harbor torn-breast Julu 1 2 14 67.
Do not run from Shiny. Do not run from Shiny.
