I am Alanxy why am I Alanxy
because
that is because when I
send you a message, that is when I because, when I send you a message
it must be control-x then y, that is
control-x to send, then y for yes,
yes yes to send the message to you, yes yes

but Alanxy, yes, well,
then when this happens, the control key is moved,
not where I want it to be!
or no longer operates
or is missing in the first place
or never was there,
then when I type
control-x y
to send you the message yes yes
to send you the message,
then I become Alanxy
then I am Alanxy
after signing Alan,
after signing love, Alan
and you see my Alanxy
sometimes or I return and write back to you as Alan
or as love, Alan
not as love Alan no imperative, not even love Alanxy
or maybe love Alanxy
that is an algebra of existence, is it not
that is an algebra of existence
