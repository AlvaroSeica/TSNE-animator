Cycles, feedback, circulations of the Net: begin with neurophysiological
processes thus _pertaining_ to the biophysical, muscles locating arm,
wrist, hand, fingers, lending themselves to closed-circuit keyboard
interrupts, accumulated signals transported over modem to screen display,
always already shunted returns, signals, time-ins, time-outs, accumula-
tions in file ready for packet encapsulation, each stage fed back within
itself as transport protocol layers distribute, route, reassemble in total
isolation, unknown, unknowing: reverse receptor procedures, what then? the
swollen slow breathing of the Net, day-night cycles, semester rabid break-
downs, posts and responses, chat lines open as fingers double themselves
on ytalk, singularities neat and orderly on MOO, talker, MUD - vast circu-
lations of enunciations, utterances, parole, within biophysical, neuro-
physiological responses and circuitry completing electron sputtering at
both ends: what is to say that there is more than this, an other present
at creation, creation itself? 

A _what_ which speaks, completes, compete, garners circulations, returns 
split, shunted into decentered lamina, the wryting is the _said_ of it.
