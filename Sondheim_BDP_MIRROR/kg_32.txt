Daishin Nikuko meets the Buddha on the road. The Buddha says, kill me.

Daishin Nikuko says, no, I can't kill you. The Buddha says, I'm wounded,

I'm beyond hope, help me. I've seen all that suffering. I haven't really

suffered. Kill me. You'll be enlightened.



Daishin Nikuko says, I don't want to be enlightened. Here, let me help

you. Daishin Nikuko knows about medicine. She's practically the god of

medicine. She has salves and ointments. Daishin Nikuko applies the salves

to the Buddha, applies the ointments to the Buddha. The Buddha's too weak

to fight back, there's no defensive strategy, not even that of being over-

come.



Daishin Nikuko overcomes the Buddha and cures him. The Buddha's been re-

vived by Daishin Nikuko and has enlightenment. He thinks he's been rein-

carnated. (Perhaps he thinks he's been reincarnated as the Buddha.) He has

lost face because of this. He won't tell anyone. I was sick two weeks at

the most, he thinks. No one will know.



Daishin Nikuko continues on her way. (Perhaps, the Buddha thinks, he will

meet her later on the road and kill her. You're nature, I'm culture, she

had said, or so you think. Stop making these divisions and cycles. How do

I do that he had said. Get better, Daishin Nikuko had said. Medicine will

overcome you.)
