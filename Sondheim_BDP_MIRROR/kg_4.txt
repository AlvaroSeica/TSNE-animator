why I don't sign my name
anymore is because maybe it has been stolen
or who can pronounce it  I mean
what's the pronouncement about  because
it sneaks around  to everyone
hello  because someone has used it  why
it can be reused hundreds of times  as if
there's no end to it  no end to this as well
which is why  I don't sign my name anymore
because it's been-stolen-nikuko  or so
she says  just a moment   someone's at
the door again  at least I think I heard
someone knocking  maybe it has to do with
the name thing  what do you think-nikuko
does it have to do with the name thing
