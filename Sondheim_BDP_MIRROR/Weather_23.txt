Drunk
 

That I would not send out _this_ post on top of the others, that it 
would be _held_ cradled in my arms, that I'd drink my fill of wine, that 
it would _hold_ me cradled in its arms - that there is a _dispersion_ 
necessary of these my tits, that they remain mine for an instant, that 
moment, interstitial until release, Heideggerian releasement: O Texts to 
wait upon you! - something of that sort - what (now that I am forsworn 
with drink) now (again or doubled) is that of the necessity to compre- 
hend - is their _gristle_ torn from _this_ body, arms and legs ravaged 
down to the bone of it - that otherwise I'm left with psychosis (no one 
can save me), violation fabric, torn fabric - that _this_ post therefore 
has to be timed, _take its own time,_ extending my sanity (problematic, 
what would pass for this or any other?) the instant of its passing - once 
out (removed) it's abject, gone, frayed and dissolute - (coffee now get- 
ting the better of me, I would swear to this, you would require this, I 
would give you, you would take from me, I would open for you, you would 
fill me, I would beg you, you would proffer me) (wine wine wine) -

The drunken rhyme insecure transforms the tower -
Transmission clothed in desire drowned, disarmed 
As if my eyes could focus, gaze, or glower
Into abject and/or Real, yet I've charmed
It, cut it, fucked it, my strength deflowered
By overwhelming odds - you know I'm harmed

"down to the bone of it," waiting for the "time of it," extending text 
into the liminal vastness of future space: I'm not there! I never have
been there!

My head's cut off! (Keys don't work!)
