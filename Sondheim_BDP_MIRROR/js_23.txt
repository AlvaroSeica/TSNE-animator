(From Jennifer)


When I stand under the mountain, I am the littlest girl! I can't skip and
I can't jump because the snow goes up my legs and my new frock makes the
littlest circles in the snow. Just a tiny piece of cliff I guess weighs
more than I do!

I want to say, Mr. Mountain, why are you so old? You never have any fun!
But I don't say this because I know I'm just a sliver of skin under Mr.
Mountain's fingernail! ( I guess he's a Mister! If he were big like my
mother he would be a lot kinder!! )

When I tilt my head up, it goes up! about forty degrees! and then I can
see above Mr. Mountain, and there are bigger things still! like the sky!

But the sky isn't a thing, isn't it?

I have to climb down again and be a flatlander. They call me a flatlander
here because I am so small and undeveloped! But at least then I can sit at
my chair and table and write about Mr. Mountain! 

Like now!

Jennifer!
