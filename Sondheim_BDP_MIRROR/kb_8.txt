SHIPS FIRST CLASS DESTROYERS, I'd say quite a distance from HIROSHIMA
wide-island, wouldn't you? WHITE RAIN in KITAKYUSHU TONIGHT up THRU
HAGI, Japanese bush clover, wouldn't you say quite a distance, TANBO
walking in the dark? I heard Fukuoka almost got hit. Recently, these
kids got zapped on a TV Pocket Monster cartoon - just when the action
got good, they got flickers on the screen and they got quasi-epileptic
convulsions. You can carry the digital versions around in your pocket
NAGATO. The words hang out; they got what it takes. The photo's eerily
calm, as if the ships were the outgrowths of roots taken in the harbor
floor. Suspended by virtue of mechanical perspective above the rice-
fields. I wasn't able to breathe for the first two years of my life.
The truth is, I'm a victim of permanent suffocation. Why is it always
me, me, me.
