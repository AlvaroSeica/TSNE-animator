Why the Poor Left Will Lose





Every move the left makes is relative; every move the right makes is 

absolute. Every move the left makes acknowledges history; every move the 

right makes replaces it. The right is interstitial and symbolic; the left 

must be continuous and imaginary, requiring more resources than available.



Poverty breeds poverty; ignorance breeds poverty; bad education breeds 

ignorance; only poverty may breed good education but remains powerless, 

relative, dispersed, out of flow and control of the media.



The poor and cultural workers are by and large marginalized; art and the 

avant-garde are filtered into design into the homes of the rich. The rich 

watch the poor; the poor, thinking they understand everything, understand 

nothing. The rich, thinking they understand nothing at all, understand 

everything.



The poor left have _always_ had abortions. The poor left have died from 

them. The poor left have their speech taken away; long live rap.



There is no left; there are lefts. The rich know there are no poor.



The war over women is also the war _against_ women, fought within the 

aegis of poverty as well. No one wants pornography; no one looks at it.



The less-schooled poor are also less accessed to the Net and other more 

advanced communications; changing standards ensures they will remain 

excluded forever, no matter what the rhetoric.



Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose.



WE HAVE MET THE ENEMY AND HE IS US.
