Cancer death and mourning


On March 16, 2000, my mother died of cancer. From September 1999 until 
March 1, 2000, I was virtual writer-in-residence for the trAce, an on- 
line writing community. During this period, up through and after her 
death, I wrote an extended meditation, broken up into smaller texts, on
cancer and death. Some of this was in the diary I kept for trAce. The 
following is a record, begining with dates from my partner's diary.

from Azure Carter's diary:

## On Tuesday, July 6, 1999, we went to the New York Public Library and 
saw Alan's mother & had dinner w/ Tom & Leslie. I think we had lunch at 
the Italian place w/ Evelyn (mother). This must have been the 1st time I 
met her. I arrived on the 26th of June. My aunt came to NY July 1 & left 
the 5th.
## On Thursday, July 8, we went to PA, probably w/ your mother. This was 
probably when they were working on our space. (Workmen had to install a 
new outer wall on the building.)
## On the 9th, we went to the Back Mountain Library Auction.
## On the 14th we took the new computer to Brooklyn.
## On the 28th Wednesday we went back to NY 10 am.
## On Tuesday, August 17, we met Evelyn at 12:30. We probably had lunch at 
the Italian place & maybe frozen yogurt at the health food place.
## I had "surgery" on the 10th Saturday, crossed out.
## On Sept 18th, Evelyn's 80th b-day. We went to PA 1 pm.
## On Sept 21, 3pm bus home.
## On Sept 27, I think we were supposed to hear from Evelyn about her 
tests.

mother's apartment in Manhattan to our apartment in Brooklyn; she was 
retiring and moving back to Pennsylvania.)

Peregino's w/parents.
