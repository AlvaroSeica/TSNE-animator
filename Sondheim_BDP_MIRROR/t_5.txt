tonight i got a call from south central. and what could i make of the soft
voice speaking on the other end of the line and what was the voice saying.
it kept coming in announcing south central and i kept coming out announc-
ing new york and it kept coming in and kept coming and then it said good-
bye the soft soft voice said goodbye

call from a screaming woman coming in down in los angeles and then threat-
ened suicide and then gave a number cut off half-way through i was there
for that one then

screaming woman in the fields outside irvine california running hysteri- 
cally sound stopped we kept cutting through

kept coming on down from syracuse new york and talking i calmed her down 
talked her back into equipoise and life

back into onto the net back in again
