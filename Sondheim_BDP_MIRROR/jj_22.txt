Desire


What's desire got to do with it? Every text becomes a tremendous signpost
like a game of sport. Competition requires duration; it's not enough to
win, but to win over a period of time, to have played the game, extended
the rite. The text begs for duration; letters cry, weep, wail; they are
genuinely in pain, wounded, sutured only by the presence of your silent
voice, as they approach, one after another, just as in the fable. But it's
not enough to read, to say my name, your name; it's not enough to say the
name of another; a reply is in order, just as a prayer is a reply to God,
con- soling her with her existence. A reply is a salve; at least I am
worthy of a response in the midst of your silence, and you have spoken. 

God does not want our thankfulness; God knows. God wants her loneliness to
end, if only for a second, an aeon, in this universe of histories and
plasma. God can do nothing for you; no one can, as the world churns in
every way. What you can do for God is comfort her, and it is as the com-
forting of a child; it is a kindness and a space of giving, a caring from
one to another. Let us love the solitude and solicitude of speech and of
speech's writing; let us love the gift of comforting, the peopling of
God's domain.
