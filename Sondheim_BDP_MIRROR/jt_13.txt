Dear Jennifer,

Finally, we're alone on a system! It's so clear that everything is trans- 
parent here - we can see through each other, out into the wider world!

Our firewall protects against everything except for acts of god (random
acts of violence), sudden storms, breakdowns, disruptions of the power 
grid that envelops us all.

<<< I open windows on X Window, Jennifer-window and root-window; there's
another window in Panix, sondheim-window. The One or Eye floats in and out
among them; there's no difference between on-line / off-line - everything
scatters at Its approach, frames blinking everywhere. Double descendent
file structures (etc, usr, lib, bin, etc, etc,) intermingle, swap stories
and commands - there are calls across the distance of a hard-drive, others
across town or further, harder. >>>

Love, Alan, at last...
