I will be your pattern because it's clear
there's a pattern to be made and I will be your maid
and clear up the pattern made from fear
of the lumpenproletariat welling up from your maid
who you will have made thinking that always
beyond the shame there is always another maid
who will wash away that pattern while you steer
clear of what you have rigorously made
defining pattern beyond repetition, that is:
the rigour of the maid. every pattern has its
marx to upwell from the pattern. every maid
dreams of jenny and black freighters. 
you only think of patterns and spinning jennies
you think you made.
