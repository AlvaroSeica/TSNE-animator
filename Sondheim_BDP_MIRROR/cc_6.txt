Kyberspace: vi: the figure

when we make assumptions tendrils
crawl down or off the placement of mind down
where ground is inscribed with triangle Archimedes,
looking up at Roman soldiers' tendrils
from another tribe which wrote themselves as 
Romans would write themselves just like
this Greek bathed in words of tendrils
like a circle like a square
but "he did it"
because of cause
