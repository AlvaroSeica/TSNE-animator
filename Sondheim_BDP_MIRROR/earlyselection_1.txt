Prophet on the Mountain: Bringing Back the Image


So we took quickcam up to the mountain, plugged it into to the keyboard
and parallel ports of the NCR 486/25 and jammed the auto mode, not enough
time to upload and things went blank and crashed, over and over again - on
top of which the machine was in level three saving mode and so electricity
wasn't a problem but speed certainly was far and beyond its rated. So we
went up to the mountain today, prophets all, with the NCR 486/25 and the
quickcam and it was beginning to drizzle but there was a trashcan on fire
but we didn't take anything, nothing took. Fog rolling in like Fan Ku'an.
I have one image from the day before, back tomorrow just after the magic
twilight hour when quickcam does best - when contrast is low, shades are
soft and brother sister mountains greet everyone from a distance. More on
later, carrying awkward digitalia everywhere we & go.
