Parable of Nikuko-allergic


red smudged beneath the breast, molecular pools carrying pollen, fecal
matter into bloodstream, so that th' body in its dying throes begins
hysteria of autoimmune reactions, there come allergies, defenses of
violation fabric, hives appear, coughing, blood-eyes watering, 
flesh dying in simulacrum of a sneeze

th' out-of-doors invades a corpse filled with riot molecular units
giving up th' ghost
