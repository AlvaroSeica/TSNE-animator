the body parts

what's next for the body parts?
that they're preserved with care and tenderness.
often they're wrapped in twine, sometimes cloth.
conformal reasoning.
then they're placed in wood or clay, sometimes gold,
containers, and sometimes cloth.
sometimes laminar, and sometimes mucilage, 
reflecting the dull black char of the world.
they have the power of the ghosts who name them.
they always have a calling and a hearkening.
dried, they are bundles with surfaces that slide
their touch against the man or woman.
they impress themselves upon her and they are
her memory.
he becomes euphoric, a carrier, and will be known
as a carrier. they are all one they.
