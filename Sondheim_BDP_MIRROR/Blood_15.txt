	This ys the Space of Memory
	From whych eache Room is Opening
	Uponne another; thus Sophistry
	Doth doome the State of Ripening
	Those forced madly Hyther, lightening
	Theyr Burthen of Artystry, tempering
	Theyr Reason: Thus Avatars, murmuring
	Names of Others, Castigate those
	Borne of Galls of Foreyn Mothers.
	And soe Allegyance spake, in full Repose,
	Agaynst the Foe; thus, angered Fathers
	At last, upon the Bairn of Dusk arose:
	Foresaken are Those beneath what Dysmal Sygn
	Transpose theyr Selves, and steal what is Myne.
