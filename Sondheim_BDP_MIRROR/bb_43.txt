Wizards, Politics

One saying I am fond of: Build an application and both community and net 
sex will come. Another: Every MOO is a panopticon. 

Every wizard can change just about everything. The degree of power is 
frightening. 

But another saying: Build a MOO and there is politics. And the politics 
always develops back-room, in part because of whisper, page, email, etc. 

The point? To develop _another_ database with a sysadmin who couldn't 
hack it himself. To develop one with PGP or similar built in, translation 
based on passwords. To have these passwords external to the MOO.

Or: Build a talker in which .private automatically encrypts its contents.
Have the keys shared by interior players. 

The _addiction_ to the MOO is the addiction to the political, to the 
wages and fortunes of men and women simmering at love and war. It would 
happen anywhere.

Here it is stronger and said. Here it is a foundation of spent lives,
lives spent. I found myself. 

Meet me in the corner.
