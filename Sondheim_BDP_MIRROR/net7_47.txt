I don't know what happened but I am now NOT LOGGED into NETCO and am on

a different shell entirely with all sorts of blinking things - I just

got out of an AYN RAND IRC!!!

I don't have the vaguest Idea where I am (platonic or not) but I had 

better check out soon - system crashed.





I don't know who I am.
