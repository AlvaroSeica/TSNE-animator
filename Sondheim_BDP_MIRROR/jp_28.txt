Framing: The Imaginary _Thing_


The first web-page project is _Narcissistic Disturbance_; the second is
_Water, Jennifer_ which streams elsewhere than sexuality - developing a
_floating/drowning_ Jennifer, or a _swimming/cresting,_ or a _flooding/
rising_ Jennifer. The body remains by a principal of Archimedes immersed
and bound to rapture.

The web-page projects share similar frameworks, equivalent numbers of
images and frames. The only identical image is a transparent gif linking
the two. Every frame can be stretched, of course, across the screen. >>

The transparent gif melds a feminized body into background sunlight-cloud-
light. What of all of this?

HTML by itself blinks w/Netscape (MSE doesn't recognize this, but has mar-
quee movement); frames and targets create a surface broken, resurfaced, by
the user. There's little other movement; my gif isn't animated, there are
no add-ons, video, audio. The page links, shudders; frames target others
or themselves; recursivity clots the screen. 

With frames, content is lateral; you could construct a sliderule with two
aligned gifs of logarithmic scales. The link doesn't appear to jump in
depth; it skitters. Text alignment across frames creates other potential
content/readings. 

Because of the mouse, the scrollbars, the alignments, the fetishization of
the image, the blinking (different frames blink out of phase at equivalent
rates), the screen becomes the inscription of flesh, the cursor touching,
tracking it. Trails leave scars; scars turn leaves; the eyes, pressed, do
the imaginary _thing._
