the remnant three-dimensional image i have of the virtual environments 
laboratory at west virginia university, during the period we were making 
transformed motion-capture, and transformed scanning images of every- 
thing from body to mind, from vacuum tube to vajra. i move around the 
point-sets and pretend i'm back in the place (which has since been 
dismantled). i have sad memories which don't translate for anyone else, 
except azure, who appears, wraithe-like, ghost-like, holding somewhat 
still and quiet in the midst of the scanning operation; look carefully, 
you can see her there, sad memories, perhaps that is gary manes in the 
corner, perhaps only noise...

designer's abject revenge

http://www.alansondheim.org/libya.mov (takes a minute to load)

first it appeared wounded or blown apart,
then almost cartoon-like but sutured together
or trying to re-establish itself as life,
whatever that might be, covering up the mesh,
or skeins, or even nodes, it was hard to tell,
there had to be something to it, something
that had the scent of permanency or perhaps
a permanent odor, as blood and bruises 
tend to go the spectral length, running from
one liquid color to another



usa limelite

sometimes the limelite can't follow the dance
but opens internals of the structure of chance;
chaotic behavior kills your purposeful trance;
speed or momentum dissolve in the glance;
better these figures masquerade in the prance
than occupy deserts with morals askance

Story and Transform (for WVU talk)


Once upon a time, Harry rode out with Debbie into the forest. 
They were looking for trolls who wanted good time.
Four sitting on mushrooms and said,
"Hello, fine trolls, this is an even number of days we have." 
At point, forest grew very still, Lou Reed,
two said in union, "How odd." The sky dark enormous loins mountain gave 
birth to crystal
springs. fir trees shook their trunks against stars,
as if say, hello, are you, though no one else is.
But gods heard one, Hittite gods, speaking
Luwian, Reed had nowhere turn; it was Mitanni
raised horses. disappeared from story. four did too. Only remain, giving 
birth, time mortals forgive them.
