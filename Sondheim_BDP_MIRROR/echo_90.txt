   Don't get me started.

   I'm tired of your complaining, Nikuko.

   You'd better watch it, young lady.

   You can't pull the wool over everyone's eyes.





   Mom, mom, I'm not trying to do anything.

   You're always picking on me.

   Just leave me alone, will you.

   Take it easy, for crying out loud.





   You're asking for it, Nikuko.

   Don't try my patience, Nikuko.

   One of these days I'm going to snap.

   Stop your whining this instant, Nik.





   Mom, mom, just shut up for a while.

   Watch your tongue, young lady.





   Mom, mom, you're always picking on me.

   Just get out of my sight, Nikuko.





   Mom, mom, you're just so horrible.
