NIKUKO TEXTS - see http://www.anu.edu.au/english/internet_txt/
kz, la, lb for samples


[ The texts below are from the Nikuko avatar I use in my work. The various
avatars interact with me, with various applications such as Internet Relay
Chat, and with email lists; the texts I produce are sent to two lists, Cy-
bermind and Fop-l (fiction of philosophy), which I co-moderate. The ava-
tars raise all sorts of issues, and give me the opportunity to explore the
practical and theoretical aspects of 'virtual subjectivity.' Below are
several representative texts; these usually are presented along with more
abstract works analyzing the issues involved. ]
