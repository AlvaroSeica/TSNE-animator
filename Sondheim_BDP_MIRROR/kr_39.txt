Recapitalized Bachelard, Jolas Trans lation, and

Paragraph of the Dis located Jaw, Conclusion of the Cave

Look within Yeselves, Words Bro ken or Broken Teeth

Somebody who has to Sweep the Writing Into Ex istence

Vision which has no Visor or Ob jects of your Fascination

Fastenings on the Grid, Rumors of Anti cipated Things

Withdrawals from the Grid, Tel ling before Naming

Conclusions of Swollen Life, So und and Bones Protruded

'Such Data as These can Receive Nothing from the Out Side

World but Illustrations', 'These I mages Blot Out the World

And They have no Pa st', 'They do not Stem from any Earlier

Ex perience', 'Naturally, this is an Exaggerated Image', 

And 'It real ly is Open to the Wind of Another Time,' for

The Tel ling has All the Time in the World, Something, and

The Time among the Links and Co uplings, Intersticing, for

No More Than the Tit le, No Less Than the Footnote, since

Between The Tit le and the Foot note, Where the Wor ld

Crumb les A nd in A Whim per, No Ban g, B u t*
