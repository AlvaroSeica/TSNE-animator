" - express the mythical identity of one 'Sabeth the Forsaken,' a frustra-
ted woman neglected by a lover

"_whose body juices were all spent upon the paper [on which he was writing
*Voyage*] the fountain of his sex turned inward; the exploration of her
flesh was nothing when compared to the penetration of the vast labyrinth
within. The quest for monsters demanded monstrous denial. Thus, she would
become 'Sabeth, the Forsaken,' to his friends. Magnificent and futile, she
roamed the streets of Montmartre; drank nightly in the bars; let them
caress her in his stead. In his presence, even,_"

Ostrovsky, Voyeur Voyant, quoted in Elizabeth and Louis, Elizabeth Craig
talks about Louis-Ferdinand Celine, Alphonse Juilland and Nikuko thinking
about all of this and how to deal with the magick gothic, high and other-
wise, so futile! while she wrytes and writhes away her life spent outward,
inversion-M.-Celine, just a moment now! while she raises a drink for a
final toast before closing time: a hunger, mysterious impulse, seizes her
as she enters these lines into the machinery, skin stretched to the limit,
threaded through the maze of world and desire,

just a minute, little Jennifer! reeling back from the force and effort of
all of it, turned with flame & fury Towards that Text that placed Itself
in the Sky outside the St- Antoine, now so stars and now, and now

     **          *        and someday Jennifer will be upon the sea
     *            *       and she will look above the crest of wave

                          and she will turn, she will turn to the stars
                          she will turn towards the dark night and the 
                          moon

                          she will turn tricks and planets and she will
                          sing

                         
      
                          now I remember you
                          and now I remember you

                     
                          I remember now
