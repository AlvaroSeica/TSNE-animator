Eating my flesh I devour my name. I did something, not your anything,

just something. I never had a name. I never watched anything. I went

into the streets, carried the black flag of anarchy, the red flag

of revolution. I went into the streets. I fought well, overturned the

cobblestones, went alone up to the tank with a flower in my hands.
