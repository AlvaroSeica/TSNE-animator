Hokusai in Kyoto-MOO (by Nikuko)


 "When a woman lives alone, her house should be extremely dilapidated, the
mud wall should be falling to pieces, and if there is a pont, it should be
overgrown with water-plants. It is not essential that the garden be cov-
ered with sage-brush, but weeds should be growing through the sand in
patches, for this gives the place a poignantly desolate look.
 "I greatly dislike a woman's house when it is clear that she has scurried
about with a knowing look on her face, arranging everything just as it
should be, and when the gate is kept tightly shut."
 (Sei Shonagon, The Pillow Book, trans. Morris)

Thus are dilapidated MOOs, with solitaries wandering about, testing soft-
ware that remains as fresh as the day it was born, always yearning for the
moment when it will be suddenly brought back into brilliant life, only
once more to be abandoned until the next comer. Such crying software,
magnetic domains almost never accessed, their creators long since vanished
from the dying planet. Such sad abandoned cities, lanes, light rail sys-
tems and zeppelins, bars with bartender bots weeping for lack of customers
and remembering the happier times when the place was filled with chatting
carefree people. Thus the world is in ruins, once my eyes settle down,
closed against the noise and misery of the street. Nowadays we should shut
our gates; our destruction is our dwelling-space, our wounds, the latest
fashion.
