Coming Together, Again, or Who is Speaking Here


that Jennifer with her frock and her ground began thinking about the
freighter and identity

that freighters were narratives

that she wondered about narrative as well, that the freighter turned in
the water, that she thought:

Pirate Jenny, that she thought about the black freighter and the revo-
lution, Pirate Jenny and Playwright Brecht

that she created Brecht just as she created me

that freighters were uncomfortable docked by land, that they loved the
water and the turning of the sea

that the weather sent them home in the middle of the harbor, Desert Falcon
first, now the Aurora still out there with winds howling, snow skirting
the frames of things

that they sought land only in order to move, that they were vectors or
avatars of movement

so that here in this house, Jennifer and Kristen and Jason would wonder:

where is Macau; what countries border on Italy; where is Mandalay; what is
south of Singapore; what surrounds Saudi Arabia; where is Cox's Bazar; who
lives in Sikkim; tell Jennifer about the South China Sea; what is New-
foundland style fiddle; what is the history of Slovenia; what surrounds
Ethiopia and what is its capital; where is the Pole of Inaccessibility; 
what are Borneo and Sumatra; describe the Thai peninsula; what are the
borders of the Russian Federation; where is Timbuktu and what is its cur-
rent spelling; what countries share a border with Honduras; what is Bur-
undi; describe a strathspey; tell me about the South China Sea.

just look at the leeward islands and their histories, colonialism all over
the place, chaotic regimes transgressing transparent topographies.

the boats carried northamerican dolomite to southamerican ports. 

history hammered itself across the skein of freighters' wakes, silent and
dead and black and trailing and all movment, and Jennifer, philosophy.
Braudel would have gathered the lines of a text, balked at identity; per-
haps he did.

Jennifer would have wondered. Take her seriously.
