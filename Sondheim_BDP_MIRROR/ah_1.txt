Avatars

Avatars as identities assumed, also identities unknown. Text can never 
reveal obdurate alterity. Historiography's dependence on text mixed with
archaeological investigation leaves gaps, annihilations, as if species 
were distinguished in the process of extinction. Two examples, both from 
Gelb, Old Akkadian Inscriptions in Chicago Natural History Museum. These 
are over forty-two hundred years old (2261-2199 b.c.e.):

1. The name. Tablet 29. Only the obverse is inscribed, four lines:

_Gal-pum_                   Kalbum         (KLV, Heb. Ar. root _dog_)
DUMU _Su-ba-ri-im_          son of Subarijum     (DUMU Sumerian)
_Na-num_                    Nanum             
DUMU _Zi-na-num_            son of Zinanum

Two fathers, two sons, no commentary, no legal or religious text, no 
accountancy. A chiasm, parallel or crossing at work. Articulation of 
doubled enclosures, parallel relationships, annihilated past and fu- 
ture, untethered. MOO-work, as in ][ .

2. The gender. Tablet 30. Eleven lines, two problematic words, eight 
persons:

Obverse: 1 _A-ti-e_
         [1] _Es(4)-dar-dam-ga-at_
         [1] _Es(4)-dar-ra-bi-at_
         1 _I-za-za_
         SES.SAL _Li-bur-ri-im_
         1 _A-li-li_
         SES.SAL _A-bi-bi_

Reverse: [space]
         1 _Sa-lim-me-ni_
         1 _Es(4)-dar-du-gul-ti_
         1 _Ri-i-tum_
         1 ku-lu-u

Two (Sumerian) SES.SAL, SES brother, SAL woman, woman/brother, thus Alili
to Abibi perhaps (Avi, Hebrew, "my father," "Aba," Yiddish). Izaza is also
SES.SAL to someone. Gelb states that Kraus translates SAL.SES for "sis-
ter," questioned by Gelb, looking further, perhaps at SAL.SES, reading SIS
in Sumerian, Akkadian equivalent _sik-ri-tu,_ then translated by Landsber-
ger (note all the Germans at work here!) as "weibliche Manner,"  feminine
men perhaps yet again. The given root is ZKR - "Driver and Sir John C. 
Miles, in a study entitled 'The SAL-ZIKRUM "Woman-Man" in Old Babylonian
Texts,' Iraq VI (1939 66-70), proposed the translation "eunuch" or "epi-
cene" for SAL-ZIKRUM and differentiated it from _zikritu_ or _sigri/eti,_ 
which they translate as 'enclosed woman.'" 

Then there is _ku-lu-u,_ applied to the persons on the reverse, which
according to Gelb "should correspond to the word _kulu um,_ discussed by
Meissner in AOTU I1 (1916) p. 50 and translated by him as 'male prosti-
tute, lover.'"

Gender flies everywhere; roots and interpretations transform, skitter
across occidental identities and institutions. I'm fascinated that Fried-
rich states (in Sturtevant's A Hittite Glossary) that _gullakuwan_ is neu-
tral, perhaps meaning "soiled, defiled." But now I am into bad etymology, 
hacking/backing out.
