Annoying Behavior

Annoying and annoyance are difficult to analyze. Yet they form a behav- 
ioral matrix, appearing in such forms as teasing, taunting, daring, 
whining, infuriating, and seducing. The phenomenology of annoyance is 
complex; among animals, annoyance plays roles ranging from deflection to 
prey production. Crows and other birds will annoy hawks; smaller birds 
will annoy crows - in both cases to lead the larger birds away from 
potential prey. Egrets on the other hand will annoy bottom-dwellers, which 
flee their hiding-places and are caught. Their behavior ranges from wing- 
flapping and circling to leg vibrating and kicking back. These actions 
change quickly, decreasing the likelihood for a steady-state response by 
potential prey. It's unclear to what degree this behavior is learned or 
instinctual. See http://www.asondheim.org/annoyingegret.mp4 - a snowy 
egret at dawn in the Bolsa Chica wetlands, Huntington Beach, California. 
Other examples - chipmunks, squirrels, and various bird species taunting 
rattle-snakes; coyote and other large predatory animals harrowing prey; 
annoying by the weaker and taunting by the stronger, among humans.

Our Future

In 1973 I taught "The Year 3000" at the Rhode Island School of Design. 
Most of the predictions described for the year 2000 have already occurred. 
Now for the modest future of thirty years hence:

All megafauna in the wild will be extinct. The population of the earth 
will be close to its carrying capacity. Disease will run rampant due to 
pollution. Global warming will bring about fast-forward environmental 
effects, including rising seas, increased desertification, and extremely 
violent hurricanes. The life-span of humans will begin a temporarily 
exponential decrease. The rich will live in highly defended enclaves. 
Fundamentalisms will be the order of the day, since belief alone commands. 
Terrorism will be increasing exponentially, since future paradise is all 
there is. Capitalism will be bankrupt as national currencies collapse and 
world-wide depression sets in. The information explosion will continue on 
localized data-networks and stuttering global communication systems. The 
global communications infrastructure will have reached its carrying 
capacity as well. For the first time, information will begin to corrode, 
decay, as structures can no longer be protected against the world-wide 
environmental crisis. The smaller generalist flora and fauna will begin to 
dominate the earth. Great portions of the globe will be uninhabitable. The 
larger aquatic species will have gone extinct, and the oceans will be 
dominated by off-shore algal blooms. Most urban drinking water supplies 
will be polluted and rationed. Suburbs will be abandoned as gasoline 
becomes an almost inaccessible commodity. The planet will seethe with 
continuous war, no longer fought among nation-states, but among private 
militias, guerilla groups, and individual cowboys. Religions and 
extremisms will be intertwined. There will be heavily-defended holdouts in 
the North American mountains, and relatively isolated land masses such as 
New Zealand. Fluid urban structures will be composed of well-armed gangs 
dealing with the major currency of drugs and weaponry. At least a third of 
all births will result in deformed infants. Ozone depletion will be almost 
complete and skin cancers will be exponentially increasing. Most hospitals 
world-wide will have closed their doors to all but the extremely wealthy. 
Knowledge-structures will have broken down as specialization and increased 
mathematical difficulties result in the problematizing of any theoretical 
work at hand. Computers will have reached a plateau of speed, complexity, 
and miniaturization. They will not have achieved consciousness. Robotics 
and nanotechnologies will not be the order of the day - plagues will. 
Sports franchises will be local and heavily subsidized. The air will be 
almost unbreathable, and asthma / allergic reactions will be one of the 
primary causes of death. Most deaths however are the result of violence. 
Local police will perform rearguard holding actions at best. Highway 
systems will have fallen into disrepair as economies collapse. Air travel 
will be almost non-existent; space travel will have disappeared. The space 
station will be a rusted hulk, if it has not already plummeted to earth. 
Literacy will be on the decline. There will be a world-wide energy crisis. 
Child abuse will have become child use and child discard; a high 
percentage of children will be proffered for labor and sexual slavery, in 
return for food and goods. Informal economies and the barter system will 
characterize most local trade. Transnational trade will be at a minimum. 
The genetic revolution will result in new and uncontrollable pandemics as 
viruses and bacteria become increasingly resistant. Highly modifiable 
immune deficiency diseases will appear on an exponentially-increasing 
basis. The greatest percentage of murder victims, per capita per age 
level, will be the elderly. Despair will be transformed into religious 
salvation. More than twenty nuclear weapons, most of them small and 
poorly-constructed, will have been exploded in various urban areas. Most 
of the countries of the world, such as they are, will have weapons 
programs which will absorb a large proportion of the gross national 
product. Political economy will be ad hoc. Political ideologies will be 
fragmentary and situational. Electrical grids will be hard-put to maintain 
even the most minimal of services. The arts will have reached the limits 
of extremity, with suicidal art movements in the fields of theater, 
performance, ballet, and installation. The new media 'movement' will have 
become a thing of the past. Art history will have disappeared as museums 
fall victim to gang warfare and destruction. Most national heritage 
monuments will have been at least partially destroyed. Most populations 
will be drugged...

Philosophy of [spam] Pornography

"How're you doing? Pelite teen pussy doing all sort of nasty things: 
masturbating, licking pussy, fingering herself [...] The 1980s are to debt 
what the 1960s were to sex.  The 1960s left a hangover. So will the 1980s. 
Just girls, playing, posing hot and teasing each other. Action is 
coarsened thought thought becomes concrete, obscure, and unconscious. 
Don't waste your chance to see beauty in the very prime of life ! Refrain 
from asking what going to happen tomorrow, and everyday that fortune 
grants you, count as gain. He seems determined to make a trumpet sound
