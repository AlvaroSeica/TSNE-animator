Jami


Here is an anecdote about Jami. One time he recited the line, 

You are so steadfast in my desolated soul and insomniac eye,
That whoever should appear from a distance, I should think it were you!

An irreverent bystander interrupted, asking, 

Suppose it were an ass?

I should think it were you!

said Jami.
 

And I think you are everywhere, perched upon my shoulder, beneath my fing-
ers on the keys, watching me from the other side of the screen, sharing my
bed. And I think that were it any of the things of this world, still it
would be you. And were it any of the people of this world, still it would
be you. And were it any of the emanants, or any of the worlds themselves:
still, it would be you.


Someone said to Jami, the poets have stolen my ideas. That's obvious, said
Jami, since you have none.
