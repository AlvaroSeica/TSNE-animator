sutra (nikuko)

1

the brushed circle beginning and ending
there's always place to enter, place to leave
energy across the place, that's the secret

on computer: all at once, the photographic circle:
it appears, isn't drawn, nothing moving around -
it's as if the world were always already stasis
it's as if the world were always already in preparation

digital objects, analog beginnings and endings
cycles within cycles, brush touching and leaving
from one to another point

you can find me here and there

shattering all worlds, i forget their number
dreamlike, i build them in software graphics build
they are swollen, tumescent; they are flat liars
what are their names, do they have any

"i will build all worlds and i will make speech
"i will make language and i will make spaces
"i will move over spaces and read potentials
"i will decide and i will be decided

this world which is shattered comes forward
it begins the creation of beings and languages
it gathers together and creates, remembers number
they will have names, they will have numbers, speech

"we will remember and forget what no longer exists
they will no longer exist, nothing has been forgotten
without memory, without being and language, without worlds
within and without, unmoved and moving
