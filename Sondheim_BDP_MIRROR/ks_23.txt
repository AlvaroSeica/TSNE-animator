meagre measure to measure

let's measure the line on the page
the line has a length and might do something tricky
it might define an area
inside and outside, the jordan curve theorem
it might be an area, fractal as all get-go
get out of here with nowhere to go

let's hope the line remains there
it's go nowhere to go
you might remind it of something
but it's got no brain and can't be reminded

so we've gone to the end of the line
the end.
