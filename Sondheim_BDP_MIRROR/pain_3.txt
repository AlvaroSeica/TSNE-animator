Hi Sandy, doesn't pain negate and foreclose the signifier? The pain of the 
signifier for me is the pain of the _incision_ accompanying inscription; 
the world simultaneously expands and narrows. In Buddhism, I'd imagine 
(I'm fuzzy at the moment) all signifiers equal and empty; suffering and 
attachment imbues distinction with intentionality, capture.

The signifier's sharp; the numbness is what's created in the act of 
distinction. So the signifier's x^-x, that stuff I wrote about a while 
back about the intersection of a set and its complement relativized in 
relation to the 'content' of the set; if x = apple, then 0-sub-apple is 
the intersection of x^-x. So classically this is very sharp, 'smeared' out 
in the real via abjection.

The signifier's not in the place of pain except for the observer; for the 
person undergoing (severe) pain, there is no place at all: that's the 
numbness. The signifier's the report; the distance between the report and 
the pain is also painful...

Could you elaborate on the third hand? Not sure I understand - (Alan)
