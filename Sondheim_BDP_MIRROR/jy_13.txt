Plural Dark Angels of the Night


You came to me like plural dark angels of the night.
I was about to compose a brilliant text on the density of my language.
I began thinking of your brilliant arrival a month ago, like plural
   dark angels of the night.
My language dissolved like sloppy seconds at my feet (I'm not gonna
   have no feet).
I wanted to reply about this, the nature of language and brilliant feet.
I wanted to write about languages interspersed, interpenetrated in this
   machine, languages and information everywhere, like plural dark angels
   of the brilliant sloppy night.
I thought of our arms like grapple-hooks around each other.
Language clattered like a bowl of boiling coffee spilled on my feet.
I thought of our teeth against brilliant skin confused with passion like
   plural dark angels of the night.
There was something else I wanted to write; I thought of your brilliant
   eyes.
I wanted to write about your eyes; I thought of your brilliant mouth, your
   limbs.
I thought about the feet of the plural dark angels of the night.
I thought, I thought.
I thought, brilliant, you know where this is going so I'm not gonna write
   no more.
