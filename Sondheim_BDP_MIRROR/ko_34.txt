there is a staircase, leading down
from this old house
from this old house
and it's dark down there, where there might be
in this old house
in this old house
shall i take the stairs, tread carefully
down this old house
down this old house
they go forever, fearfully
from this old house 
from this old house

i wander down in dark, doom, drab,
with worry dark, with that dark fear
that no one's here, that the world is stark
down those bleak stairs, while all around
there are weak stares from passers-by,
transparent, faint, afraid to cry
afraid to speak, and I walk by,
by this old house I take my walk,
and it's been years since I could talk,
and I begin at last to die

and I shall never find the door
but I shall lie on this cold floor
or fall forever down these grey stairs
in this old house
in this old house
