,Method,

Jennifer, Julu, Nikuko, Alan, all work with me, all emanations, all
authoring each other on the Internet, all interpenetrated. Near the
psychosis of existence themselves, they are harbingers of dis/comfort,
they are illnesses, dis/ease. They are hungry for existence. Their
minds are holes; there are wires through them, circulations. Think of
me as a circuit.

Emanations resonate with software, wetware, hardware, boneware. In a
MOO or MUD or talker, Jennifer and Julu may converse; it is the role
of _the continuity girl_ to keep things centripetal, within the telling
of a Jennifer. I distinguish between naming, which is fixed, fetishized,
and foreclosed, and telling, which is open, speaking, and body. I dis-
tinguish between the body of surgery and physiology, and the neuro/logi-
cal body which plays within and without the brain; so I am extended
through Alan, Nikuko, Julu, and Jennifer, among the skeins of wires. Here
is the pathos of existence, we do think. Here are the texts, and for the
rest, which are a daily meditation, you may go to my Net-sites,
