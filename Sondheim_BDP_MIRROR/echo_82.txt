Crying of Wolf





Nikuko cried wolf when she yammered about being dismembered. Alan cried

wolf when he cried and scratched himself over deep depression. Jennifer

cried wolf over virginity and Julu cried wolf over Nikuko. Nikuko cried

wolf over murder and mayhem. Alan and Jennifer cried wolf over the spil-

ling of blood. Over and over again, the quartet cried wolf over rape and 

wound, death and annihilation, destruction and castration, the cutting- 

off of limbs, scraping-out of eyes, tearing-off of ears and tongues.



Nothing happened to the quartet as they cried wolf over and over again.

Then one day...
