roots iv, envelope of the star

every number unique, virtual, violation fabric in the midst of stripped
particles, waves spanning space itself, gravitational, importunate,
granular

burned in the plasma of the solar annihilation, ashes, evaporations

unrecognized nominalisms, no universals except the broken manifolds of
conflagration, lustmord darkened with differentials, actions, truncations,
star-teeth

no searching for the lost or absent: no "one," as in the "lost or absent
one" 

there is no memory. there is no history. there cloaks the nude body of 
the woman lying on the persian rug. 

_the roots configure a random collection of nodes drowned in plasmas near 
the speed of light in vacuo, rhizomes project as tubules cauterized from 
the mother-lode charred into imminent disappearance. they flee the realm, 
burned sparks of dissolute forms shape-riding matter into total disap- 
pearance. _nothing remarkable._

this conditions the uninscribed center, alphabetic disappearance. absence 
of disavowal as well. _and nothing springs to mind.__

:this is the _ending of roots._
