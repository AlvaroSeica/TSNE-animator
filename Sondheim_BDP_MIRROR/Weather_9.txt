If I die, may I die in one of the twin cities of Kyoto!
May I die in that forlorn one, that of corrupt transmissions, emptied, 
of bots and people!

tak-ku LU _EL-LAM_ MUS- an ku- en- zi da- me-e- el- la _SUM_ an te- iz- 
zi 1 MA.NA.KU.BABBAR pa-a- i tak-ku IR- sa a-pa-a-as-pit a- ki:

If a free man kills a snake and speaks another's name, 
he gives a pound of silver; if a slave does that one, he's killed!

I wander the halls of the One, knowing the Other is full of laughter. 
I am from the URU of Kyoto, the KUR of Kyoto; I am DINGIR there. 

My bots are no longer my own; taking _upu_ runes, 
I have refused quota to myself, harboring the bytes of a poor man! 
Goat. Goat. Goat. Goat. Goat.

If I die, may the Yurt of Kyoto greet me! 
May the mewling human, squeezed, flood Kyoto with bones and cauldron! 

Hieroglyphs! Twin Worlds torn apart at the base! 
Death in one, multitudes in the other!
(I dream of the multitudes! 
I swarm among them, alas, only in my dreams!)

If I die, may I die in one of the twin cities of Kyoto!
