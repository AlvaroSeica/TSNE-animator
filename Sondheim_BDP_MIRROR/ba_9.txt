Old-Growth


I am sitting in the middle of old-growth forest, writing this on an HP
palmtop in the midst of the largest Sitka spruce in the world, up to 95
meters. I write this after the fact of the sitting, in my relative's
house, just as the real forms links, say, with rave dj's hypertexting 
vinyl records one after the other, juxtaposition. Juxtaposition, concat- 
enation in another domain, binds by virtue of vicinity; it's the frame 
problem all over again, finding a path through the world's accumulation. 

Which brings up old-growth and reincarnation which comes from old-growth,
to the extent that the _vectors_ of life/death are lost, occluded; the
result is a melange of manifolds and fragmentations: a spruce rots, falls,
is reabsorbed with lichen, moss, bacteria, termites, ants, and so forth,
in various stages - including the production of new spruce from the old,
vertical trunks soaring at right-angles from and out of, the supposedly
dead trunk. Everything churns into and through everything else; the world 
cycles through the world. Most importantly, _submergence and emergence 
merge,_ nothing comes, conjoins, leaves.

Which, as I've pointed out over and over again, nets the state of the Net.
Reincarnation coming from old-growth transforms into the diffusion of life
and death; one can't do better than absorb the problematic of identity and
loss in such conditions. Net-entanglement isn't far behind; old-growth is
the Ur of the world, still, no matter how much our clean and proper bodies
attempt to revive death itself, with more or less success.
