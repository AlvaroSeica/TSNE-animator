into the sward the knight rode the prove his point xxxxxxxxx
the night rode in on a mare xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
the seas of the moon poured tears of violation fabric xxxxxx
that remembered the joust that remembered the lance xxxxxxxx
island said, how do you do write suicide in avant-garde xxxx
the stallion gripped her sides called flanks xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
outing them in the avant-garde; in this world xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
everything talked, the sward said, the point said, xxxxxxxxx
the night cried, mare nayed, ululation seas, xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
like a rock, in the new moon's arms, like an island xxxxxxxx
in the joust's-last-word's song so very long xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
so long xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
