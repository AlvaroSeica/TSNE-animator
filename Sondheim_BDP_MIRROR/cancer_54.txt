History

My mother was dying in the hospice; I went in through the doors, found
myself unable to proceed. There was fluorescent light, world of red and
chrome. I did leave distraught. I did go back to sleep. Later, my father
was in the hospice; I went in again through the doors, found myself unable
to proceed. I simply could not. I did go back to sleep. Later, I was sit-
ting at the kitchen table with my sister in the house we grew up in. There
was a rare program on television. I did insist on taping it, knowing in
ten years we would want to see how we lived. Storm clouds were gathering
outside. I say outside because this was not an argument. Children came in
who were related to us; my sister did ask them to be quiet. The young girl
was upset, and when my sister did leave, I said to her, my sister was just
like you. We all had to be quiet because the tape machine had a live mike
and it would pick up everything we said as well as the program. I noticed
I held the mike and it was disconnected and we could make much sound in
the present-day and I woke up.
