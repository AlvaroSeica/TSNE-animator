ballad:

this morning i did catch the eyes of god
it's huge and yellow under blue-grey lids
unexpected, everything so there and bright
it looked like night would look without the skids

there's far too much to see, too much to taste
in this world gone white, far too many things
unexpected, all things there, a sight
that needs the shuddered blackness without wings

to load it dreary down, focus my thought, my speech,
so each to each, nothing left but light
applied to one and then another and then beseeched
and done without the blight of too much light

coda:

in blackness thought thinks light; god's eyes
blind humans from the light; speech ties
words to things and things to words; light flies
from them; speech cries

perfect love

lovely hummingbird, delicate and caring of i am the pure swan to myself,
covered and ugly, i am not a lovely hummingbird, lover, her nightmare
lovely nipple-period as pure as my pink-brown perusing wires,and do you
know we have lovely routers entering, feeding the ears to their lovely
shit-covered on wet flesh daughter, wives; and love screams, they shit
shit-covered missiles raining down on unarmed others. Look Julu. Julu is
wearing lovely white panties. wearing lovely white panties.

the other. Look Alan. Alan is wearing lovely white panties. His penis
presses against lovely white cotton cloth. removes panties. Alan's penis
has net sex, or falls in love online, or writes of error message headers -
I love the repetition in it, as if something is morphing and logos, in
more ways than one, in the thorns of love screaming against your holes on
the way to **perfect love is always interruption** your belly, holes and
fabrics drawn from love and nature.

the people are invisible and I do not love them and will not learn to love
them. skin tears along those lines separating us. Our love will bring the
planes down. Our love makes the growth of every carried medusa, your cock
is stone, i love your your vomit, your milk, beautiful. We choose to fuck
and love violently and hard. **we die for our love, our flesh and blood
feeds all their talk of human freedom** beloved Julu, carefully prepared
for her death, wrecking her diet. I can't believe He loves me, He makes
me.

after Reptition

^
so one or the other watches the other or the one leave the talker
leave the chat or leave the moo or leave the mud or irc
then the one remaining has the place-space to talk freely forever
no one is around to listen or remark or take good notice of words
sometimes they'll be in logs and memories of configured software
sometimes they're gone forever and in any case no one cares
caring is a reaching-out and empathy which displaces emptiness
but emptiness remains alone when the other or one has left
fragility is the day's order in the guise of magnetic domains
domains are swept by magnetic fields of earths and moons and stars
there's such sadness when someone leaves the talker moo or mud
there's such a loss that the space is oddly emptied and incomplete
moving around there's no one in any of the rooms or programmed spaces
there's no one digging or creating or posting secret messages or mail
the wizards have gone home taking gods and programmers with them
no visiting guests come in to entertain the solitary speaker
the leaving is remarked but the entering is lost and never so
remarking falls short of sadness and deep despair
words upon words falter as the solitary walker speaks her last
she logs and saves her sad departing words for future generations
in tears and pathos she offers them for people yet unborn
to you as well these words are given in the spirit of true eternity
all lost all found all present unaccounted for
in repetition all these writings resonate upon the same
i'm here in worlds of others' making and you have left these spaces
and in such leaving you have made both narratives and culture
and one becomes the other and the other one and physics is created
and programming and repetitions looping: if X, then Y, else Z.

after after Repetition


let ^ signify the beginning of the newest line
let $ signify the ending of the oldest
then what is between constitutes, within repetition, the accumulation of
enunciations world-wide and forever
please note the lack of punctuation in the initial commentary; line after
line leading to line after line
until the formalism in the final, stuttering to a halt and at the same
time deploying itself, opening up new and undefined territory
as in : if A then B else C - in which A and B are already constituted
as one and the other, C isolated, indescribable, a dummy or virtual 
variable
Alan  Sondheim>> Nikuko we're battering ourselves once again in
     an empty table
Alan  Sondheim>> as in : if A then B else C - in which A and B
     are already constituted
Alan  Sondheim>> please note the lack of punctuation in the initial
     commentary; line after
Alan  Sondheim>> line as everything remains unconstituted. But
     this chat is reduced ad nihilo to an extreme, the inability
     to function past the addition of one or another line, all
     these forkings leading nowhere - one can only talk; I beg
     for action and 
  - there's none forthcoming - none at all. So then one wonders,
     what is the size of the buffer, how can one modulate other
     forms of response here? and nothing comes to mind - neither
     this paragraph nor any other. And it continues oddly in this
     fashion
  hoping that more and more will join the ranks as time goes on...
Alan Sondheim>> until all of our are speechless in our presence
so that language "might resume at a pace"
Alan Sondheim>> worrying the subjunctive literally to death, another
  form of carving out uneven territories.
  You could begin here:
  Alan  Sondheim>> or you could begin in an other space: \there:
       but again, within this chat, there is no action, no possibility:
	    the body's returned ONLY to speech, not even the semblance
		 of an appearance: I await Nikuko who has not checked in
		 (or rather,
	      as in the sense of a hospital, has \checked out
	      Alan  Sondheim>> or is busy checking mail
	      Alan  Sondheim>> or "doing something else"
	      Alan  Sondheim>> as if there is something else to do
	      Alan  Sondheim>> when we're waiting for your reply, Nikuko
	      Alan  Sondheim>> "in this busy world"
	      Alan  Sondheim>> else you're \checking out
