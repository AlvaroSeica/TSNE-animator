they live in the world already gone
one pulls the other inside out
what is left, blood marking the body
breasts grow from breasts, the two are hungered
i would eat your flesh, she says, dancing
my eyes cut your body in two, he says, looking
lips grow from lips, the two in struggle
inside of him, she screamed violently
inside of her, he twisted in her fit
their names were erased by the war
you're watching the bodies of survivors
you're watching bodies which are dead by now
everything you take from them is all they have
you're a thief, you've stolen their holes
you're a thief, you've stolen their mouths
their bodies are broken, corrupted
their corrupted bodies are broken, hanged
carnage and ecstasy, they do it for you
carnage and ecstasy, they do it for them
