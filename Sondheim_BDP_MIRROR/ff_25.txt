Weatherman to Tell You Which Way the Packet Goes


The weatherman monitors the you-are. She ritualizes the health of site
after site, traceroutes the veins of the world, unites families and home-
lands, cauterizes lovers, breaks the psyche into two. She follows the
vagaries of new countries, from megabyte to centibaud and back again. The
weatherman with her laser pointer anoints the map of nodes and backbone
penetrations. She is responsible. She is responsible for the _overall
picture._ She determines the picture. 

She _is_ the picture. The weatherman is overall display, the protrusion of
the there-is. The weatherman is the there-is-it, the for-there-is. She
changes nothing. She wears no clothes. She is traced herself. She traces
her traces and that is who she is. She monitors the you-are. You are glad
to have her round and around.
