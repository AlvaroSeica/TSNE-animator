for your eyes only
for the connoisseur of erotica, http://www.asondheim.org/exhibit.mov ,
and who is the voyeur here, who performs, who watches, who freezes frames, 
shuddering with delight at the 'classical' presentation of forbidden 
pleasures. for your eyes only, two days.



my sister's murder

you murdered my sister but i can get you off
my sister can get you off
afterwards you got off the bus
you murdered my sister but i can put you off for a while
afterwards she put you off the bus
afterwards you were put off the scent of death
look my sister gave up the ghost
when she came for you you gave up
you took up far too much of her time
she took up sex to forget you
now you get take-out whenever you can
trying to forget you once took her out
that night she gave out a bit of advice
the car gave out when you fled the crime
she screamed get out but you didn't leave
she got out of your way when you came for her
you put her out with the garbage and other stuff
because she'd put out and you wouldn't take
yes for an answer





get attention, how are you getting on

get attention, get a lot of attention
swing it, get into the swing of it, get into full swing
give a look, give a stare, give a cold stare
give a dreadful stare, get offended
wrong person, wrong place, don't get me wrong
give a hard look at, give a long hard look at
get what one has coming, get on one's feet, on one's feet
give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
someone has to give her mouth-to-mouth
would you scoot over, would you make a little room for me
would you squeeze me in, nail, nail someone, get nailed
why don't you give yourself a little sniff of this perfume
get a kick out of, get a thrill, gives me a thrill
pleasure, get pleasure out of something
get a laugh, get the big laughs, have the last laugh on it
get something out of it, get a lot out of it,
applause, give a hand, give a big and
give someone the run-around, get a run-around
give a stretch, give a stretch and a yawn, give a yawn
get nothing out of it, condense a sentence
a glare, give someone a glare, give someone a hostile glare
get something down to it, you're not quite yourself today
what's come over you, what's gotten into you
getting nervous and excited, how are you getting on

without order

i tried to deal without order, to apply topology, surfaces, 
to the digital, construct for example a sphere:
within the sphere, curvature is uniform, there are no objects, 
no striations; now consider a torus:
within a certain angle, vision is blocked, the cylinder connects,
connects smoothly above and below, of genus one in placement
nearby genus zero:
but these inhering differences go no further, elasticity problematizes
order within any configuration as handles, holes, bridges slide,
everywhere, ignoring the metric, there is no metric, let's make one,
just for the moment, no, it's useless:
so that there's something uncanny about the sphere's interior, we move, 
near and far, we reflect upon ourselves, 
something luminous must there be, or we dream of such, luminosity,
ourselves written, large within our world:
without order, there's nothing, it's all unaccountable, can holes merge,
of course they can, can bridges slide in deep interiors, yes and yes,
nothing is here, sphere to torus, but something to nothing, nothing
to something, always just invisible, for how may one leap, from sphere,
to torus, torus, to sphere, how may one cross, erecting order ?



CREPUSCLE and WAREQUIEM, 2007


Alan Sondheim, Foofwa d'Imobilite, Azure Carter

at Millennium Film

66 East 4th Street
New York City

Saturday March 10th at 8:00

Telephone 212-673-0090 for more information.

"Since 1983 the amazingly prolific Alan Sondheim has appeared at Millenn- 
ium on a regular basis with substantial new works. This time the multi- 
talented media artist has come up with a highly erotic and controversial 
feature entitled CREPUSCLE (TWILIGHT) which stars the remarkable dancer, 
Foofwa d'Imobilite, along with Azure Carter and Alan Sondheim. The program 
will include several short pieces shot in Switzerland." (CREPUSCLE is a 
mutual production of the three of us. The program will most likely include 
one work, WAREQUIEM, shot in Second Life.) 

"CREPUSCLE (TWILIGHT) explores the exigencies of dance, eroticism, cultur- 
al constraint, and arousal; it was edited from over a dozen segments in 
Geneva. The work tenders the null-point of language, a point where words 
stutter, where the body takes over, stumbles, where cultural tropes are 
transformed and disappear. It's the deliberate recreation of repressed 
memories. It challenges the conventions of dance, turning dance inside- 
out, turning dance out. For the three of us, it's the culmination of an 
erotic element in our work that subtexts and disrupts the performative 
itself. CREPUSCLE rides the muscle of the body and jouissance, opening a 
territory which remains virtual, haunting." (A.S.)
