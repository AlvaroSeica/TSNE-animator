Carrying the Door with Bronze Strips Upon the Back





xi



We wander around and we say, What can we do with our past? Everywhere,

Our past is trained upon us. Everywhere, there are names of people 

We do not know and histories we do not know. 



At our feet, dust carries words in an unknown tongue, and we hear stories 

In the evening, which are hidden in the bright sun of noon, such stories 

As would tell us everything, return us to ourselves. 



But we wander around in our future, our eyes put out, our ears welded 

Shut to the storm of the present, and every event we have taught ourselves 

Is already lost and beyond us.

Now you have moved to this column incised in stone, and irrevocable time 

Which has come between the two, has been lost. What has occurred in the

Gap, abyss, what communications, what sayings, have been formed and lost

In the thin air? 



The planet shudders everywhere with tiny events, entities which call 

Themselves life, which to themselves are called,a s if speech were a 

Given, as though creation did not proceed, incised, "When skies above 

Were not yet named / Nor earth below pronounced By Name." 



Names cut into name, cut into earth, cut into skin and the scars 

Of the skin which are history which has tallied this and every other 

Permanence. The tally holds it open, into which years drop. 



In order for speech to begin, gaps close, stitched shut by ibid., op. cit,

Colophon. Doesn't that take us elsewhere, already forgetting telephone,

Email post, cuneiform, ipseity lost in overwhelming detail? There is no 

Conclusion to our translucency. Our _uncanniness,_ in these media, 

Fluttering and winged throughout the real, loses us, beyond the gesture 

Of speech, forgetting Shamhat, forgetting neither loss nor gain.
