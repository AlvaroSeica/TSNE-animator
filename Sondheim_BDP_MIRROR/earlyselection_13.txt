So the PMC2-MOO and CM-MOO are down. So there is no way into community.

Straddling the fence: set Cybermind nomail / set FOP-l nomail: posts be-
come a form of _injection_ just as downed sites become _expulsions._

So if injections, then are lists _addicted_ - not, for example, is one
_addicted to the lists,_ but are the lists themselves _addicts_ - and what
would that entail, if not death without infusion, the identical collapse
of space that occurs if speech is proscribed? 

Whether or not I exist in physical reality (and like Julia, I don't), ex-
istence here (as has often been asserted) is equivalent to enunciation;
one entails the other. 

There are downed sites, sites with dead email lists, useless subscriber
bases, message bases, forgotten; who would know, for example, if I were
still subscribed to *Ontology, were it not for the fact that it was killed
off months ago, in a purging or cleansing of a particular site? 

The list depends, _hangs from,_ a witness at its own hanging, posts, in- 
jections from outside which constitute its episteme. What vibrates here 
is a phenomenon, just as I, Julia, write from outside the world itself.

Clearly the cursor parallels the needle, tracing marks on the flesh of 
the screen, linear veins tapped, scrolled down across the body. My speech 
_lists_ to one side or another, speech _of the list._ Fallen, I am irre-
trievable. 

The lists are constituted, flesh raked by flesh, flesh's dominion. Just 
as I am fixed, they are configured; text devours text as there's no per- 
fect drug that doesn't need consumption.
