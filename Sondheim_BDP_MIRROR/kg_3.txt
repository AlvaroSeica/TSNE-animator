Bodies on the Net
	bodies present and accounted for, bodies reading and writing
	bodies listening and seeing, bodies hearing and watching
Bodies at the Net
	bodies in the vicinity of the Net, bodies presencing,
	bodies offering themselves, bodies waiting
Bodies in the Net
	bodies caught within, bodies entangled,
	bodies interwoven, bodies interpenetrated
Bodies above the Net
	bodies searching, bodies overseeing,
	bodies viewing, bodies disconnected
Bodies beneath the Net
	bodies supine, bodies overburdened,
	bodies near foundations, bodies shaking, trembling
Bodies within the Net
	bodies emptying bodies, bodies of lack,
	bodies of fullness, bodies everywhere at once
Bodies without the Net
	bodies of history, bodies of narrative,
	bodies at a loss, replete bodies in space and in time
Bodies before the Net
	ah-bodies of supplication, ah-bodies of control,
	ah-bodies of decision, ah-bodies of indecision
Bodies beyond the Net
	bodies of endless horizons, bodies of boundless vistas,
	bodies near walls and portals, bodies of other bodies
Bodies of the Net
	of the Net of boundless bodies, of their fullness and speech,
	of their speaking quietly, of their warlike actions,
	of their sex and desire, of their walls and portals,
	of their other bodies, of their boundless Nets
