WHAT YOU DID





I am a sick man, sleeping at odd hours, desperately cutting back on 

nourishment of all sorts, leaning myself towards hard times and pure

thought; I am a sick man, dreaming irruptions, bedsores, flesh pool-

ing itself into hallucinated images, creeping along the floorboards,

absorbing everything in its path. The floor is streaked with it, long

trails passing for memories. Writing has almost become unbearable...



But the dream I had was of a waif, short-hair, bruised face, curled

up in your arms naked, this waif, voicing to me that she had heard 

you, curled up within you, long long ago. And I uncurled, momentarily,

for the two of you, whispering that this was a key to the violence of

my life. Beyond the whisper, things fell, swollen. Beyond it, I could

hear the door shut, thick-lipped memory closing its violated mouth.



To awaken, thrashing the body apart, now bones oozing long white 

sheaths down the bedspread, between the cracks and knotholes on the

floor again. The floor whispered to me that it was my true home, that

I would live there as its covering, your feet digging themselves into

me, an eternity of bruises, spelling a shadow cancelling the residue

of a mawkish sun slitting me with its long thin beams. The memories

would shut forever, three thick paragraphs of text.
