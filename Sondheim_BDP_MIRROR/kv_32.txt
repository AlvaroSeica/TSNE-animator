the ancients, cool


the slightest change of angle, levered against the
 gnomon, reaches from the second to the kalpa
all into all, all maps into all
the glance of a second reveals the form of the 
 true stars, their design formless, beyond comprehension
nothing into nothing, nothing maps into nothing
