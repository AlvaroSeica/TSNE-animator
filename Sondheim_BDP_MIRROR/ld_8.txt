Match-Girl Time (Jennifer)


  Good and bad luck depend on money. It is a power in the _bourgeois_
period for this reason, that is only wooed on all hands like a girl,
indissolubly wedded by nobody. All the romance and chivalry of _wooing_
for a dear object come to life again in competition. Money, an object of
longing, is carried off by the bold "knights of industry."

  He who has luck takes home the bride. The ragamuffin has luck; he takes
her into his household, "society," and destroys the virgin. In his house
she is no longer bride, but wife; and with her virginity her family name
is also lost. As housewife the maiden Money is called "Labor," for "Labor"
is her husband's name. She is a possession of her husband's.

  To bring this figure to an end, the child of Labor and Money is again a
girl, an unwedded one and therefore Money, but with the certain descent
from Labor, her father. The form of the face, the "effigy," bears another
stamp.

(Max Stirner, The Ego and His Own)


  Who could not want to see my tiny naked limbs through my torn ragamuffin
dress? What a delight it would be to sell myself a destroyed virgin, for
any Man who would take me! More than anything, I want to be possessed,
these poor rags ripped from my girl's pubescent body, to the delight of
the bourgeois, both male and female! To display myself and gain income at
once is my fondest ambition; I am yours for the Labor and Lucre.

(Jennifer, Who Belongs to You)
