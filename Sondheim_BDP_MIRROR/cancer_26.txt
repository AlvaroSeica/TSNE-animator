 home

 you may decide to visit your homeland, you may try and read the code. you
 may type nervously, there are beautiful clouds in the sky, pink-yellow,
 scudding into darkness upwelling. you know how little you understand, what
 you do and how you do it. you may decide to open your mouth, your mouth
 takes in all languages of the world, you may decide to close it, you may
 hear yourself, you may hear yourself speaking, how little you understand,
 chop($that=<stdin>);=~ tr/aeiou/$alphabet($alpha)/;print "\nthis $that
 speeds endlessly through the body - \n";t "your $nnn[$nnnn] is the curr-
 ency of my drug - \n"; sleep(1);print "ah...\n";print "\nyour bones are my
 $nnn[$non1]? \n";chop($str=<stdin>);($str eq "no") {print "\nshow me my
 body, show me my wetware...\n"; sleep(10); gotolse {print "\ni love your
 feelings, $that ...\n";}, you may find yourself loving nothing, you may
 write this as a note to yourself, you may think to yourself, there is
 little else in this world, there is nothing in these and other worlds, you
 may look at yourself with a microscope and an x-ray, you may examine your-
 self with an mrs and an eeg. and you may translate images, you may trans-
 late pages of writing, you may see your molecules with your own eyes in
 the comfort of your study. and you may sleep a long sleep, you may live in
 your bones, you may change into your drugs, you may swallow yourself, you
 may inject yourself,

 and then you may find yourself, you may find yourself visiting your home-
 land, you may live within the comfort zone, you may find yourself home.
