You're already home!
look
la daraine
There's sadness in the forest if you've reached this part. You forget
how to speak - you're desperate to speak. The brook runs close by, green-
gold carp fluxed within it, shimmers of lozenge-suns against marbled
leaf-shadows. A perfect radio plays a perfect tune. This is before the
noise or this is the noise. The tune is lightning everywhere radiation
everywhere, but subtle. The aventure is in the listening here, hands
fluttering above the keyboard. You don't need to see to read, anymore.

You say, "my name is Alan."

You say, "i'm all alone here."

You say, "this is my space."

You say, "i span it from one end to the other, across the margins, across
 the lines themselves"

laugh
Alan laughs like crazy!

You say, "I can jump but I don't remember how."

jump
I don't understand that.

You say, "I don't understand what I don't understand."
You say, "This is my space."

look
Kyoto
an intense clearing, city-basin, distant humans, everywhere visible...
You see snow, Luminous Sign, and the City of Wind here.
