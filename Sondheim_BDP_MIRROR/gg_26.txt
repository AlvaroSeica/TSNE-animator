Extraction. Mourning.


For the dark nights ahead, for Jon Marshall, and reading Celan.

I have sent out, repeatedly, Michael Current's last post - the story,
received the day before he died; it will also be part of the Lusitania
book, dedicated to him. And I've kept the story, as I've said repeat-
edly, in my Inbox, from 1994 until and through now. But I have never
_excavated_ before, extracted the full header, the memorial of message
identifications, to share with you, an uncanny exhumation. For the full
header to me is sadder, in many ways, than the texts, the story, the eul-
ogies, the condolences. It's sadder, because it's mute, as our own deaths
are. It speaks across technologies, almost older than civilization in
2096, and it's lost in the sky, lost in the ground, like every other name
and number.

Sending the full header is another form of dissemination; we, it, are so
very fragile. But you won't remember this, and the you is always already
someone else.

(For those who have recently joined these lists, Michael Current and I be-
gan Cybermind at the end of May, 1994; I began Fop-l a few weeks later.
Then Michael died; he was 31.)


Note the new first line, added as the header was saved:
