You see, differance is a file or array; you see, it's not the subtle wisp
of cloud caressing the moon, gone before your aware-ness (mono no aware)
catches up with you... Nikuko would write the difference with the edge of
the brush; back erect, shodo following breath upon the horizontal page.
But here, she'd say, were she next to me, hands on shoulder, lips lightly
brushing the erect back, it's a question or answer of five strings, well-
defined, pure information which only happens to appear in this or that
font, of this or that size, bold or italic or underline, or any other de-
fault setting the subject might predispose herself to reading within. She,
subject-Nikuko, turns back to the brush. Kanji is not always a question or
problem of difference, however subtle; it is also a memory. Isn't every
alphabet. Only to the extent that bandwidth reduces to the twenty-six, and
then further to the two, harbored against the one. Always coherent, the
two, Nikuko said; it's literally bound that way. One swallows the other.
Moon, fogging.
