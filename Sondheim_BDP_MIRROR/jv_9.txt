The kill and shutdown commands fascinate me; the latter leaves a trail
behind it, as the system comes to a halt; it appears like the slow ex-
piration of a beast; finally _system halted_ appears; the creature is dead
in its tracks... 

Amazing that an operating system - so much - appears like _mind_ ...
