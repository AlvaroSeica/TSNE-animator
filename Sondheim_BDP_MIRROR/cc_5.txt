Kyberspace: You didn't read this here:


"I insist that words are totally absent from my mind when I really think
and I shall completely align my case with Galton's in the sense that even
after reading or hearing a question, every word disappears at the very
moment I am beginning to think it over; words to not reappear in my con-
sciousness before I have accomplished or given up the research, just as
happened to Galton; and I fully agree with Schopenhauer when he writes,
'Thoughts die the moment they are embodied by words.'" (From Jacques Ha- 
damard, The Psychology of Invention in the Mathematical Field.)

Come _to think of it,_ in the writing of this, the ideas formed function- 
ally before their production against the writing of this, _frisson_ to be 
sure, as if I had succeeded in conveying something to you? Does _differ- 
ance_ return to difference, absolute or nearly decomposable? The left ear 
does not know what the right eye does.

I've been _following_ these determinations, remaining behind, slouched be-
neath the streetlight on the corner - you can look out, see me from your 
second-story window...
