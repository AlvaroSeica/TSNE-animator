WRITING ON AMERICA


I'm getting a big Chevy New Yorker, 1973, tan with beige linings, and I'm
putting in a drag plate understructure - I'm going to rig the plate with
paint sprayers, 64 across - they run from the tanks of white acrylic dry-
fast in the trunk - there's heat nozzles too - make sure nothing's left
damp as the car heads down the nighttime highway in the middle of the
night. there's a computer, too - old Pentium 100, tied to the sprayers -
there's a program running - I just enter the words I want out - the prog-
ram adjusts for the car speed - words appear good and hard on the pave-
ment - they're ready-to-read - there are a couple of fonts as well - the
whole thing can work from 0 to 55 miles an hour - it starts to blur after
that - I'm on the way north from Lafayette Indiana - I spray YOU PUT YOUR
BIG DICK IN MY HUNGRY HOLE - it's about a quarter-mile in length - next
day on the news - I'm out of there - down through Dallas, Texas, right on
the way to Fort Worth - there's a trucker on my right, bearing down - I've
got to be careful - I SWALLOW YOUR COCK AND DRINK YOUR HEAVY CUM - appears
under the car - just like that - the program's perfect - it's the same
thing I sprayed in the Lincoln Tunnel, New Jersey to New York City right-
hand lane - that made the news as well - had to get out of town - the
Chrysler spotted - outside Albuquerque - _that_ was a ride - heavy on the
gas all those altitudes - nice yellow-white touch in the tanks - AMERICA I
WANNA BE YOUR GREEDY HOLE = FUCK ME IN MY MOUTH - even the equal sign was
clear - I was going 45, almost got knocked out by a minivan - so I do go
all over America - just like that - go everywhere I want - WORDS WORDS
WORDS between Seattle and Bellingham - MY COCK IS ALWAYS HUNGRY FOR YOUR
CUNT - awkward sentence between Providence and Fall River - do a country
road or two as well - DON'T TELL ANYONE - or LOVE ME TIL THE COWS COME
HOME - so I'm WRITING ON AMERICA - WORDS ON THE ROAD - so I'm LEAVING MY
MARK - so I'm LEAVING MY TRACE - wherever you are YOU'LL BE READING ME -
I'M HOT AND HORNY AND I WANT _YOU_ - and YOU'RE HOT AND HORNY AND YOU WANT
_ME_ - outside of Omaha - near the Strategic Air Command Museum - those
tiny roads - keep a lookout - I'm moving on - listen to the news - Scran-
ton Pennsylvania - LISTEN TO THE NEWS -
