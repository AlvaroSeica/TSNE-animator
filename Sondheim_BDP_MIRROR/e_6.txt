About Depressing About Reading About Death


We toss and turn, move and cancellation death from our eyes, our mouths 
huffing the words, going on thusly forever until the final bleak and 
bureaucratic moment when someone else takes over.

With the lid of an eye the universe swelters for the last time, the gaze 
killing off the cloud gathered around the body looking for a soul.

More often than not we regale ourselves in the manufacture of lurid 
exploits of others, always others who are there, unhappening to 
ourselves, beyond which we can never venture.

So to beware the index which accompanies death, the index in the 
singular, for a moment imagine the plural of the world collapsed and 
inhaling. 

As if the death-row packets or winking of the wires churned haze into 
obsequious followers of the real dirt fulfilling mouths' desires to stop 
once and for all, turn transformed into our mouths, I for one, I for one 
will never hear the end of it.
