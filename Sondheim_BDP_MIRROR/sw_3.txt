uncanny





one, two

http://www.alansondheim.org/cave027.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/comeforyou.mp3

one has two things: an interval and an event.
one bears witness, one dies.
to have engulfed the witness, the interval, to be engulfed.
one can do nothing with one's death.
one has nothing to do with one's death.



Proving

The qin's difficult; sometimes I have to prove to myself,
after hating what I've done, misshapen, out of tune, 
grotesque, but not in a way I want - that I can still 
play the instrument, that with the proper concentration,
things will work out, more or less, and this small corner
of the world will feel inhabited once again. Here there
are two qin pieces, one (proving) using hands and arms in
the usual position, but moving quickly through difficult
improvisation, and the other (proving) with cross-arm
movement, playing in reverse in other words. Ah, so here
are two pieces working in my favor. The Lombok image is
a topographic map of the homeland my gambus, perhaps 
more on that later.

simultaneous teething, liminal image in 
 liminal space 




silence of guqin

the guqin as an ecosystem, biome; each of the seven strings 
meanders along its own channels, each changes character along 
its length, from bridge to bridge, above the waters, sky, earth, 
each has its own silence, i would capture that, meander, with
the sounding of a single note, dying-out, lowered or raised, 
just that, the arch of the string, arcing, a field beneath the 
strings, above the curvature of the sky, always the entirety 
under tension, always the entirety in resonance, collectivity, 
among which the note, singularity, is sounded, dying out, there 
is no memory, there is no tune that encompasses, no image here, 
i would assign an image, it disappears, vanishes, i live among 
wood, wood and weather, the subtle vibrations of the floor, in 
the midst of the slow steady rain, my arms move from one to the 
other end, from one to the other, athletic, an encompassing, or 
compass, designation among the seven, the duplicates, the five, 
the thirteen, the positions, the sliding among or into the 
positions, approaching the positions, so much memory, i will do 
this, will play to the limit on the right, encompassing the 
right, until sound leaves, broken, tuneless, out of tune, unable 
to hold forth, the position so clear in the middle, in the 
midst, where the sky divides into two, the left, musculature, 
reach of the arm, the right, approaching infinity up to the 
bridge, as if there were a crossing, the pool or pond, infinite 
octaves, bent, distorted, leaving the one note behind, open to 
emptying space, multiple universes, multiverses, each duplicate 
of each, ranging differently, different qualities and weathers, 
the weather of the wood, of the silk and metal, the weather of 
the water, air and earth, the fire of the weather, tending the 
wood among the elements, the wood breathing in the midst of 
other lives, the wood expelling, the breath ceasing, i would 
summon spirits, i would play among them in the hollows, cavity 
of the guqin, i would circulate among the passages, hide against 
the corrosion and deceit of the weather, my hands flee from the 
energy of the extremes, in the middle they find recompense, find 
redemption, the ordering righting in the midst of unknown 
climate, the ordering quietly in procession, here in the middle 
of the night, the strings among themselves sounding within me, 
or am i wood or weather, or am i element or expulsion, what of 
the spirit, surely they, among so many others, the room sounding 
the guqin among, there the ceiling, the wall or a shadow of 
sound or tone shadow sounding, i am clearing, clearing above the 
pools, above the sky and earth, cosmos, clearing and my arms, 
hands, moving, and there among them, and to the left, what clear 
depths and clarity, and to the right, those infinite intervals 
decreasing in length and speed, in movement and speech, those 
intervals increasing in tone and pitch, i can no longer hear 
them, so much pressure on the strings, the clearing stretches 
infinitely before me, there are trees and lines of trees, there 
are people singing, all the animals are there, all the plants as 
well, soft showers and peaceable kingdoms, and the retreat and 
expansion of the single note, all of this, this song i am 
singing, this tone underway, this image almost visible, this 
tune of goodness and kindness, this ballad of no death, this 
pillar of the single note, this mountain hut, this wood old 
beyond belief, i am of the wood, i am singing, this spirit of 
wood and metal, fire and earth and air, surely they



Dinosaur Footprint on La Quinta Inn Chair

http://www.alansondheim.org/dinosaur.mp3

accompanied by overly quiet shakuhachi in
La Quinta Inn

structure: I meditate on the weight of a
small dinosaur in a silted lakebed in the
Pioneer Valley, Mass. I meditate on the
ratio of the time taken to make the
impression and the time since then. I
think about the compression of my own 
body against the chair, playing shakuhachi.
I meditate on forms of life and the comfort
of lifeforms and familiarity with the 
world. I meditate on the world. I persist.

2 reviews of Cutting Board 

http://www.alansondheim.org/5004.jpg
http://espdisk.com/official/catalog/5004.html

From the November issue of The Wire (which used 2 like me):

Alan Sondheim with Christopher Diasparra and Edward Schneider
Cutting Board ESP-Disk CD

Since its reactivation in 2005, ESP-Disk has maintained a steady 
trickle of reissues of epochal free jazz albums, archival finds 
and even some new music by Talibam!, Joe Morris and others. But 
multi-instrumentalist Alan Sondheim is the first artist from the 
roster of ESP-Disks 196475 golden era to record new material for 
the label. It makes perfect sense too: nearly half a century 
later, his sound and aesthetic seem remarkably unchanged. Its at 
least partly because he has never tried or wanted to play jazz, 
positing instead a rough and prescient form of free 
improvisation.

Sondheims first album, subsequently included on the Nurse With 
Wound list, was 1967s The Songs, featuring a single, raggedly 
theatrical performance by Ritual All 70 a group of young 
improvisors living in a communal loft in Providence, Rhode 
Island. More or less the same group, recording under Sondheims 
name only, created his two ESP-Disk releases. Ritual-All-7-70, 
also recorded in 1967, sounds exactly like a gang of stoned 
students plonking around on bongos and tabla, but Sondheims 
intuitive explorations on guitars, sax, clarinet, koto and horn 
tap into the kind of no-technique, non-idiomatic improvisation 
that can be heard in countless 21st century DIY dungeons on 
either side of the Atlantic.

This new material finds Sondheim again approaching a wide array 
of instruments, with an emphasis on the exotic including Chinese 
mouth harp, saz, sarangi, ghichak, cura, tro so, sung lisu and 
many more all played with the same exuberant, non-virtuoso 
relish. On Xenon something is bowed with raw, savage 
stridulations. On Argon something is strummed messily in a 
vaguely Arabic mode. And so on. Hes accompanied by saxophonists 
Diasparra (on tenor and baritone) and Schneider (on alto), who, 
at best, help to guide and shape Sondheims brief bursts and, at 
worst, sound a little lost and flailing around for a hook to 
cling to. Theres no pretence of the communal vibe that 
characterised the 60s recordings its clearly Sondheims session. 
But, with so many instruments to play and such a lot of fun to 
be had, who needs company? Daniel Spicer

Alan Sondheim with Christopher Diasparra & Edward Schneider, 
Cutting Board

Alan Sondheim came to our ears years ago principally on the two 
albums he did for ESP, Ritual-All-7-70 and T'Other Little Tune, 
issued in 1967 and 1968, respectively. I came to him a little 
later through these albums, which impressed me as 
uncompromisingly home-made in their DIY experimental avant 
improvisatory thrust. On them Sondheim played guitar and a 
battery of other instruments, neither evoking jazz or new music 
syntax but rather forging his own vocabulary that reached out to 
world musics but only obliquely so.

Much time has passed and apparently also a number of releases 
came out that I have not heard as yet. He returns to the ESP 
fold with a new recording Cutting Board (ESP 5004). On it 
Sondheim matches sonic textures with Christopher Diasparra on 
tenor and baritone saxes, and Edward Schneider on the alto sax. 
Sondheim plays a wealth of instruments, from chromatic 
harmonica, sarangi, classical guitar and flute to electric saz 
and ukulele. As always Alan's playing is about sound and 
texture, not as much typical linear technique.

The totality of the album hangs together as experimental free 
improv more than free jazz per se, though Schneider and 
Diasparra give out phrasings more akin to post-new-thing sax 
expressions than not.

As is always the case with Sondheim, the music suits your ears 
best when you wipe your listening mind of expectations. This 
music has little in common with JATP, standards, or even 
ensemble avant jazz and new music as they come to us today. It 
is Sondheim music and for that it is very good. It is musical 
sound as art. So go ahead and listen.
