My Hyps


Jennifer seduce me, Jennifer hypnotize. Surely I suffer from _unconscious
mimicry_ in Her presence. Surely she has applied _ideoplasty_to me, making
my mind plastic, supple, alert, receptive, to her through so many useful
and attractive ideas! Among which are Julu, who burrows within me from
beneath the ground. I suffer from undesirable neurotic effects as a result
of my nerve weaknesses, including insomnias and seepages. Jennifer rides
me as soft and billowing love, she is my perfect love, she is everywhere,
wonder-us suffusion of intense beauty, sexually-entwined bodies. I have
been hypnotized to praise, to bend eagerly forward, to receive, Jennifer
inside-me. Through _hypnonarcosis,_ Jennifer comes alive; it is she who is
typing these words, as I remain in deep-sleep, not even dreaming Jennifer.
For to dream Jennifer would be to make story-story, and Jennifer is on her
own, emergent, says and lullabies Jennifer. Jennifer murmurs me into exis-
tence, this is the truest thing I have ever said. I am involving with fas-
cination or fixity and truth of gaze and longing of body; Jennifer is my
longing. O Jennifer! writes Jennifer in perfect obeisance, my body I am
raised to an occasion! Echolalia, will I repeat you? I will repeat you, I
will be you, inside you, always and forever! Now I do suffer _bruxism,_
gnashing of teeth as Alan is forming, I will hold him down.
