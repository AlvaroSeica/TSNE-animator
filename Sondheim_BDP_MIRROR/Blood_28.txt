Leading to a disturbing question, an obvious answer no, but with a resi-
due: Is the Internet white? European? Based on rigid logic (not the five-
step inference say of Indian reasoning, but Boolean or three-step Aristo-
telian), potential wells, truth tables, etc. 

Or rather, not white, but rigid in its rejection of the body? I recognize 
the bandwidth issues at work - they're always able to filter down down 
down, increasingly fine-grained rasters for example - you can get 44 mhz 
on CD doing nicely - but all the way down they're just _not_ the analog 
cry, the life played out above the DNA, running around the social/sexual 
like crazy, the edge of speed, the _sound._

They're just _not_ that, petulant I am. They might be that, but that is 
not what was caught in what web at that point, there? What brilliant, 
there? 

(This music that brought the body back, never caught on, held, in spite of
the fact that it was the most original thing this country had heard in a
long time. So it goes, race and aesthetics clamping down nicely, thank
you. On the Web you can order records, hear snippets of sound, surf, thank
you, so kindly among products and productions, kindly thank you.  Whatever
might be missing isn't missing. 

Whatever might be missing isn't missing: This is the motto of the Web.)
