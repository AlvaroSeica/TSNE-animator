_mouthing_


sinking into my hysteric ugliness, flesh conjoins with flesh measured 
with scissors laundering the body's interior. a _mouthing_ operation
stitches lips apart, gagging on the interminable cluster of sounds
swallowing air, pretty pebbles before me but they are glass

what is torn from its roots loses the powers of reproduction; sap 
glistens at every opening, here, let me show you. unattended, my mind
snaps, crashing against the melodrama of rna scurrying to complete the
task. the wave collapses into chaos, catastrophe, words blunted by
concentration mathematics. 

i need to believe that the straight line never parts.
i need to believe that a circle, no matter how large, returns
into the fold.
i need to believe that the book does not open peacefully, but splays
itself, and that my body is absolved through its presence there.
mouthing, i need to believe in presence beyond the sorrow of a program, 
home: print "wail wail": goto home. 
working, asleep, home: "home: print `wail wail': goto home": goto home.
i would name myself without the number of names, in this night of
sutured mouths.

speech is precious when there are pretty pebbles, my cock is a pretty
penny, my skin a paper book.
did i mention the pretty pebbles are optional? 
in monochrome the thing dissolves, but you have options and are not
optional. i have been mouthed.
