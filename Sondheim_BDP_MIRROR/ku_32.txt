emptied identities poured into shells around suns, around planets:
holes burned through my jumper, serrated edges of charred threads:
and wires: active, and on fire, limbs burned and being: limbs burning:
hungers and satiations: hungers and serrations:
your wandering equivalences and identities are in my
equivalences, knitted jumpers, identities and knitting needles:
oh devour wandering equivalences and identities, burning jumpers,
charred petticoats and slips turned to delicate ash and needles:
emptied identities poured into shells around suns around planets!
