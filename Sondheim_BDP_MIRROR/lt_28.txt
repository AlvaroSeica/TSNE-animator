today i'm making asteroids, objects convoluted by enormous tidal 
    distortions, camera gliding tight above the surface, occasionally
    intersecting planes, moving from exterior to interior, anomalous
    spaces; series of dream-images, floaters, occurrences behind
the mind's intended focus; colors shift; the thing-in-itself turns
    towards and across phenomena of pure representation; such
    asteroids are residues; skins the thickness of a single pixel;
	they're nothing but organization; they are conceived as the
	totality of organization; they behave as if seeping across 
    illimitable spaces; they flow through darkness with nothing but 
    local geodesics; it's as if intentionality retreated to a form of
purity as such; nothing of solipsism, but of neighborhood; they're a 
kind of neighborhood; they stress the local; there's nothing else
    available or at hand; there are asteroid textures; thin cotton
    panties stretched between labia; the body swelling against the
geodesics; pulled taut across them; desire flows locally; it's a form
    of dyadic mathesis; it's the absorption of x*0 = 0; it's the 
    supplement of x+0 = x; it's the absorption of x*1 = x; it's 
	waiting for the 1; it's waiting for x+1 = x'; it's waiting
	to break out; it's waiting to leave the dream; it's waiting
    for detumescence; it's waiting for decathexis; it's the disin-
    vestment of surface; skins of images of cloth hiding skins of 
    images; it's the retreat of asteroids in the face of awakening;
the intersection planes, the perfect control, floaters, the loss of
    control; x';



death haiku


dying, i'll settle for
    nothing less than screaming

    pull me away from there
i'll thank you in eternity

    you can tell i'm not going
nails broken 
clawing the ground

don't wait for me to return
    turn around yourself
    i'm at your back

    death hurts and last words
don't mean a thing

i've remembered all
    the important things in life

    dignity in dying is obscene
dignity in death lies to the living

i'll yell so loud
    you'll all be really sorry

nothing memorable comes from death
    nothing memorable from dying

my belongings aren't my own
    your belongings aren't your own

only matter matters
    beginning and end of substance

    death always hurts
worse than anything

knowing death is living in it
    you can't possibly mean anything

whatever i said
    i meant it
