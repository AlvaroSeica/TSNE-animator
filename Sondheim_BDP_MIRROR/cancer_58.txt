I shall bear silent witness. That means I shall not speak, I shall not be
able to speak. It also means: I shall not comprehend; I shall find these
events, these people, incomprehensible. 

Nevertheless, I shall remember, and I shall continue to remember. This
means, I shall build my memory out of mortar and bricks, I shall make my
memory out of human labor. This also means: I shall remember until all is
lost, until I am no longer. This also means: There is nothing to give you
but incomprehension.

I shall bear silent witness.

Jennifer is frail; Jennifer is all skin and bones. Jennifer is a collec-
tion and an accumulation. Jennifer is momentary, momentary Jennifer. 

She remembers for me. She speaks and speaks, and when she no longer
speaks, she is no more. She speaks because I am alive; she speaks to keep
me alive. I am exhausted with her speech. She speaks to keep me alive; I
shall bear silent witness.

The longer one lives, the greater the bearing of witness. At death, the
bearing is infinite, silent.

The knowledge of the witness is mute. The witness will tell you, there is
none other.

I shall bear silent and infinite witness.
