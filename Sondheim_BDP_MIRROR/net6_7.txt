HEART OF DARKNESS: The Disquiet Body of Electronic Communication







Disquiet \ the square in the deserted village

	 \ the square in the busy city

	 \ in the middle of the night

	 \ lurking on the conference, breathing down a back





_I am speaking with a stranger._ an ominous beginning, the spy coming

in from the cold, the lurker who hides in the shadows - someone, an

intimacy which occurs as the whisper of voices in the dark



(Am I the lurker? Am I being watched? My fear is everywhere, the fear

of an impossible intimacy, blocked voyeur, exhibitionist, my voice

drowned silently in the wires.)



_I imagine your body_ your face, everything hidden beneath your 

clothes, the picture of smooth skin dark or light, toy-like genitals, 

the hat pulled down over your eyes, smoke rising against the 

streetlamp, fog, rain - I would - (I would do nothing, modest and

awkward in your vicinity.)



What do you want? I say. What do you want? (You say you're lonely, you

want love. You say you're looking for an SO, significant other. I

tremble, want so much to please you. I tremble, naked, before the

screen.)



_I would tell you everything,_ spread my legs for you - for you I have 

no secrets, my mouth, my ass are open, wide cunt, hard cock - (You can

write this, sexless, of every sex, every _preposition_.) (You can have

me, have my love.)



(The cunt or cock, that's not it at all. It is the _frisson_ or

murmur of acceptance, the pleasure of communal being, lost in ASCII

_space_ or talk.romance.chat.)



Or just the pleasure of the _voice,_ its grain, it reads itself to me, 

_disquietude_... (There is no voice, we remind each other: _there is

no voice._)



:A disquiet withdrawn, always already overlooked, a disquiet or

interference, the threat to bring the structure DOWN, collapse 

occurring alone, in isolation. There are a million rooms across the

planet filled with my images of you, corresponding, writing _to me_,

moment close to the dream screen itself, but its inversion: retreat 

from the symbolic to the imaginary.[1]



(I write to you; you treat each post as potential romance and I am

bound to _disappoint._)



This is a delicate manifold or _web inversion_ [2], near collapse, the 

body in quick retreat, detumescence, the loss of faith, hope, charity.

Net communication skims on a fetishized reflecting surface like the 

skin of a new car; the discomfort is the real.



(I didn't mean it, I say. You misunderstood my words, I add. I never

even thought you would think like this, you say. You add, we should

stop before damage is done.)



_You can feel the discomfort approaching. Your correspondence becomes

voluminous; you dream the Name, say it dangerously to yourself, over

and over again. [3] You can feel it; the response, once playful, 

takes on a harder edge, full of decodings. Neurosis appears within 

the grand design; the writing itself veers, unredeemed, from one side 

to another, careers across the inscribed trajectories and etiquette of

the superego. This is the seepage of the imaginary, the hallucin-

ogenic character of the communication, beginning to open, the crack

in the door, crack in the body.



If the Net begins as symbolic communication, the subject inscribes

herself/himself within it; address, recognition, and protocol charac-

terize the subject who is produced/constructed as a state of 

continuous REWRITE. [4] Inscription itself is based on a classical two-

valued logic with distributivity. Within the sememe, gestural logics

take over as well - logics without distributivity in which individua-

ted elements are capable of generating greater bandwidths than the

distance/distinction/differance between them. [5] When the subject

_fissures,_ collapses near disjunction, the sememe degenerates into

partial logics, incoherencies, and fragments; the Kristevan _Thing_ 

(*Black Sun*) - inert and obdurate - appears. The communication is

simultaneously out of control and muffled/drowsy, a state of

(addictive) withdrawal. [6]



There is a double parallel (double, because of internal reflections) 

here with the fetishization of commodity in late capitalism, and 

sexual pornography; both regimes imply a continuous reinscribing of

the self through chains of commands (_pipelining_) as well as a

detumescence/aphanisis [7] of affect: _specific_ objects (last year's

computer, last month's "playmate") become (psychoanalytically) used 

up, discarded. This _using up_ is _critical_ to the comprehension 

of Internet and other electronic ASCII/Image communication, just 

as it is critical to an understanding of the devouring-machine of 

capital.



Orgasm wastes the pornographic image; turning-away or face-to-face

wastes the Net correspondent; time wastes everything. This

devouring is a decathexis returned to the fetishistic/shamanic of

the paleolithic in which an object is used to "carry" the disease

from the patient, an object/abject of loss. [8]



All objects are objects of loss. 



All objects carry within them the horizon of discard, retreat within

the face of death. The face of death burns itself from the wires into

the face of the correspondent or user. The face of death writes/

rewrites the user, the _uncanny_ face of death. Abject: no place to

go, no origin to come from.



The user is always in a position of disquiet. I correspond with Susan

and I correspond with Keith, correspond with Karen and correspond...

I imagine their faces close to mine, double moons, impossible skin, 

soft reading of the world across their eyes. I imagine the body's

infolding, the exalted rapture of flesh within the sweet/complete 

surround of flesh, my broken body within, contained and rearranging, 

the seat of consciousness returning to pure liquidity.



"Susan," I begin. "Would you like to meet face-to-face, or is this

just a _terminal relationship?_  :) " I add the smiley to appear suave,

more human, a level of seriousness underlying the potential cauteriza-

tion. "I've been dying to meet you. I try to picture you, but without

much luck. I'm not even sure whether you're involved with someone, 

even want to be."



" I'm

" I'm

" I'm



This is the phenomenological horizon of correspondence, the eidetic

reduction, which reaches to the fluidity of the imaginary, beyond 

which the body violates itself, death seeps in, the terminal cools to

writing degree zero, and ECHO is toggled off. [9]
