World

Given the world, there are so many places I could have been born into.
I could have always been born otherwise than I am, unknowingly.
I would be as I am today, unknown as of others, spaces and times.
There would perhaps have been this wondering, or perhaps not.
That I am the one to wonder this or that, situates me at the pivot of
the world.
I am the world that wonders, that worlds as it wonders.
But there is no reason, given the world, I could not have been born 
there, instead of here, and even, in fact, there and there, a several.
We would have been the seasons or the cardinal directions, split into
poles before the world learned that there are hardly any.
If I walk north or south, burrow into the earth, fly, I will not meet
any of my other selves.
If I return naked in time, or prolong, vested, in future generations,
I will be utterly absent; thin threads of saliva alone will connect me
with some of you, perhaps reading this or perhaps not.
Given the world, I am not situated, however, here and now as well.
Whatever space I am given, I have abandoned, out of will or necessity,
or because my nature, being born, is that of abandonment.
Given the world, who has given this presence, or perhaps not. 
I could not have wondered, not have pondered.
I could not have dreamed, not have nightmared.
I could not have exalted, not have feared.
I could not have written, not have sacrificed.
I could not have been, or perhaps not.
I would be as I am today, unknown as of others, spaces and times.
