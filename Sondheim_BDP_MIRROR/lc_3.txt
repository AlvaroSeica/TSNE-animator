nikuko, sorted

could ever turn back, empty sake bottle on the table, she crawled across
dark temples on the other side, black nighttime roof-tops, eaves desper-
ately turned towards the sky, her time of working, world swallowed dreams,
too much caffeine, too many disagreements, her concentration dull machin-
ery in the back of the mind, a whirlwind or a wheel; nikuko woke up, her
wonder gone, the neon reflected in the river, dull glows across, her work
would be completed, you're always organizing me, she thought, month, year,
there was always a future of the lost, of that dark night nikuko woke up
writing at the prompt, writing in trance, knowledge not enough sleep. she
had trouble concentrating, the result of bad of her hand, something gnawed
at the periphery, it as a future without her, off; nikuko woke up, her
room looked too small even for nakasukawabata, she realized, a future
without her, coloring the rest of her morning, day, sorted at the other
end, as soon as she was done. she looked haggard, that corrections were
impossible, that the text would be impossibly the prompt heavy on the
screen, she wasn't used to this, no presence the tatami, something had
spilled, and wondering about the dawn when with the sorted future: this
would be gone, replaced by the other, nothing without promise of the dawn,
she turned over on the tatami and cried and cried and cried
