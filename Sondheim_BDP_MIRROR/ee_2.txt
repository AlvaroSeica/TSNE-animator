Confluence around these differing orders -


All of the below are intertwined; since I'm not a mathematical physicist,
_how_ exactly is beyond me. One of the ideas drawn from Bailey is that
what he calls intermaths need not _necessarily_ be reduced to steering
equations, i.e. universal and governing physical law. This is related to
notions of synergy, and artifacts produced from bottom-up parallel pro-
cessing - i.e. even simple one-dimensional artificial life forms. So there
are two movements at work in this period that can be considered postmod-
ern: the first is a classical physics, including statistical approaches,
which reifies physical law; the second emphasizes heuristics and massive
parallel processing - and that there need not be universal governing equa-
tions. The genetic descriptions of Dawson are intermediary, as is the work
of Dennett on consciousness. 

It's difficult to see where traditional philosophy of mathematics fits in 
here, but I imagine it moving towards heuristics and conventionalism, in 
spite of ontological confusion between, say, a particle and its defining 
constants. (My own thinking tends towards neo-platonism in the small.)

Do I know what I'm talking about? No. And it's Saturday afternoon.
