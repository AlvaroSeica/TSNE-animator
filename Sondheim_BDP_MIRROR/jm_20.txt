iiii P of I


I use a weather forecasting service provided for shell accounts through
telnet 3000. The end of the NY state weather forecast is below; this came
through the wire today. I quote it verbatim.

Note the word "tongue." It has not been present before in these texts. It
stands alone, trembling, at the end of the file, immediately before the
"for use" statement which I have eliminated.

It is a signal; certainly it is a signal, sent out this Wednesday morning,
Jan 29 03:25:07 EST 1997. Atmospheric traumas suddenly reformulate, pene-
trate, biology, organ. Gaia announces herself, defending the planet ag-
ainst the all-too-obvious conclusions of the phenomenology of immensity,
which I have taken pains to delineate.

Tongue, it, literally, says, it, all.
