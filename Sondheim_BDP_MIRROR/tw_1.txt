Another Great Review of Threnody!

From Vital Weekly: 

"ALAN SONDHEIM & AZURE CARTER & LUKE DAMROSCH 
THRENODY (SHORTER DISCOURSES OF THE BUDDHA)  
(CD by Public Eyesore)

"Reading the name of Alan Sondheim I had to think of old 
ESP-releases from the 60s. Are we dealing with the same person 
here? Yes we are! Sondheim is a Brooklyn-based multidisciplinary 
artist, musician, writer- philosopher, and performer. Virtuality 
is his main theme in many of his works I read. For his work as a 
recordings musician we have to make a big jump from his 60s 
releases for ESP into 21st century, to find new releases. Music 
is not his main thing, I suppose. However in the last few years 
he made several recordings with his partner Azure Carter. This 
resulted in Cauldron(2011) together with Helen Espvall. And in 
2014 Avatar Woman saw the light. This makes Threnody in 
collaboration with Luke Damrosch, the third statement. Sondheim 
plays a wide range of instruments:  alto clarinet, Bb clarinet, 
alto recorder, Irish banjo, alpine zither, viola, cura saz, 
electric guitar, di Giorgio classical guitar, qin, chromatic 
harmonica, electric saz, long-necked saz, oud, pipa, shakuhachi, 
madal, erhu and dan moi. Damrosch plays guzheng, madal, revrev 
supercollider software. Carter sings. Together they deliver an 
overwhelming and mind blowing work, consisting of 24 songs and 
improvisations. If only by the different sounds and timbres of 
all these instruments. But there is a lot more here. The music 
often sounds like blues or folk music, but from a totally other 
planet. Its improvised microtonal music. Very much alive and 
emotional on the one hand, but also of very a abstract and 
imaginary nature. A perfect combination if you ask me. Very 
weird are the tracks where Carter sings a melody over the 
improvisations of Sondheim and Damrosch like in the opening 
track Comeforme of Bone. Sondheim creates a very idiosyncratic, 
one of a kind, musical universe. A deep bow! (DM)"

Our cat Ossi Oswalda died, as many of you know about three 
months ago; the central portrait in the images is her, in 
better days, when we were living in Brooklyn. Her glance is 
uncanny, a punctum which haunts me; when I work online, I feel 
an obdurate relation to the image, unwilling to cover it 
fully, as if she were present. This haunting is a weight, a 
memorial of sorts; I'm not yet willing to part with it. 
Somehow the image keeps her alive for me, a guardian and 
friend. The dialog between us comes through the pixels. I 
recognize the fetishistic aspect of my behavior here; I'm 
bound by it. Here are some images from my work; the windfarm 
is from a memorial film for my father. At times I live among 
the trees of death; my own mortality is a selfish obsession 
that always threatens me.

"The temporal has three times and therefore essentially never 
_is_ completely nor is completely in any one of the periods; the 
eternal _is._ A temporal object can have a multiplicity of 
varied characteristics; in a certain sense it can be said to 
have them simultaneously, insofar as in these definite charact- 
eristics it is that which it is. But reduplication in itself 
never has a temporal object; as the temporal disappears in time, 
so it exists only in its characteristics." - Kierkegaard, in 
Works of Love, trans. Hong and Hong.

The _sense_ in Kierkegaard tends towards spirituality; the 
_sense_ here tends towards the unraveling of scales towards an 
eternity whose perceived basis drops out, infinitely, in the 
depths of a time and space. The unraveling of sound, its living, 
is not this eternity, which is inconceivable and never perceived 
- yet it is what the music is about, its _concern._ One cannot 
listen to a concern which may also possess its infinities, its 
duress, but concern concerns an object, situation, process, 
habitus; this music, this _sound_ does not. Yet it disappears. 

Only, I say, by _becoming_ space and time, do we not disappear - 
do we, in fact, inhabit this music in a profound way which is 
theory's detour. Only in this way, detouring in fact through the 
literal _fabrication of files,_ themselves unraveling through 
protocols and dynamics grind one into the mesh and raster of an 
everyday life always on the lookout for healing. 

Healing through suture, boundary, protocol, carapace, domain, 
already strangles healing; let us call for another healing, and 
let us not call for an other. 

Such, here, and hear, is the eternity of this sound, which 
disappeared in its very making, hence already occupying the 
thetic of existence and the existence of the thetic: a literal 
far cry from the digital insertions into the raster that serves 
as a panoply of ordered graves.

killed them all. A Jew_ is overlooked in order to reorganize us 
as _those people,_ but the machine is going just outside the 
studio or why are they on the right side of the heavy traffic on 
the westside highway? Why are they? He knows they should be 
tortured and he tortures them, he tortures us. We'll still 
starve - but the image will be ok. I'm one of those people out 
there who are against your thinking-type and even I'm considered 
obdurate, stubborn, uncompromising, and look where it gets me? 
The scythe cuts through the flesh, scribbles dribble the 
semblance of a human body, we too often forget there are others. 
Everything must be considered and with the increase in warfare, 
temperature, population, weaponry, disease, and pollution, one

around the neighborhood," Argon Groan said. Range Anger agreed, 
but wasn't sure about the scaling. "There's definitely something 
to it," he replied. "To think that a few rules, as Wolfram might 
have it, can lead to anything as monstrous as this!" 
"Monstrous?" said Argon. "Monstrous?" There's always beauty - or 
something... beneath the surface. Surely the universe of Love 
Vole..." He was stopped in his tracks by Range, yelling "Move 
away from the Origin! Watch out for the raster gerbils!" They 
were everywhere, obscuring and entangling any conceivable ideas 
about patterning and code, as well as the languages of desire 
and comprehension. They were inherent in the work of M. Serres, 
who, however, refused the biological circumambulation.

*//glitch phenomena in local host/abandonment of habitus/
continuous depradation/disappearance and collapse. first
part of demi.mp4:analysis/second part:the journey//*

Years ago I worked on the idea of a general 'rule' that there 
were irretrievably unrelated domains in the universe/multiverse, 
regions which were inherently, deeply, out of touch, Bell's 
theorem or not. I postulated an unknowable-by-any-means, even 
though one might treat the 'law' paradoxically through a kind of 
sophistic sleight-of-hand. I bring this up because in this and 
every other virtual world, howsoever virtual might be defined, 
there are such presences; one might think of them as eruptions, 
but not eruptive signifiers of any sort. Technological and 
scientific wonders appear daily; what I'm considering however 
isn't such, nor commonplace, but elsewhere entirely, something 
outside any conceivable mapping. Our images, helpless, provide 
no guide. I can wish, and do, for a warmer world, one with even 
a slightly recognizable habitus, but outside our construction, 
there's nothing of the sort; as scientific knowledge gains, 
ground, the elsewhere both recedes (as if technology succeeds) 
and increases (as if instrumental reason fails. The failure is 
our own, has more to do with psychology and the psychoanalytical 
than with the world as such: a sociology is at work. And again, 
elsewhere, the sociology loses, is at a loss, as if overstepping 
its bounds.).

A demiurge or dramaturge returns to a scenario of creation in 
which a happening occurs, an occurrence happens, in which flight 
from her creation, or rather a garnered adieu, is her conceived 
choice. What's there is here, an ordinary sky, nothing towards 
or untoward the feet, nothing where beneath belief might be. She 
believes that is not in her works. There is the matter of the 
shudder or flashing realms of existence which are uncountable 
and unaccountable. No matter the absence of matter. What is the 
logic that clings to unknown laws?
