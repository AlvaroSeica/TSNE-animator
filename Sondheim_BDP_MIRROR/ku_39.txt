stain


stain - i'm born with it, witness to the caul
stigma - faint unidentifiable odor, you'd turn away, don't get close
blemish - i'm suppurating, can't control myself
defuge - you can sense i'm used up, always have been
sex - peripheral, disturbing on the periphery
unwholesome - shattered with torn edges, nothing fits into place
rootlessness - absence of place, nervous, pick my lips
rough-shod - defensive, can't see my way through my way, dirty
smudged - the glass distorts everything, there's nothing beyond it
smeared - almost obliterated, choked on filth, disheveled
obvious - it's obvious to everyone else but me
testimony - it's obvious to me through everyone else
stunted - i'm thwarted, can hardly speak, lost soul, helpless
helpless - i don't know i'm helpless, everyone wants me that way
fucked up - oh everyone thinks i'm that way
mess - everyone knows me that way
ill-mannered - i'm lost, isn't that obvious, outcast for good reason
dog, rat - they call me names of animals
marked - avoid me, cut out the heart, cauterize the voice, castrate
 the cock, amputate the limbs, gouge the eyes, devour the soul, kill
 the mind, pierce the ears, send the stump away, smear it
