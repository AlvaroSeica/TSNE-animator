Intermaths - Bailey (After Thought) - massive localized parallel process-
ing - for example, AL research, neural networking - but such processing as
_fundamental_ to the organization, epistemology, structure of physical
reality

Hugh Everett III - universal wave equation - monadic - many-worlds version
of QM (developed by Wheeler I think) - top down, absorbing parallel pro-
cessing - relate to probability and subsuming structure vis-a-vis calculus
of finite differences

GUTs (Grand Unified Theories) etc. - reductive, complex

Special and General Relativity - manifold-oriented, calculable top-down

Seething of intermaths - synergetic effects in the large (semi-autonomous
superstructure / culture) - production of autonomous artifacts as a result
of low-level parallel processing operations

Monolithic approach of Dawson etc. - problematic boundary-condition of 
memes, genetic determinism ("selfish" gene)

Mathematical neo-platonism - Pythagorean ordering of physical reality - 
particle defined _as equivalent to_ its numerical constants.
