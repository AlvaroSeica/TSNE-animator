Spoiled Cultures, Spoiled Goods, Spoiled Users*


You're right; I've been experimenting tonight with different browsers on
Web pages, and they're wildly different from each other, splayed all over
the place, even typefaces/sizes shifting in accordance with manufacture. 
Think of this in relation to the _standardization_ implicit in NTSC; those
color bars, waveform monitors, vectorscopes, etc. are all used to guaran-
tee a properly configured signal (chrominance, luminance, voltage levels,
etc., phase, etc.). And as I've pointed out before, the FCC in the US re-
quired that color reception be backwards-compatible with black-and-white. 

No such luck with frames, backgrounds, html extensions, java, cgi, etc.;
not only are scripts and commands disabled with older or different brand
browsers, but text is continuing to take back-seat to just about anything
else. Whatever happened to RFCs and their modicum of control? I'm begin-
ning to feel like a hateful oldtimer; sooner or later _something_ has to
settle in, after less hype and more testing. If not, the Web will continue
to develop piecemeal of course - but it will become less and less useful.

Did it ever occur to you that _the entire Iliad_ is nothing more than a
single _Iliad.txt_? Amazing that it held interest for close to three thou-
sand years...
