"The markings with which savage societies record, channel, regulate the 
coded flows of the energies produced in the couplings are not _read._ 
Savage inscriptions are not signs that refer to concepts; they are 
diagrams and paths for the hand. The leopard footprint one sees on the 
path does not refer to the name and notion of leopard, but links up 
directly with the leopard itself. The leopard claw-print that one sees 
inscribed by the human hand on the path or on the body of the initiate 
does not refer to the voice that utters the name 'leopard' and conceives 
the meaning of that name; it directly designates the leopard itself."
