Chucking Values

I'm chucking values this evening.
The first to go is the transvaluation of all values.
This just won't do and besides makes a mess of some of the little ones!
You can get the best values for your money if you chuck the old ones!
There are always rooms for new values emptied of old ones chucked!
A chucked value is valueless even if it is a transvaluation.
No, wait! A chucked transvaluation is worth a lot of the little ones.
The little ones gather in a group as if they were capable of speech.
My values are my clothes! I chuck them and dress in transvaluations.
Everyone knows me here and understands I do this daily.
What others call contrary behavior I call value-chucking.
What others consider contradictory I find falls apart.
The contradictory falls apart because one thing follows another.
There are never simultaneous things in my world of transvaluations.
If there were, I could chuck them simultaneously.
Everyone knows I try to do this just about all the time.
I'm hated in some circles as a result, but that's just another value.
I chuck those values in each and every direction.
That's part of my transvaluation which does the chucking for me.
No value-chucking for my transvaluation! It will have to go!
