Primacy of the Visual, Footnote


Turning momentarily towards video (there are forthcoming screenings), I
find the pleasure of the writerly text increasingly fragile; the mapping
between video representation and the real appears informal, everyday,
and ikonic. I can talk, walk with the image; I can be seduced by it. The
screen pulsates; it's skin.

Text is lean; everything is at stake with text. There is no escape, noth-
ing but _deliberation_ or construct to produce effect. In short, a wager,
strategy, contract. In (literal) contrast, the camera may simply _lay_
there, an act of monitoring, absorption. It engulfs the subject, subject-
ivity. Unlike classic cinema, it may well be an unloosening of meaning,
just as Photoshop restores it.

It may be the breast or fissure, in relation to, vis-a-vis the hand, in-
scription.

I emphasize this as I close my eyes, and for the first time in a long
time, the World Wide Web notwithstanding, images appear. Like the gaze on
CuSeeMe, they remain silent, harboring the uncanny (not the ontology of
the textual-virtual body, but the realm of the physico-inert). Ah well, I
think, ah, ah, ah. If I open my mouth, it is not for speech, but for the
well of the world; it is _there._
