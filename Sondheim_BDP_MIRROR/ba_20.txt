Brhadaranyaka Upanishad, I/4/17 (emphasis mine):

"In the beginning this (variety of covetable objects) was but the self -
just a single entity. He desired, 'Let me have a wife, so that I may be
born (as a child), and let me have wealth, so that I may perform rites.' 
Desire verily comprises this much. Therefore even now a man, being single,
desires, 'Let me have a wife, so that I may perform rites.' So long as he
does not get each of these, he thinks he is but incomplete.  His incomp-
leteness (may take place in this way) too: The mind verily is his self,
speech his wife, the vital force his progeny, the eye his human wealth -
since he attains it with the help of the eye, the ear his divine wealth -
since he hears it through the ear, AND THE BODY ITSELF HIS RITE, since he
performs rites through the body. (So) this is a (mental) sacrifice con-
sisting of five factors, and whatever exists consists of five factors. One
who knows thus attains all this." (trans. Nitya Chaitanya Yati.)
