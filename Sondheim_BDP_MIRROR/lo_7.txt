the incessant shaking of the world, Levinas, insomnia


it is too abstracted. it is open to the making of the world. surround and
no thing; it is open and the cry of entities are heard at a distance. the
hunger. it is never a moment of proper awakening. i see the world exhaus-
ted, decathected of meaning. it is my privilege to witness the exhaustion
of the world, its uneasy lies. my illness is derived from the cloth of my
world. i write somnolent, exhausted. therefore entities shimmer, are gone,
before their mentioning. the guise of the name is all they possess, which
closes them down. i see through the lies of the name.

inscribed on tablets of stone and clay the guise of the name is all they
possess; they're closed down. entities are uncanny; they lose their moor-
ing in the guise of the name.

your enunciation naming entities is uncanny; they lose their mooring in
the guise of the name. ghost ghost ghost ghost ghost:thing thing thing
