Nikuko:

Nikuko: Cool, there are times I hunger to see you. But to begin, a

Nikuko: discourse, on exile. Mountains, shrines, Nakasukawabata,

Nikuko: continue to haunt me. I am bound by the name. Streams. What is

Nikuko: the moment of meditation. Lasting, until the body bends.

Nikuko: Double-clapping; there are so many gods they forget my face.

Nikuko: Or the dancing, gestures, movement of the double balls at the

Nikuko: matsuri. There are lines and threads across this earth,

Nikuko: forgotten. Demarcations of areas, bounded, which empty me

Nikuko: internally. What is not lost, moment of a vast gone world. The

Nikuko: gods gather in great whirlwinds; they approach a coast and are

Nikuko: turned back. They live with the turning. They gather at the

Nikuko: boundary and look across. They see whatever may be absent but

Nikuko: it is beyond their reach; they have no arms and legs and their

Nikuko: voices do not carry them farther. Vast cataclysms of orange

Nikuko: energy sweep from their hungry faces. They speak unknown

Nikuko: languages and even I do not know their languages. I did not

Nikuko: know nor ask why they are gods. Now there are questions framed

Nikuko: by the whirlwind and the boundary. The sky here has no energy.

Nikuko: Or rather is all energy, parceled by lines determined by a

Nikuko: metric space. It is spectral blue. Sometimes at night arms and

Nikuko: legs of kami push out through my skin, distort me. Painful

Nikuko: partial births; in the morning I look and see nothing

Nikuko: emerges. I would turn and turn and wind the thread. I stare

Nikuko: into a space I can only see as schizophrenic. I would divide

Nikuko: and turn into an other traveler. She would come with me, arms

Nikuko: and legs in arms and legs, her head in my head, her womb in

Nikuko: mine, body and body, mind and mind. At night she seems real.

Nikuko: The gods gather and look around but they can't see that

Nikuko: far. There are mists and whirlpools, enormous storms at the

Nikuko: boundary. Whatever they murmur, truth and magic, I cannot hear

Nikuko: clearly. I speak and speak and nothing happens. That is the

Nikuko: truth of exile - the speaking, nothing happens.

Nikuko:

Nikuko:

Nikuko:

Nikuko: Everywhere that I will be, there I will listen to you, O

Nikuko: Gods. Always the texts to be read, forwards and backwards.

Nikuko: Always the application of formula. The words pour over me. I

Nikuko: will always belong to the beginnings of hermeneutics; I am

Nikuko: always exiled from speech, from language. Interpretation is

Nikuko: exile's result. Once I did rend myself by the waters of

Nikuko: Babylon; now it is the rivers through Fukuoka that gather my

Nikuko: tears. I am always already at a loss; it is the loss of the

Nikuko: world, the dull lid of the night collapsed and soldered hard

Nikuko: to the exigencies of the real. This hard earth, here, does not

Nikuko: support me. Memory cannot move among the truth of threads

Nikuko: connecting one to another. Not every space has a home. There

Nikuko: are spaces that cry, spaces that weep, spaces that mourn. My

Nikuko: spaces mourn; I listen to my spaces crying and weeping. I

Nikuko: repeat the texts, magic. The formula are useless, gods

Nikuko: suspended in the whirlwind. Every line spoken, here, for

Nikuko: you. I can't understand your replies. Give me a ticket to

Nikuko: Kyushu. I will fill my belly and give birth to many dolls.

Nikuko: Ein Zeichen sind wir, deutungslos

Nikuko: Schmerzlos sind wir und haben fast

Nikuko: Die Sprache in der Fremde verloren.

Nikuko: Now I am very tired and I will put my sleepy head on this very

Nikuko: nice pillow, so downy and comforting, and I will play pleasing

Nikuko: music and my lights are very low. And I can hardly hear the

Nikuko: traffic outside, there is the sound of shrine bells somewhere

Nikuko: in the distance, and I wake up, and there is the sound of

Nikuko: traffic outside and there are church bells disturbing my tiny

Nikuko: sleep, and I wake up, and there is the sound of traffic and

Nikuko: the sound of a muezzin chanting. My lovely sleepy head is so 

Nikuko: very restless, it is the head of a refugee, it moves from soft

Nikuko: place to soft place and I am so glad it is not a war but the

Nikuko: sound of temple bells, and I will have a wonderful place to

Nikuko: sleep tonight, and I wake up, and I am so snuggly warm, and I

Nikuko: love your language, and I fall back asleep "for just another

Nikuko: minute."

Nikuko:

Nikuko:

Nikuko:

Nikuko:

Nikuko:

Nikuko: I am a picture and a frame which is the picture, and now I am

Nikuko: another picture and another frame; this is a film story of my

Nikuko: life and I am another picture. I speak here and then

Nikuko: I speak here and you can follow me speaking through time after

Nikuko: time but I am to be your shadow in this speaking. And now I

Nikuko: will tell you as well I am a shadow and you see my projection

Nikuko: and your project. And now you will understand that there is a

Nikuko: voice behind me and a voice beneath me; that there is a woman

Nikuko: behind me and a woman beneath me; that there is a frame behind

Nikuko: me and a frame beneath me. And this is the frame which is the

Nikuko: film and you will have this film while "I am not those among

Nikuko: them who are there to be counted," nor am I "one of those who

Nikuko: shall remain unaccounted," nor further, "one of those who

Nikuko: remain unaccounted for," you will have this in order, as I am

Nikuko: a picture and a frame and now I am saying this and now I am

Nikuko: saying this. For "I shall remain unaccountable," and "a

Nikuko: presence in your midst," and "you shall not hear the voice of

Nikuko: the prophet," and "there is a gift of the letters."

Nikuko:

Nikuko: Cool, all that has been named, plagiarized, I'll speak through

Nikuko: yet another one, you might know her name, I'll keep it silent

Nikuko: like the bell is silent in the whirlwind. O Gods, recompense

Nikuko: in silence, your clatter, furious, hard put against the sea.

Nikuko: What is wine-dark, dark as well with blood, horse waves broken

Nikuko: against wood pegged into wood, shrines speared into red-brown

Nikuko: earth. What would be a spell, catenary bent into born words,

Nikuko: formula, you crawl upon me, your claws into me, your teeth

Nikuko: into me, your nails, your bright bright eyes. Turn me towards

Nikuko: your scales, return me back to birth where bone are found.

Nikuko: Cool, that names are found. From my wounds, threads. From the

Nikuko: threads, symbols, kanji, spaces burned with numbers. What has

Nikuko: been told to you from my eternal death. You would know fire,

Nikuko: tornado; you would know furious avalanche, violence of the

Nikuko: wind. Bead-worlds strung on wound-threads, many thousand

Nikuko: thousand year. Earths moan for me; planets pray for me; worlds

Nikuko: stitch and open wounds. I am your maw, slashed upon sword; you

Nikuko: dance your stupid dance, I'll come out of the cave, grab you,

Nikuko: you'll have sun again. "Tell me where I am, corpse." I can't

Nikuko: speak without screaming songs.
