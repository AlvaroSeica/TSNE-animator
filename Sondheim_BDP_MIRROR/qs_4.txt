have time to live.
[6Bi'm waiting for a message from garcia. i've been waiting for the 
message since
[13B hello hello. there is static on the line. it is difficult to ransack 
memory in this fashion. i am garcia. i understand there is a message. 
there is confusion on the lind e. i am waiting for the end of confusion. 
it is better to have the me message late than not at all.
[8Byes yes that is true. sevastopol. think sevastopol. you do remember 
don't you g garcia.
[5Bnights and days i n sevastopol. it's coming back to me. i remember the 
dropoff p point. the old telegraph station, the key. it was winter, the 
worst, the very w worst of snows.
[7Cyes, we waited and waited for each other, didn't we. and it seemed 
almos almost as if it was to no avail. do yoyu u remember how man enacing 
the world seemed, how hopeless. and now. -
[8Band now things have gone from bad to worse, and the message, filled 
with death

when ev everything is, that the dimensionality of the unniverse itself has

[8Bas with all creatures, we're going to die, perhaps a bit early, perhaps 
in a bi bit more debris, surrounded by debris cho , or choking on debris, 
but die m j , just as

[19;1Hbut only this urgency e for us, for no one else, our private sevba 
astopol, the las
of the messages for garcia,
[9;1Hthe last of the messages for nuk ikuko, for n anyone, the last of 
what might have bee lalasting
[10Bmight have been lasting, if only for a while, the shortest while, the 
tiniest mmoment, fleeting smile in the very last spring of the world -
[8Bah goodbye, b
goodbye, meeting is neither sweet nor sorrow, but the meat of death
[9;1Hitself...
