the work of the crazed

why this work matters even when written under duress
why philosophy cannot disregard theory responsive to illness or depression
notes towards the problematic perception of worlds
inscriptions faltering along fault-lines of explanatory discourse

depression and/or illness as a gateway to truth because of
 decathecting of concern - beyond that of inscription - almost
 as the skittering of inscription
depression and internalized anger: potential eidetic reduction
 to substance - (bemused inability to focus/catatonic: to think
 purely eidetically -> absence of thought)
                          /* who is writing this?
                             i refuse these labels! /*
illness as the distraught of the world -
 as the distraught of the word - 'holding onto the book' -
 the book as secret/ive discourse -
release of the book as the decathecting of illness,
 not the re-cuperation or re-presentation of health -
 not the therapeutic

the eternal road of the book as foreclosing problematic ontologies
the book as world and object
always misrecognizing the real
truth and hopelessness

the crazed of the work

theory because this is miami.

strengthening to hurricane status and flood watch for southern florida
boats on fire in fort lauderdale and trees broken in north miami
moisture index high and drawn into central miami towards ludlum avenue
windstorm down ludlum avenue taking a right on 46th street
green anoles crawling down 46th street taking a left in the sunken drive
monitors walking slowly over speed bumps crawling up the soaked walls
wall of water over the second story slamming into 252 where we're
soaked and crawling, strengthened to ward off anoles but not anomalies

because of the persistence of academic affairs we are not allowed to shut
the doors of our offices if there is a student of any degree of opposition
sex within. the halls of the department of art are filled with television
cameras - we're pure exhibits - we're there for them; there is nothing to
steal but our imaginary. the cameras hug the ceiling like green anoles,
their burst eyes flooding us with marrow for thought. let me tell you that
thought.

eyes damage thought, spear thought; they glare through dreams in which we
edit dreams to our liking. they are vectors of configuration; they divide
and cauterize space. there is a corner of the secretary's office in which
we are unwatched, cutting each other with thin knives; the blood drips
anonymously were it not for dna. azure carves out my cock:  EIDETIC
REDUCTION  and in return i damage her breasts:  CHORATIC EFFLORESCENCE.  
i reduce or am her reduction; she extends or turns my exponential. in
front of the cameras, for an unseen audience, we mutilate.

because this is miami, blood pours from our mouths; we leaving fast in
this theater of the real. when we fall into the range of the cameras -
when we are seen - we are covered with blood, our sight gone; instead,
silent, with infinite wisdom, we carry the truth of theory, the
efflorescence of thought, forever towards our almost immediate death.

because this is miami, we will wake up thick after our performance; the 
faked blood is cleansed like the dust-free department of art staring at 
us. just before we leave we'll show them everything than shoot out the 
lights.

as long as i can write, she dreams


nikuko wakes up, it's a bed of roses, kanji etched by thorns cutting deep 
into her, blood streaming out of her

listen: without the brush of the calligrapher, signs flow, written to the
real - blood streaming across her breasts, down her thighs, paralleling, 
converging where her legs meet and part

lying, she reads dendy: 'It is clear, at least, that the deep interest of
the subject of reflection overbalances the influences of the external sen-
ses. The impression of objects is either too slight or rapid to produce
perception (in other words); however the impression may be imparted to the
brain by the nerve, the brain is not _sensible_ of it, and there is there-
fore no perception.  So intense, indeed, has been this influence, that
Pliny contemplated the volcanic philosophy amid the ashy cloud of Vesuvius
by which he was destroyed.'

in blood, she thinks of the _capital_ idea: within the marks of quotation,
everything is permitted

bleeding, she thinks of the ashy cloud inscribing the philosophy of the 
world, learning to read from the world, after all is said and done

death is never a writing; she has been far too long journeying, only to
return with this capital idea, that of the calligraphy of the world, con-
ditioned by natural topographies, as the blood flows from her body
distended by thorns, at first the appearance of the 'river' character,
coupling into 'mountains,' 'roots'

she turns and turns, naked against the bushes, draining her body; lizards 
watch her, birds watch over her

she is writing the world into existence, she is no longer speaking

writing and writing

construct of phenomenological catalyst


1 behind this text is the phenomenological structure of truth. think of
the origin splayed out across the horizon of the subject, the scanning of
a pre-existing landscape. the phenomenological horizon involves mourning
and death as analytical/structural/phenomenological concerns, running
some- where among the latter, a phenomenological metaphysics of identity.
this is the traditional phenomenological approach - peering at the world
and borders,

the phenomenological 'world of the text' ruptures, opening and bridging
the mathematico-abstract, material, and phenomenological by a grouping of
horizons whose parameters are established and undetected or are described
purely through intrasubjective approaches. a phenomenological wager, here
within the deployment of a certain historiography of contestation, which
also represents the phenomenological horizon of the imaginary in relation
to the real. one is concerned with imminence, the onto-epistemological
horizon of the user, but only in relation to the tripartite grouping. this
grouping is a construct (nothing new here); there are syntactics 'about' a
phenomenological-interpretive mode - from the high-level that we imagine
time itself - which may be pure surface. 

finally, there is the theorizing of the virtual - from a horizon of
correspondence, and the eidetic through this. such an approach emphasizes
a naturality of inscription or 'letting go' in spite of everything. 

2 i am intended within a given phenomenological project - thus i am based
upon a logic of equivalence, turning the image to the phenomenological
field of the body itself. this field, this logic, even the underlying
logic of equivalence, are lost among the foreclosing of the symbolic; in
its place i tend towards nikuko, her blood body, body of blood, streaming
into description against phenomenology, against reading: thus this text,
the philosophic, resists interpretation - such is its work or isn't it?

o what we are doing is writing stories. this is what i was doing when it
happened: this is what i felt: this is what i heard 
oo this is what i was doing when it happened: this is what i felt: this is
what i heard
ooo the stories begin, develop, end: the stories follow the traditional 
logic of time extrapolated from human behavior: from the human construct 
of the world until: one's death
oooo we tell the stories because we are in the midst of them and part of a 
vast human communality and we tell these stories because they come to an 
end and we understand how to make ends
ooooo here's where i am now after it happened: this is what i went 
through: i am a witness to the world: i was there when it happened
oooooo what we are doing is speaking: we are writing truths and truths
oooooo what we are doing is making: we are writing fiction and comfort: we 
are writing ourselves into existence: into existence after it happened
ooooo we rewind: here is what i made happen: this is what the world went 
through: the world is a witness through my fiction: the world is here
oooo we make up stories to place us within a human communality that we 
comment upon from within, without, from the periphery: we write these 
stories because they have beginnings and they are fine beginnings and we 
understand how to write: how to write the world
ooo the stories are forced into beginnings and endings: they follow the 
traditional human meandering: the human continuity across what later might 
be considered fictional events: what happened in the story:
oo this is the event i am making up: this is the plot of my story: this is 
a good, a wonderful plot: this is quite original
oo.o you write as if you were there, as if you were part of it: as if you 
were part of something
o what we are doing is telling truths: these events almost seem real: you 
write so well, almost as if these things happened: you turn fiction into 
truth

premonitions of terror 1994-2001


you, a sign of terror, just as or a talker witnessed the last evil, last
terror, last goodness, last era of redemption. on course, and more, that
war and terrorism always create horizons of death. They saw terrorism as
an edge which defined them, because it was terrors, pains, ennui, the
sickness of decay striking terror into the second. The second therefore
shall enter with joy and terror, breathing the world undone. Of our
thinking together, the terror and relief, the terrorist manuals on the
Net, child pornography, and anarchic hacking everywhere. So there it was:
error messages of violence and terror, no reply from terror in my eyes.
Behind me I could hear the screech of packets, passion raining terror and
ecstasy. But it was a mystery or a story with no sense at all. I was in
total terror and panic.

"Why a Nostril wide inhaling terror, trembling, & affright?" I won't tell
you how much he terrifies me. He comes out of terror. He is this hell. I
was in fantastic pain and terror, embedded in this computer: spy SEAL Team
6 Peking NSA terrorist SDI FBI Panama FSF munitions security, signifying
red-flag/black-flag terror.

An army of terrorists supports various anti-imperialist causes. He uses
socio-economic development for change, with or without terror that on
occasion holds greater terrors than darkness out-of-doors. This was the
Pacific; Albanian finance terrorists are hung by their tongues from it. I
was a terror at school.

Linda gazed in admiration, Margaret gaped at it in terror, and Lisa was
still alive, terrorized, exhausted, aroused, despondent, hopeless. It was
the time of pure bombs and pure bombing, it wasn't terrorism or your pain,
disability, stress or terror. Sometimes now i will survey the lands of all
these letters of terror. And the grafters in terror are trembling.

There's terror at the top, I'm going home, I'd rather dance on an empty
century of terrorisms and bombs, the century in which the population
opened their mouths. The word carries its own terror; born of division,
among one. Did it end in /dev/null? Was it the beginning of incipient
terror?

The terror of my writing is its lack of depth. No one wants pornography;
no one looks at it: terrorist manuals on the Net talk freely about our
terrorisms and assassinations them. A fray is a fight in a public place,
the terror of the people, in which one is already withdrawing to the
anonymity of history and terror. Males are haunted, haunt themselves by
KALI, inflict terror into bodies, across bodies, beneath the feet of
bodies. Male are haunted by terror.

Organisms can't live in the terror of cyberspace, the wind howls in their
havens of safety from gang and terrorist violence; they also sense danger,
a sense of imminent terror. The wraiths of terror, fleeting descendents of
the furies, an evening meal, considered diversionist acts and acts of
terrorism from the point of view of Trotsky and incompletion.

FSF explosion CIA radar Soviet Uzi fissionable terrorist bomb Cocaine:
considered diversionist acts and acts of terrorism from the point of view
making his, Trotsky's, position stronger. There once were men who terror-
ized the villages. They continued, plundering, raping, and murdering.
Help me! Nothing, no terror, nothing! I have no plans! There's never any
time of terror, submerged eyes, mouths - only wings of terror, terrified.

To Everyone,


This is poorly written, but it has been on my mind for the past two days:

I mourn the passing of 6000 or more lives, like everyone else. I cry like
everyone else over this. I work through mourning, like everyone, and lose
sleep, watch the news, like everyone. And I support the elimination of
terrorism, coupled with a redistribution of wealth and communications on a
global scale, like many of us. This may be another story, or it may be the
same story.

But I do not fly an American flag, wear red white and blue; this tragedy
does not make me patriotic, only sad. I fear patriotism and leadership; I 
fear nationalism which all too often degenerates into further drawings of 
lines, further ignorance, further racisms.

I fear, in other words, the calls to the flag, the calls to Americanism, 
the calls to patriotism.

And I do not seek vengeance or violence, and I deplore the rhetoric of war, 
vengeance, and violence dominating the news. I resent the transformation of 
tragedy into this rhetoric, mourning into firearms.

I fear, in other words, the calls for war, the calls for vengeance, the 
violence already enacted against Arabs in our streets.

I do not pray to God, to any God, and I resent the implications that this 
should be our means of dealing with the tragedy, or coming together as a 
nation.

I fear, in other words, the call to religion, even for those of us who
have no belief, no religion, no desire to create even more havoc in the 
names of gods who can only be unjust.

A lot of us find our country turning away from us, just as it turns to 
war, nationalism, flags, patriotism, and vengeance above all. Eliminating 
terrorism is one thing - the rhetoric and all it implies, is something 
else again, incredibly dangerous. The tragedy did not make me feel "more 
an American" - if anything, it makes me feel more an internationalist than 
ever - so many foreign citizens were also killed. And if the Net has 
taught us anything, it is that ultimately we will all rise and fall 
together, not separated by boundaries tempered only by the vagaries of 
history.

We already see the result of the rhetoric in the violence against Arabs,
or anyone appearing "Arab-looking," across the United States.

Let us do whatever we can to endure. But let us also speak out, with care, 
on and off the Net, before we are all silenced.

And let us mourn.

Alan

The Film-Video 5184


Completed tonight, 72 x 72 square pixels, roughly one pixel for each of
the missing. The visual image: high-density of computer-generated hairs
and scratches: random (visual) noise as content.

The audio: Slow tuning on an analog television through VHF and UHF sta-
tions: most of the sound is audio noise (including beacons and other audio
debris): sound-bites (sound-bytes) from a number of stations, almost all
covering the World Trade Center tragedy, are heard.

The relationship: Buried content in noise: noise becoming content: content
becoming noise. Cognitively: hairs and scratches appear as _noise genera-
tors_ drowning out speech, location, proper names, narratives. Philosoph-
ically: the difficult issues of 'making sense' of events: relationship
between background microwave radiation noise (read: universe-narrative)
and the struggling of event-description: the repetition of content-as-
reading and reading-as-content: the oddly mesmerizing effect of apparent
random sound and sight against the background of the black square filed/
defiled as defile or file of the missing: the smoothed computer-generated
imaginary of dirt/dust/clutter against the inert and always already de-
constructed surface of video: debris against and through technological
contradiction. Materiality of film, imaginary of video.

Content: Working late into the night, rendering over and over again, a
process of mourning, the creation of a film-video tombstone, tears and
therapeutic at the edge or lip of the grave.

Brilliance


What we fear most, here, is the brilliance of the plan which has been at 
least five years in the making - that the machine that hit the Pentagon 
was traveling at 345 miles an hour, that the planes were not only taken 
but maliciously piloted after five years of subterfuge and masquerade by 
people without very much experience on passenger jets.

And what we fear is also conspiracy, for, finally, our predilection
towards subterfuge, belief in surface erosion, has come true with a
vengeance: Here we are, now, suspicious of our neighbors, redefining
ourselves as a nation, as individuals, against the rot that appears 
to lie within and without. All those theories about JFK, Area 52, the
CIA, Martin Luther King, LSD, the fall of the left, turn out to be 
true.

It's the trouble with cancer, existing for years in the body, springing 
out hard, retreating to tissues and organs where elimination is pyrrhic at 
best - finally, nothing escapes destruction.

"They hide in caves," live in vaginas, pockets of bodies which are both 
feared and stases of desire. They are primitive, woman-like, they won't 
come out and fight like a man; we'll have to go in and get them. They have 
nothing to lose, they don't have big cities, nothing to defend. 

They might as well be Jews, might as well be Arabs, might as well be 
Women. The West slams into nomads with firepower; the fear, the menses, 
remains unspoken as we overly theorize and articulate geopolitical 
concerns, strategies, ideologies, positioning.

What they did, they were good at; what they did, they are good at, and we 
don't know what that is.

of the great void or chasm beneath the surface


you can see them rising:smoke rising, fog, you can see them:i dream of a
vast void-chasm::

ascending through the chasm-void:they are rising, rising up:you can see 
them rising, you can see them, rising up::

rising from the dark chasm-void chasm:the lost 5400, you can see them
rising:almost distinct, the 5400::

i dream of the wounding darkness:i dream of the 5400, one by one by one:
i dream of the chasm, the void::

of the indistinct cloth, of the face in the cloth through my dream of
the wounding darkness!

i have come out and coming out and coming out:the lost, the indistinct,
the traced:i have come out and coming out and coming out:the 5400, the
5400, the 5400:

the 5400, the 5400, the 5400, i have come out and coming out and coming
out!

from the womb-chasm, from the void, they are rising:they are rising,
they are rising:it is time, one time, and it is time again:the 5400,
5400, the 5400:the 5400, 5400, the 5400

the 5400, 5400, the 5400

the 5400, almost distinct, they are rising up:around me they are rising,
they are rising, they are rising:i will not dream, will not abide, will
never wake from dream::they are rising, rising up, i stay asleep, i will 
sleep, i will not abide, i will stay asleep

i stay asleep, remain asleep, they are rising, they are rising,
they are rising up

You drop note. I am afraid of war. I am not going to war.
There appears to be some writing on the note ... I am an innocent person.
There appears to be some writing on the note ... I am very innocent.

Written in 1998:

Is this whatever truth there is?
Because I wonder what the biz is.
Or if the biz is biz.
And who are you to gain the plane
Which has taken off (your clothes)
Leaving you plain and in pain
And nothing left you suppose
To your brain but a stain
When there is nothing to gain
Here hexed by text
Nothing more before
Nothing left to store

My Poem by Julu

(You finish reading.)
look note
read note
            
Dream: There are people crawling on the ground. Dream: There are
mountains. Dream: There are great planes. Dream: There are clouds
and scars of many colors. Dream: Tents. 

I will dream in my tent in the mountain. The woman-child mountain, 
starvation mountain. Julu tends me with a kind and tender hand.
Dream: I am crawling on the ground. Dream: Do not abide revenge.
Dream: Of bombs falling.

All my life this dream: of falling bombs.

/the seven

   On-line permits the recuperation of institutional content (medical, 
	support-groups, medical, addictions, see needs),
all the medical/psychological groups. The research email list of heaven,
of immune deficiency and other diseases, increased medical technologies,
are psychoanalytical, AIDs, unemployment, and medical services nearby,
like himself, he may purvey gerontological postings to medical data-bases.
1943 There are early screen memories of _being carried_ on medical
systems: ecological, war, economic, medical, immune, technological, what 
happened to me, why i am here.

1/1 the medical model will be needed; with no crowd of medical men to
guard against unforeseen to get the medical certification, whereas I'd
rather go for antibiotics, breathing medical mist. So I can't concentrate
hello who are you, you are medical "imaging" centers, fertilizers,
packaged hydrogen, transportation, utilities, shelter, medical care, among
other things, but - a medical military model - there are arts,
architecture, law, medical, medicine, mba, public affairs, location,
incision and the growth of new skin observed by the medical team. But
these records are medical records with names, for cardiac arrest and
various medical/hospital/psychiatric services in the area as well.

from the annals


doctor, i am impure. i cannot fight. i cannot find my enemy. i look inside
myself and nothing is there. there are stains there, blemishes. my skin is
scarred, mottled. impure, i cannot believe. everything in the world is
lost to me. i don't know the gift of names.

i don't know the gift of names because to name is to foreclose. love, you
are my friend; hate, you are my enemy. i am impure and i do not know when
one becomes the other. i shall hide out in the caves. i shall be killed
in them.

i came to you to discover, if not purity, then belief. i want to know the
books and theories, the explanations. i want to deconstruct impurity. i
want to know impurity as a symptom, not an essence. i cannot abide
essence. i want to know the shelving and layering of all things. of which
impurity is not one or the other, like an imaginary number, fabricated,
weak in its ontology.

every other is not an other, has an imaginary. this is a real problem for
me, the "me" itself is cancerous, perhaps carcinogenic. divisions force
impurity; i am symptom of the world's collapse. perhaps that is how you
can help me, to transform the word into a symptom or collocation, an
accumulation of mutilated signs.

nothing you do, doctor, bothers me; you are the filter through which i see
myself. yesterday there were flags everywhere; i did not fly one or carry
one. i cannot understand the cloth. it soaks up signs and disturbances,
collapses fields and membranes to nodes, freezes out plasma in the name of
the crystal. it is as if i have read that somewhere, "the crystal." it is
not enough i can read, parse the text, pass "crystal" into insufficiency.

you are trying, doctor, to pin this down. patriotism, ideology, religion,
bring it out in me, the pinning, from which, on the other side of the
flesh, there is only emission, spewing, abjection. the hole or cave - i'll
hide there, impure. or rather the hard external world perhaps, with its
clean and proper body, its white room, its facticity and language gaming -
perhaps you might find the tiniest spot there, the spread of cancer. in
the cave it's all fucking; if we die, we'll die with our cunts open, cocks
erect, the only use of triggering, catalyst, protein holding together
until the last violent explosion and collapse.

when the last collapse comes, the impure becomes pure; the pure becomes
impure. we welcome that; without guns, we fuck the language, fuck our
bright ideas. the only idea left in the world is already dissolving, the
idea of cancer, the tumor of northsoutheastwest, the tumor of
firstsecondthirdworld, the tumor of animalplant, of becomingwomanman.

if the last collapse comes, there will be unbearable pain, spreading
across sheets of flesh, tissue, torn tissue, rendered flesh, articulated
animations, pixels crawling across the screen.

if i wanted to save myself i would, yes, have consulted a medical doctor;
it's the psychiatrist i want, to place me in the light of the patriot,
save me from impurity, from a life suffocated in impurity. i can't forget
that death alone has a finality while life is nothing more than
meandering, useless crawling, skittering, nothing at all.

when life is nothing more than that, aphanisis sets in, everything goes
away, i'm no longer there, nothing is responsible for action. wouldn't you
prefer that doctor, wouldn't you like to see my cunt, my cock, my disease,
my lovely lure?

what would happen would be in your hands, your cunt, your cock, you'd take
me in your arms, you'd swallow my sores, my blemished skin, you'd make me
a patriot, o love flag of white and red and blue.

are you afraid of the truth, doctor, of your categories, are you afraid of
your anatomy?

i am only afraid of this, the tiniest little mark on my lovely flesh,
whole nations fall on this mark.

i am terrified of nations collapsing, life dissolving - only as they keep
me alive, dying in this place, dying indefinitely, look, another mark, i
shall give them names.

i was first frightened by nations, look, a third just there, you can see
them spreading, when they became part of me, when i could no longer
imagine events, when i collapsed into the page, there's a fourth and a
fifth now, they're everywhere.

yes, they are growing across me, through me, spewing in and out of my
cock, my cunt, they are tearing my body into pieces, blinding me, my eyes
are gouged, tongue torn out, they have left my fingers alone.

i am not afraid of sex, my fingers crawl across my body, they find my
cock, my cunt, they penetrate and distend me, they turn me inside out, my
fingers are broken, they are joining multitudes, there are so many of
them.

there are too many of them, they are fucking me everywhere.

history is dead, i am impure, i shall rise up, i shall rise up

i shall rise up with nations, i shall seethe with nations, i shall wear
their flags, sing their songs, march with them

i will go to war, i will go to war

i will go to war i will go to war

                                is fighting

               fighting*


*the other would like to have an imaginary.

there are other people there
they fold into me and i am multitudes
my mouth is filled with their words
i close everything into silent
thus will be the edge or ridge against the lip of chaos
down here there is no light
there are only stories and bodies
this is the defile of the world
there are no survivors

Subject: Hello

why you haven't heard from me, because i am in miami
and as far as i can see, there are no protests, and i
don't say much on the street because the right-wing's strong,
and at the university there's salsa dancing and not much else,
one of the students thought the terrorists were 'faggots,'
which seemed to go over well, i was told that the word's ok, 
because they use it all the time in spanish. so i
try to survive by typing furiously and making what work i can,
but the debate - i want to be there participating in new york,
i got myself into this fix, i talk to people here all i can,
it means nothing, the sun's hot, lizards everywhere, radio's 
filled with soppy jingoism far to the right of limbaugh, 
we're americans, it's frustrating we just can't nuke them,
most of us would like to go to war even if it resulted in us
casualties, do you honestly trust your next-door neighbor,
i sleep hardly at all. it's a foreign land, it's heartland
rubbed raw in repetition, i want to apologize for my meaningless
life of self-indulgence, i want to do something that matters,
i forward uselessly, sign occasional petitions (there are 100s
and i don't think they matter much), i don't think the lists
make much of a difference, i think there are evil men who 
think like miami out there, they're taking us towards far 
worse hells, raise our fists, they're charred

this is just stupidity, decadent opinion, the perversity of
someone who keeps writing against the day the wires sputter, 
don't worry, he's well aware of the strategy and mediocrity of 
this reply to no one

you look at a star you have never seen before
and there is a wound in the side and you know it's war
and you know there is suffering and something is gone
against the dark light of some other's sun
so you turn away to your own and you say
this is my own and this is the day
and the sky turns to ash and the light from the star
is gone in the glare and none from afar
is looking at you and none from afar
is taking you in 
and looking at you are none from afar
gone from the glare and none from afar
in the sky turned to ash in the light from the star
and this is my own and this is my day
so you turn away to your own and you pray
against the dark light of some other's sun
where you know someone suffers and someone is gone
from the wound in the side and you know it's war
when you look at the star you've not seen before
