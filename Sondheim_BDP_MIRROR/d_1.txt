If you are lying next to me in bed,

You turn away, you are next to his head,

Your hands are between your legs, mine are there

Reaching towards you, you finger his hair

In the empty air in the cold air



If you are lying, I lying deep within you,

Reaching into gristle, marrow, bone and sinew,

My mouth talking hysterically to keep you there

Reaching towards you, thrusting in despair

In the empty air in the cold air



If you are speaking words before unspoken,

He murmurs in his sleep, your words are broken

And I disappear, his skin is always there

The bed is always bare, you are still so fair

In the empty air in the cold air



You are still so fair, in the cold air
