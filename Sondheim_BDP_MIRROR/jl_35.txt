Expulsion/Prediction

I have come to the conclusion: I am completely unemployable. Born with air
in my lungs and water in my chest, I am in the process o;zlsoifj;olea
C4lj5m OF LONG EXHALATION. WHY WOULD ANYONE COLLAPSE LIKE THIS WERE IT
}p-\qk NOT for the effect of the internet drawing this ONE forward with
increasing speed, a victim of its own success?:Lkjfd;soire;l Always a
question of surveillance. I am to speak on postmodernity this coming
Tuesday. To what end? I will wear a dress a cloak a scabbard lksjdfll;sie
ru;lskj. I will be of _ready portend._ BUT THEN DISAPPEAR LIKE DREADS
LOCKED INTO LKJS;OE9584;SOI6T; T444;O9JH I'm not suitable to teach just
come in there like a curiosity piece OUTLKDSJOF DEPTH. I should be paid to
be looked at. Seriously, I can predict the future with pefect accuracy. I
don't doubt this for a minute and I'll be dead ;49o58;lkjdfjdskl within
the year.lkjf
