The Twenty-Six





If I have one point to make, it is only that we remain beholden to the 

twenty-six and their variants. That images of orphaned parents stand at 

the threshold of our thinking. That no one is comfortable with pain. That 

there are limited stories, that stories have their logics, that we play 

them out. That stories are orphans, beholden to the parents, thrust 

against the repetition of the twenty-six. 



That speech carries the weight of the world, mouths move armament. That 

no excuse is excuse. That the twenty-six are pilloried by the events of 

this and other worlds. That the worlds are filled with noise fluttering 

the twenty-six. That noise is not chaos, that worlds are underdetermined.



That logic never necessitates the impingement of the point. That "of 

course" follows its own course. That "gods have no hands."
