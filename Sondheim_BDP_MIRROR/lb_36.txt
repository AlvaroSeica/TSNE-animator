(image i, ecstasy)

this is the text that accompanies the image. this is the image that floats
the head against her dreams, but this is not a dream image. this is the
image that is real, that haunts across cyberspace, that requires the
digital to explicate the analog. do not forget, my friends, the analog,
the wave or field, in the midst of the particle, the shuddering of margins
irreducible. do not forget the sky, those places seen out of the corner of
your eye, moments of ecstasy, angels walking along curbside, always
already on the verge of disappearance. i would know disappearance,
embedded images in the text of the real, just as this is embedded text in
the image of the real, already textualized, high and keening notes, you
would forgive me, these are real tears, the weeping of the physical. do
not forget the angels, who surround you, multitudes whose diffraction do
make a shimmer when the sun peels itself against the sky. oh that air
shapes within air, you can imagine wars and harrows there, imagine the
embedded sky. when the sky is within the sky, i will come to you, broken
into digital, reformed once more, when the sky's within the sky. they were
right in the hearing, we, in their listening, listen, and 'this is the
text that accompanies the image, and this is the image that floats'

(image iii, sky)
