so i've got new antibiotics in me and there's no pain at all, but my ear
buzzing - tinnitus - is louder than ever, and i'm feeling muffled, as if
oxygen were cut off, poisons oozing out of every pore, eyes bleary and un-
focused. i'm halfway back into the womb; the outer world which i have i-
dentified as a _room,_ asserts itself as dangerouly uncomfortable - chills
and heartburns and odors. my dreams have more clarity than this; the mind
runs riot when the body cuts lose. when i die i'll see and understand
everything and i'll have a telephone in my cremation jar just like houdini
so i can call you and give you the understanding. no, i can do that now,
as a result of my condition. it's simply neti neti or another way of
thinking about it is that life interferes with the absolute meaningless-
ness and aimlessness of the universe, but not for much, and not for long.
right now i feel as if filthy pillows were surrounding my skull. in war-
rior zen there was a one-word sutra and a no-word sutra. this is far too
much of a no-sutra word. alan is my name.
