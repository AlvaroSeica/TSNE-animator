  2_working on the images, there are backgrounds, turning men and women
  3_into the ordinary. i will let these stand, recuperating the truth
  4_of the photograph - or i will fill these spaces, producing the body
  5_out of the hollow of the real. then there is the body and the body.
  6_it reflects universal suns and moons, the topography of space itself. 
  7_it does that. do i dissolve faces, substituting the memory of my own?
  8_are fingers extended, thrust into succumbing flesh, through breast,
  9_abdomen, the planar convolutions of the back? i think of the penis
 10_between nipples, duplicating the other, so close to the mouth of the
 11_subject, almost his speech. the body is lost in the swirl of flesh
 12_co-extensive with hollows into which it is no longer placed, but 
 13_transforms into a membrane suspended and productive. i do not send 
 14_the brush over nipples, labia, the curve of the penis itself; these
 15_survey the rest as i lose my face and sleep among them.
 16_ it is not anonymity or the purity of faceless bodies that i search
 17_ for, only the anonymity of the real itself. faces may drag the body
 18_ down; i would walk among you masked, in full masquerade, and naked
 19_ otherwise, were that not also a signifier of danger, abject depravity
 20_ - were that not also the opposite of anonymity, _the masked._
 21_i would crawl into my limbs, retract them, entangle them with yours,
 22_there would be no thought, there would be the comfort of the perfect 
 23_bed and our presences always among us. i beg to be a thing, among
 24_the things of my creation, photographs altered into sheaves of files,
 25_files resonant with a truth held by shattered cameras only. my labia
 26_couple with yours; breast to breast, milks flood our bodies; my penis
 27_opens to the whole wide world; vaginas cover arms and legs; hair falls
 28_through the world, entangling the other side. 
 29_ i will continue to modify us just _now_ with effects and filters.
 30_ stop me from thinking, stop me from thinking, stop me.
