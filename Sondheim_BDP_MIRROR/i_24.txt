Internet Questions



Where can I find an mpeg viewer that doesn't require a videoboard? Are

soundboards really necessary for all audio applications? Is Eudora

superior to Pine or the other way around? Why doesn't the Pico editor

allow me to jump to the end of a file? Is there any reason to download

linux to a home computer? What's a good telnet application for Trumpet

Winsock? Where does the name Trumpet Winsock come from? What is the

difference in download time for Mosaic and Netscape? What is the

difference between Netscape 1.1 and 1.2 beta? What is an AVI file and are

there AVI readers and if so, can they run without a videoboard? Does

anyone know the current legal status of gif? Is there a way to move into

the interior of a gif file and edit it directly? Can someone recommend a

decent uuencoder and uudecoder for DOS? 



Internet Securities



I worry about the tenuous nature of email lists in relation to the invest-

ment made in them by numerous subscribers. For this reason, I think it

worthwhile that all of us download the subscriber lists every so often, so

that if there is a disk crash or the necessity of setting up elsewhere,

the list could be reconstituted. To obtain the list, of course, write to

majordomo@jefferson.village.virginia.edu and say, in the body of the post,

who cybermind or who fiction-of-philosophy; once you have the list,

download and save. If the list goes down permanently, in the event of war

or other international catastrophe, create an alias file in your address-

book, and place the list there; enter it at the Bcc: option when sending 

out a post. To access Bcc: in Pine, when your cursor is in the header, 

type ^R, control-R and the rich-header will appear. Although it may 

appear that I am being facetious, I have learned in my short life not to 

trust the world.
