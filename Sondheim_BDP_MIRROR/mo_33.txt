too many things clutter the scene

the scene exfoliates on each and every thing

every thing moves from wounded cylinders

every thing moves to healed cylinders

some things are called retaining worlds

worlds and things are filled with churning waters

waters move everywhere 

there is nothing to stop the waters

the waters go in every direction

on and in the objects, the waters going and moving

only the waters seeing the waters
