Laurie -



I finally got your reply and liked your post, so thought I would tell you 

that Panix, at least part of it, is up and running again. I think a lot 

about the past, and always had; I wrote something once about clutter and 

its relation to miniscule histories - a scrap of paper floating by 

outside, and so forth. It's this alterity that I think is the most 

radical devouring, literally eating-out, of culture - this continuous 

facing of unknown pasts, which themselves are obliterated, fragmented. 

Clutter and garbage are the choking, fractalization of time, the elimina- 

tion of site or the stability of language - I'd almost say that these 

characterize the crisis of capital itself, the headlong rush into an 

extrapolated future. 



A styrofoam cup is used once; formed ultimately from oiled soup that may 

or may not signal the originary debris of life, it appears as the result 

of unknown manufacturing processes and sites, slathered through multiple 

distributions, to pass as scarcely visible or transitive across the body 

of the user, almost immediately discarded. No names are attached, 

nothing; if we could understand the phenomenology of the cup, we would 

understand our culture. But the phenomenology itself is disrupted, 

broken, and we're left, literally, hanging, suspended in time, only death 

a certainty somewhere along the plane (no longer along the line).
