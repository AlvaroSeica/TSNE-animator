listen, there's this woman who is writing me: so that if thinking were
ruptured conversation: listen, there's this woman I dream about: so that
if thinking were assemblage-floods, part-objects, annealings--everything
in this space forced into the verbal: listen, you should hear how she
whispers to me on the telephone; listen, you should hear how she writes
whisper whisper to me everywhere on the screen: if it is passed over by
silence, it does not exist: if it is spoken, it is brought forward, a
calling into existence, listen!: listen, there is this woman beside me,
beautiful conversations throughout the day and night, sometime we are very
silent: what is consigned to silence is annihilated--listen! what do you
hear of this woman who is beside me, this woman who carries a gun? so much
is lost in the silence, so much isn't language, so much chokes the mouth,
the eyes!: listen! this woman with dark hair, dark eyes, this woman of
fervour, this woman of deserts and blood: listen!
