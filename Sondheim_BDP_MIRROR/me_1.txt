Azure writes on the blackboard. The blackboard is dirty white.

She writes "Anthrax." She tries to erase it. It turns dark but is still 
visible. It doesn't disappear.

She wipes her hand across the board. She turns her hand up: white, 
powdered.

She turns back to the board. She writes "Territory" in block letters. She 
begins to erase it.

Azure lies naked with a French apron on a bench. She turns slowly.
Beethoven plays in the background. She says "This is a film about
anthrax."

Alan lies naked similarly, Beethoven. He says "Anthrax is deadly."

There are screen shots of a Sony Viao; Beethoven comes from the speakers.

Azure sits naked on the bench; her legs are spread. She talks about the 
dangers of Anthrax. The French apron is pulled up.

Alan, similarly.

Sometimes there is Beethoven in the background.

A closeup of Azure's breast, squeezed by Alan's hand with his voiceover:
"Anthrax is everywhere."

A closeup of Alan's penis, pulled by Azure's hand with her voiceover: "One 
has to be constantly careful." The penis begins to harden.

Azure masturbating on a couch. She says "Anthrax is dangerous. Be careful 
what you touch."

A closeup of a Sony Viao. There are patterns on the screen. Beethoven is 
playing.

sick


i am a sick man; i worry constantly that i am dying. my cholesterol is out
of control; i cannot find a doctor. heartburn is so bad i am debilitated
and often cannot function. i am off medication. i cannot sleep; tonight
again is a night full of nightmare and internal violence. it gnaws at me.  
it produces my writing. it inhabits my videos. it crawls up my body. i
live with death. i know i will not live long. my brain has been acting up
- the left frontal lobe again. tinnitus has returned with a vengeance; i
hear you only through a high-pitched wine. it is hard to focus on anything
- sleeplessness leaves me nervous and irritable. i cry at the slightest
provocation; try me. my philosophy lives at the edge of my mind. there is
nothing but limit within me; i am striated. when i open my eyes the world
is an irregular grid. i am close to hysteria.

some one of these posts will be my last. i can feel it in my body. i can
feel it in my flesh. the absence... it will be a dropping-away; it will
take time. then you will know it's gone - the writing - the nervous tremb-
ling - the texts - the luridness - the philosophy of no-name. at that
point nothing will matter; the fadeout is endurable; the work drops out,
fades out. look: there are almost no books, no readings, no citations, no
presence. a skein within a skein - the residue of a blemish on the web.
but nothing outside of it - the work is dead. "chances are you have not
read this far." if you have you're one of four or five.

death: i feel it in my bones. i feel the crystals. i feel the cry of the
letters. death shakes them out.

"The Runaway"


	Once, in a small town in Ohio, there was a girl with a pierced 
tongue. She pierced her tongue in defiance of her parents. She was 
unpopular in high-school and hung out with a few punks who tolerated her. 
She was good with computers and even better with the old pinball machines 
you could find at the One-Up. She was the star of Fighting Predator and 
her hands were quick. She had black hair and spoke in an affected drawl.
	A guy came to town with his parents. He was enrolled in the same
high-school. People said he was a loner. He couldn't stand the place. He
had come from a big city. His father was manager of the factory here. The
guy hated the small-town ways. He was shunned. Once he was beat up for his
lip. He also had black hair and earrings. Some kids tore them out and his
ears bled for a while. His eyes just grew darker and more terrifying,
especially for those who were scared.
	The two of them met. It was fated everyone said. They glared out 
at the world. They ran away together. They were seen going west from the 
town on the main highway. Some people said they were seen going east. No 
one could agree. One day people woke in the morning and they were gone. 
They were remarkable and the town talked about them for a long time. Then 
they were forgotten except for a few kids at the high-school. Life 
returned to normal. People felt better about things.

Jabes (trans. Waldrop):


"For all my being bound to the French language, I know the place I occupy 
in the literature of France is not strictly speaking a place. It is not so 
much the place of a writer as of a book which does not fit any category. A 
place defined, then, by the book and immediately claimed by the book to 
follow. A place of writing vacated by what is written, as if every page of 
the book let us occupy it only to give access to the next page, as if the 
book made and unmade itself in an appropriated space which, once covered 
with words, becomes the space of the book.

"And it is likewise within the large movement which has carried my works 
to their illusory completion.

"There is no center. There is a point which engenders another point around 
which an eccentric utterance establishes itself, an interrogation 
develops. It is the point of no return.

"This absence of place, as it were, I claim. It confirms that the book is 
my only habitat, the first and also the final. Place of a vaster non-place 
where I live."

This I identify with. Every text of mine, like the Net of Indra, reflects
every other. Each deals with, extends, the themes; the result, a family of
themes, never returns to an illusory origin. Each moves in a direction as
far as possible from the conception of a center. Each negates the tendency
towards an absolute, constructs skeins or membranes where others might
find ladders or stairs. The beds are tilted; the windows don't close, the
doors are always open. The night that is upon us is also the day; the day
has many suns. It doesn't stop there.

I close my eyes; I create the objects of which I claim witness. They smell 
of musk.
