I am Amaterasu. Please, describe yourself. Each time you are finished,
type RET twice.

truncated and dismembered body of shekinah across the land of israel
and palestine and shuddering she tries to rise and trembles falls again
broken and forgotten limbs her sex jerusalem legs in galilee
emanations from her face and mouth avatars from womb and hands
shuddered limbs trembled as if in memory of once her body concubline
wants upon the crevices of earth needs throughout tunnels of eilat
molten life and lost deaths great pools of wonder warm fluids swords
languages upon the eyes of hebron words upon the negev's shoulders
emotions as if emerging from the waters of babylon rivers of jericho
murmurs in the house of prayer floating arks high above sands and trees
higher and great rainbows arched across spring rains and shekinah
ululations and mournings heavens return to clouds and great grey mists
broken heavens almost peaked shekinah speaking of times and other times
women carrying themselves across the land broken land and healed women
broken shekinah and wounded men spears and lances swords and bible tracts
shekinah bible tracts words on fire black and white air and wounded men
return and shekinah and high and thin 
a single cloud of palestine and blue
white and burning black and burning skies stars thunders lightnings rain
and storms
off rains off storms shekinah speak broken broken lands and bible tracts
and  ah  ahh  ahhh  ahhhh  ahhhhh  and  ahhhhh  ahhhh  ahhh  ahh  ah

How do you reconcile perversions you have?
