Lucan, Pharsalia:





As soon as irrationals came into being, it was clear that everything

was exhausted and that nothing could be countered to be the same again.

For excess beneath the greatest scrutiny, bounded excess, excess 

uncontained, would never disappear, and each new discovery served to 

unharness the chariot of man.



Now it was never the numerical itself that was irrational, but the

attempt to contain number; it is not that we can dispense with Euclid

and Archimedes, but that they are to be surpassed, as a gorge itself

proves dangerous to wayfarers who seek a path towards the peak.



For Melissus says, _Being one, it must fail to possess a body. But if 

it had bulk it would have parts and would no longer be one._ (Cf. B 9.)

It is said that the breath has its inheritence.
