[16:49] There is no suitable surface to sit on, try another spot.
[2010/03/04 18:11] Flight Band: All Go
[2010/03/04 18:23] No room to sit here, try another spot.
[2010/03/06 09:00] Flight Band: All Go
[2010/03/08 22:26] sensor: noone around.
[2010/03/12 09:35] Alan Dojoji: 
Nikuko: Now we're going to discuss social philosophy.
Julu: The social philosophy of being online, the social philosophy of
being offline.
Nikuko: Social philosophy is always virtual.
Julu: Every word you say is virtual; words are not for eating.
[2010/03/12 09:36] Alan Dojoji: or of such in this new realm. or something 
in this new realm
[2010/03/12 09:36] Alan Dojoji: but it is this matter of inertia, never 
overlooking the usual concerns of primates and environments and then
[2010/03/12 09:36] Alan Dojoji: on the other hand, the situation of 
fragility as everything falls apart to be sure
[16:52] Alan Dojoji: Its difficult to describe this, yes? But the 
FUNDAMENTAL issue remains inertia, the ground-state of primate ecology, 
what works, what constitutes the preconscious habitus.
[16:52] Alan Dojoji: Every utopian vision ignores this; every manifesto 
assumes that behavior is modifiable on a scale well beyond that of taste 
or fashion.
[16:53] Alan Dojoji: I'd think otherwise, towards being constituted by 
what - UNconsciously is ascribed to essence.
[16:55] Alan Dojoji: Fragility comes into play only when deep-structure is 
obliterated by hegemonic forgetfulness, hegemony constituted by economic 
power, but also the power of media porosity, subjectivity bound to radio, 
packages of modernization, tv, net, and so forth.
[16:55] Alan Dojoji: In any order.
[16:56] Alan Dojoji: These lights in Second Life are blinding me...
[16:58] Alan Dojoji: If you think of the Thing in relation to depression, 
you might agree that the Thing is also inextricably entangled in the 
psychoanalytical-social. You might think that fragility is the result of 
an inability to bypass the thing, which inverts, transforms into the 
catatonic, simultaneously abjures and embraces substance. 0: or f(0) as an 
absorber
[16:59] Alan Dojoji: 1 or f(1) as embracer, but f(x) - perhaps an 
irrational - refusing position:
[16:59] Alan Dojoji: or position only by virtue of the CUT.
[17:01] Alan Dojoji: For the most part humans want to continue what 
they've always done, what amounts to what works or might have worked at a 
particular point in time. Or say (inexact) space-time region. What becomes 
custom, what inscribes: what inscribes is fixture, fetish, fixation.
[17:01] Alan Dojoji: What inscribes is the HARMONIC.
[17:02] Alan Dojoji: That is to say regulatory NODE.
[17:05] Alan Dojoji: One might think of the proper mode of BIRTHING or 
proper mode of DEATHING in this regard.
[17:06] Alan Dojoji: I am thinking of: in particular: issues of creation 
and cessation, but more importantly, issues of SPEW and SLAUGHTER.
[17:07] Alan Dojoji: For these abjure the HARMONIC.
[17:10] Alan Dojoji: They are THING. They transform organism into THING.
[17:10] Alan Dojoji: THING has no HISTORY.
[17:10] Alan Dojoji: They abjure HISTORY as well.
[17:12] Alan Dojoji: However, simultaneously they exist on the plane of 
inertia, through the process of compartmentalization. Slaughter occurs, 
but is set-aside as slaughter: but is set-aside. Productive spew fills 
interstices, transforms substance into substance, but is set-aside.
[17:12] Alan Dojoji: One carries the FRAGILITY of the self into slaughter.
[17:13] Alan Dojoji: One swallows the FRAGILITY of the self in the 
excretion of spews.
[17:13] Alan Dojoji: Let it be said: We are all diseased.
[17:14] Alan Dojoji: Our inertia is that of culture production radically 
disconnected, signified and commodified; body inscription becomes the 
inscriptive body.
[17:15] Alan Dojoji: Use-value is inertial; exchange-value, fragile. Which 
is more deeply embedded in time?
[17:16] Alan Dojoji: To be sure, the inertial, which conserves time, 
hoards time, exists outside of time.
[17:16] Alan Dojoji: One overturns fragility with RAGE.
[17:17] Alan Dojoji: RAGE decomposes, INERTIA composes; one overturns 
inertia with the decomposition of fragility.
[17:18] Alan Dojoji: What is fragile rarely produces GOOD THINGS; the rest 
is CATASTROPHE, catastrophe theory.
[17:18] Alan Dojoji: The CATASTROPHIC is the unspoken of INSCRIPTION.
[17:19] Alan Dojoji: There are no silent partners.
[17:20] Flight Band: All Go
[17:21] Alan Dojoji: I will escape thee.
[17:23] Alan Dojoji: I will break the skin of INSCRIPTIVE PREDESTINATION
[17:23] Alan Dojoji: I will find the INCOHERENT in the INERTIAL
[17:23] Alan Dojoji: All of this I will transform and more.
[17:24] Alan Dojoji: Your THING is my REGARD.
[17:25] Nikuko: Your REGARD is my THING.
[17:25] Julu: My THING exactly.
