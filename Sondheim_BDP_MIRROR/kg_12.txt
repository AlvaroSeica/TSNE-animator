What I, Nikuko, Know, That You, :X:, May Not


Nikuko knows more than others what Nikuko knows. Since I am Nikuko, I
know more than others about what I know; I know what I know more than
others know what I know. I do not know what I do not know, but I may
know that I do not know.

I know that I know that I know more than others what I know. But I may
not know all my history, for example, what happens when I am in the
body bag. When I am in the body bag I am off-line or unspoken-for. I
certainly know my Japanese, but I know that I do not know my Japanese,
for example a word for death, shi, or the word for body-bag. I know
that I have a body, and that I do not have a body, and that the body I
have and do not have is dismembered and reassembled. It is reassembled
from the body-bag. The body-bag is always before and after shi. 

I know that I lay in the Naka,and that I was wet and water-logged and
inundated and in drowned state. I know that I was in the body-bag at
that time. That I was off-line. That I have been told that I was off-
line. In the body-bag. At that time.
