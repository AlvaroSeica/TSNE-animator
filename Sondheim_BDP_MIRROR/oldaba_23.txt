     - rain falling in the rain program, open holes in pico manifesto

seething green meadows, brooks surged down black dirt and rocky slopes,

shattered planes, wings torn as they plunge, that silence screeched, 
nub of air cutting them in two. bodies vacate bodies. these are pure
event, nothing else happening in any way, cause has all but disappeared.
crowds gather in emptiness. deaths are always imminent, planes above
                            - acid rain, planes plunge through it.
