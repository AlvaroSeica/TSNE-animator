March 1995





Mayakovsky's trying to sleep. He's been on the telegraph the entire day 

with Lili. Lili's caught in a new revolt that hasn't made the papers yet 

and Mayakovsky can't sleep because he's in love with Lili and doesn't 

know where she is. He only knows she's on the other end of the wires. He 

knows that because he types 



I love you more than anyone has ever loved I 

	dream of you at night and I can't dream and I can't sleep 

		and she types back

			she types back 

I toss and turn there's no tomorrow no day and no night no yesterday 

	and no today 

		and there are sounds of keyboards thousands of kilometers 

apart in the white night of Russian March 

	almost into the flowering of the birch 

		and everywhere you go there are guns firing in the distance 

and Mayakovsky thinks they're for us he thinks they're for us 

	and Lili thousands of kilometers apart millions of kilometers apart

		she thinks Mayakovsky's sending me a message 

			sending a message 

				and neither of them can sleep
