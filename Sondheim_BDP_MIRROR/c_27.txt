I love you so much it hurts through the looking-glass!





Puppy love when your stomach dissolves and your beloved stretches 

across the sky, slowly floating down to earth, a silk feather, even in 

this space of "silk feather" floating across the streaked summer storm



Breasts, breasts



I've got butterflies there, I've got blueballs, I gotta bang come the 

rain come the thunder, gotta tie me up hold me down spread me open, gotta 

dress the dress



Gotta dress the wound gotta bandage the sky, honey, baby, lover, babe, 

Al, big Al, cutie-pie, snooky, roonie, Alwie, big guy



The territory of the signifier is _marked off._ Period. From the Pirke 

Avot: Make a hedge around the Torah. The intensification of the 

signifier, elsewhere, its dissolution. Period



Puppy love spread your legs, gotta suck you now, tongue your menses, 

transfusion of worlds upon worlds, Shekinah slowly floating down to 

earth, drenched silks everywhere



I wail and beat my little hands against the pillow, my tears flow like 

rivers I'm crying you sailing upon alone on a skiff, sucking my tit with 

my little mouth, sucking my nipple blue-black



Hold tight to the peepee, nothing will take me away from taking me away: 

The sails fill, rudder turns, bow rises, motor hums, captain sings, first 

mate smiles, second mate walks the plank



I'm not innocent! I'm not innocent! I cry, I've killed everyone! I've 

killed everyone! All the little butterflies!
