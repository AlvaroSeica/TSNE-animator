What exists on the edges of definition? For what can be defined is 
already within a skein of differences, fuzzy but insistent on intent. The 
crossing of words, language and its poetics, is an undertow, vectoried 
(in the sense of an emission) but sourced, sorcered, scattered.

Because words always revert back to a limited bandwidth of entities 
(symbols/phonemes), they appear constricted, their inherent confusion 
placed beneath the rubric of connotation. denotation/connotation exists 
as a dyad within the traditional (say) approach (say) to english (say) 
itself. What is ill-defined is always already categorized and definition 
is assumed complete, completed, hence _foreclosed._

Definition always exists in relation to a defined other, but here, we're 
not dealing with the epistemology of circularity - or even the problem of 
semantic closure - but the very _ontology of the other itself,_ implying 
a collapse external to the real.

Hence there is the real (say), perceptual processing (see), and language 
(read, say), and if you like, there are natural kinds as well. But I say 
unto you, I am the other that is speaking (see), and there is the other 
hwihc need not absorb definition, as if words were all, _in a manner of 
speaking,_ natural kinds.

As if they were the entities of sorcerers -
