ATTACK on CRAZY JANE TALKS WITH THE BISHOP by WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS


What an idiot Bishop! I met the Bishop on the road He should be in church!
Shut him up, evil church! And much said he and I. He talks too much!
Guilty of ageism! 'Those breasts are flat and fallen now, Sexless Bishop!
Just for children, eh! Those veins must soon be dry; Stop looking!
Sure he didn't say that! Live in a heavenly mansion, Where he gropes you!
Liar, liar, you wouldn't know! Not in some foul sty.' Beauty, beauty!

True, but shut him up! 'Fair and foul are near of kin, Yeats is also foul!
The poet's in love! And fair needs foul,' I cried. Liar! He denies it!
Oh yeah, shut up Yeats! 'My friends are gone, but that's a truth (Lie!)
Depression and love, eh? Nor grave nor bed denied, Forget Donne, Yeats!
Idiot! Raise the body! Learned in bodily lowliness Don't screw with it!
Give her your heart! And in the heart's pride. Why not! She struggled!

Yeah, don't generalize! 'A woman can be proud and stiff Written by a man! 
Men need women more than women need men! When on love intent; Admit it! 
Back to the mansion again! But Love has pitched his mansion in Anal sex! 
So what! The place of excrement; You can't face it, Yeats, can you? 
What about the Man! For nothing can be sole or whole He's broken in two! 
More parts, three! That has not been rent.' Liar, broken Man, idiot!
