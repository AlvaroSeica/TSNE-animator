Mystical Text on Mourning in Cyberspace





How private is mourning? Death fulfills the body's margins, siphons

rites into the central



Inscription makes the graveyard shift. At night, illuminated 

letters exist,* Torah-moths fluttering against the spaces of dark

wood, hair-thin wires connecting desk to floor to universe



Beyond is always a beckoning to which the text responds



The text flees the grave. The wires are copper-red, lacquered, slight

warmth in the snow of their environs. Across the snow, gaps appear,

shudder, recovered by falling stars, white and glistening beneath the

moon. The gaps stutter the snow, lines carrying the yellow letters

upon them, frozen over, white and glistening



Beckoning draws truth's absence against the dawn and I tell you, here

lies the truth of the letters, snows, Torah, stars, moths and darkness 

of space



Across the room, the terminal is silent and cold, no cyberspace,

nothing of the speaking of the year or century



* And so, too, vermin and creeping things and all things have their

supernal forms, as I have previously expounded this wondrous topic.

In its great brilliance, this illumination pushes away, at first, the

other illuminations but then brings them near again by its great

power, attracting them by its abundant splendor. 

(14th century, Abraham of Granada.)





	The space the child rocks

	The cradle past the stone -

	Absence always mocks

	God is on her throne



	The space of God's dark bone

	Speaks and makes a space

	Which grows and dies alone

	For sorrow has no face -



	Nor God a body now 

	Nor speech the sound of voice -

	No prayer beseeched of love -

	No elements rejoice -



	For speech will sing of death -

	And death will have a space 

	Which mourns a speaking's breath

	And dies, and so does place -



(Emily Dickinson, 1830)
