American Tabloid





I figured I'd finish American Tabloid flying out of Los Angeles back down

to New York but didn't figure I'd finish it here in the city at 5 am in

the morning. LA-lala was Net all the way, nodes and penetrations, trans-

parencies among sites, channeled flows down freeways across homeowners'

firewalled fences designed to protect cordoned neighborhoods from _them_

- oh but you know all that. 



But American Tabloid by James Ellroy doubled the stakes/Net imaginary:

Corruption is everywhere within it, sites are always already imminent, 

passion rains terror and ecstasy. But it is a mystery or a story with no

surprises, which is the trajectory of the real, or rather what is a sur-

prise to the characters is no surprise to us; we know where Kennedy was

shot before they do for example.



And it's a deeper analysis for all Ellroy's real-life bluster, of simul-

ac America, than Baudrillard could ever produce - deeper because of the

deaths and drugs involved and the sheer interiority of bodies. And the 

sites, Netted landscape more cyber for all its street-transport, than 

Gibson, I think because of the uneasy quality there and available. Right

now outside the fireworks are turning violent; it's Fourth of July, ready

or not for example.



That's why we get along in this space - because for those of us in the

States, it's already familiar - only you can't get AIDS or killed through

the screen, yet. We're becoming a nation of posturers, sweeping people of

color aside as quickly as possible as the Rehnquist Supreme Court returns

to the post-reconstruction era and its segregation clampdown. We'll see

what we want and see only at a distance.



And try as hard as we can, distance is something that comes with the Net,

only we're on the other side, trying to get in.



Trying to _get real._ Or as real as Ellroy's book.
