LEXICON TEXTBOOK OF THINKING


Reading is the orientation of the world to the work, where the energy
goes, what the eye engages, the alphabetic baseline of the world, we all
go through this, we all understand it - this world, this baseline - so
that the letters - so that the letters - this _devouring_ - Recognitions
passed by swiftly, silently - recognitions effaced, one after another,
this or that quantity - this or that substance quietly fissuring - You can
hear it boil, boiling - And so where the _energy goes_ is into this init-
iation, alleviated, but not entirely - this alphabetic initiation always
at the margins - the turmoil of the horizon - We have at least this in
common, these moments, these things in common...

book of thinking, in idle conversation or in the fictitious heated passion
of the night."
