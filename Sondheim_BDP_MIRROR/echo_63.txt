name is nikuko; I'm forlorn. I can't do anything here in the portal. I

can't leave the portal, I can't return to the portal. "The Portal is my

Enemy." I'm tired of roaming these halls. I'm back in the portal. I'm back

in the Portal. I can't say anything through my hands; labor eats away my

hands; I hunger for your hands; my mouth speaks through my hands; my mouth

carries the sweat of my blood; blood spurts from my hands; I carry your

signs upon me; jennifer! jennifer! .l .g hall .rev .g portal .g portal .g
