 

thus at the limits of explanation,

the _draw distance_ is beyond the avatar, stutters, operates within range, 
stumbles, moves, redefines position, filters objects in the whole wide 
world, strobes backgrounds, flashes objects, drains seas, cauterizes 
skins, retrieves supplements, performs in the absence of performances, 
dancing the virtual. the inherent plasticity of virtual worlds, sheaves 
cutting through psychologically apparent phenomena, is evident in deep 
phenomenological illegibility. the sense of logos, encoded, recuperable, 
aristotelian or quantum, is fundamentally shattered. what might have been 
considered primordial turns on confusion. ultimately nothing gets through 
the ground which may be abandoned. what occurs is a form of shepherding or 
collusion of affect; it's just those ways. beyond all of this, one would 
need access to the database itself, as if decoding were possible, and as 
if that possibility turned further into a clarity of mind.
