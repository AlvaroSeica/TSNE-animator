still of the Nuit


"I was and probably still will going to write something about this as well
- odd - using Maxwell's Demon to imply the impossible separation and or-
dering of scripts..." so I wrote to Clara Nuit in relation to the entrance
of the Demon, separating hot and cold molecules, separating hot and cold
scripts, what would happen - so that the _dramatic-script boy_ carries a
bundle! and _the continuity girl_ ensures that one follows another with a
modicum of etiquette and something that might be called _the least concern
of all._ So I wrote this, I, Daishin Nikuko, _in relation to the continu-
ity girl,_ hoping that she, as well as Clara Nuit, would read this, as one
script among many: consider then an intervention
                             \ /
                              V
from elsewhere, a stylus inscribing, delimiting, articulating a series or
sheaf of texts or scripts, the Demon hard at work, Satan at the keyboard,
writing all of us into existence, toppling into _this_ form, font, and
style: consider then an enabling
                              A
                             / \
as if balancing the w/hole, the effluvia or debris of the world - _the
continuity girl_ half hysterical with a task moving quickly out of hand -
_dramatic-script boy_ almost collapsing under the weight of proliferating
scripts ...

Maxwell faltering in his impossible task by the way side, reality carrying
on ...
