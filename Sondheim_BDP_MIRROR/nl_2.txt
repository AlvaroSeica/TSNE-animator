collaboration

la the enemy, espionage, each reading the other, of public arrive at
everything through collaboration, discussion, lb you'd be surprised
collaborative work series into a hypertext collaboration  list or
co moderate or begin or end collaborations    inside of me it /*in*/
where i work alone  i collaborate badly  i bristle  my thoughts 
lc among my jews, collaboration
     ld among my jews, collaboration
   prolegomena   against collaboration  
   collaboration  take it or leave it  
   collaboration  take it or be taken  
   the violence of collaboration  
   collaboration as 'grappling'  
   collaboration with the enemy  
   because one is a collaborator and one's hair is   
   a role is  always  a collaboration  
   in the sense of  collaboration with the enemy  
   collaborative exchange is void of value  
   value in its limits
   the emptiness of collaboration   pure labor  
   collaboration is always better than working  
   collaboration sublimates   subsumes   desire  
   structured collaboration has its limits  
   indeed, this is collaboration with the enemy  

collision collusion maybe collaboration maybe colloidal
collaboration
collaboration between two dying writers
collaboration on the lam from the law
collaboration marching from kosovo
collaboration wounded in east timor
collaboration of iraqi dead
collaboration beneath earthquake
in free fire zone, collaboration
in mountain fire zone, collaboration
collaboration among prisoners
collaboration between rival gangs
the last breath, you against the light, collaborating
collaborating with friends
collaborating with the enemy
to collaborate among the ruins of the atomic bomb
insistent on the lyric after auschwitz, collaboration
among my jews, collaboration
among my neo nazis, collaboration
collaboration in the last words ever spoken
collaboration among the last tears, the last sigh
collaboration at a loss for words
war time and collaboration
and of great beauty and moons wheeling, collaboration

 s the book really dead  
another world,  'd love to collaborate with you on a creative work where
its precisely because other people are setting up the collaborative 
making substitutions all over the place,   and   have collaborated 
                                         i     i

chorus

http://www.asondheim.org/chorus.mov

the silent chorus moves quickly through the shuttle
we all behave the same with ropes and signs
swollen and melting are one and the same
the stars in their degrees distend the body
your place or mine your death or mine
watch this very short film 
you will live inside it with everything you are

the 5d


http://www.asondheim.org/5.mov

what was some separate images and aren't
i'm too ill but these use time jittering with echo and posterize
from four to five but it's all lies
mathematics isn't mathematics is the only truth
representation is an other thing all together

ruined.mov and DANCERUN.MPG are going down soon so please get to them 
quickly

you won't regret it

butterfly fugue

http://www.asondheim.org/deathfugue.mov

this is the mating that triggered the war that killed all the people
the silent wings stirring up anguish, no one can take the blame
we are all innocent in our lives, we are all wounded
we will not eat we will live to do as much injury as possible
we will bring everyone to their knees, how dare they
we are the fury of the righteous and the violence of the lord
we are christ's burning, yahweh's drowning, allah's stoning
how dare we speak in the name of the truth
we are the murderers' fire and water and stone
one with annihilation
one with the world
