my obsessive responsibility of production
withdrawal into machinic constructs, but:

remember: when the apocalypse arrives:
 i have warned ye
 i have given ye notice
 i have described the slaughter
 i have given in exempla:
  the horror and pain
  the sense of hopelessness
  the feeling that everything has gone wrong

---

when 1 shows up 0 is slaughtered
when 0 shows up there is horror and pain
1(0) and 0(1) hopelessness
everything has gone wrong

'this machine kills fascists'
cross-post my work far and wide.

don't ever say i didn't warn you.
don't ever say i don't feel the apocalypse 
internally day after day.
the apocalypse is in my bones.
the destruction is now.
when you are in flames and drowning, remember this.
when you hear the sirens, remember this.
i warned you and i warned you not to destroy me.
you didn't listen and that's why you're where you are today.

don't think that is this when this is this.
don't think that was the beginning.

juarez mud ruins and
i tried to resurrect this
crossing the river illegally for a better money land
http://www.asondheim.org/juarezmudruin.mov
there was a video but it was battering in the camera
back and forth furiously but these stills
came from the ruined video as if it were today or yesterday
it was ten years ago in juarez ten years ago in el paso
juarez was free and el paso was dangerous and furious
or el paso was free and dangerous, juarez furious
and they were crossing the river and there were empty lands
and we photographed the empty lands and looked into them
and into radiations and their routes of radiotelevision
so there's this and that this remnant
so there's this and that this remnant
we're the empire that made it happen
it's always like this and the sound is lost as well
someday i'll tell you a story
someday you'll listen to my confusion

Suicidal Thoughts


Last night watched American Splendor about Harvey Pekar and was struck 
with uselessness. My domain name was renewed in the nick of time. Kerry is 
behind by nine points as state after state swings towards the fascists, 
with the so-called electoral vote 28 points ahead for Bush Inc. I had a 
growth removed from my face being tested for malignancy. I've gone off 
lexapro and feel dizzy pretty much all the time but so far nothing else. 
The horror of beheadings as we're "winning in Iraq." I don't sleep 
anymore. I can't lose weight. So much net art is rehashed conceptualism 
from the 60s and 70s. Doesn't the country _get it_? No one replies to my 
work at all, at this point. Discussion on Poetics about "erasure." 
Argentina? I've used the technique at least since 1976 in those poetics 
programs I wrote. A fourth hurricane heading for Florida and people still 
develop the Everglades, now at 9% what it was. The roof of this building 
is cracked and we'll have to move out for a while when it's replaced. 
Boojum, our cat, is checked now daily for a resurgence of cancer; we can't 
tell. The crazy guy on our block now has a pit bull. More trees are dying 
and more pit bulls are sprouting. Our friends had to get rid of their 
rooftop garden because of an "error." Sharona's leaving Monk because of 
"creative differences" or some such. It's getting harder to breathe around 
here. Whatever Bush says, goes. We're really broke at this point and as 
usual I feel at odds and somewhat alienated from most of my family. At 
sixty-one the body begins to whisper failure. I'm absolutely certain there 
is no god, spirit, soul, though I was destined to believe otherwise. Every 
organized religion murders. On one level, the murders of Russian children 
are inconceivable; on the other, they're part of the daily routine. First 
the mudslides and floods, then the drowning, then the looting and fury. 
Get rid of your vegetation and everything sinks in the sea. Human animals 
are by far the filthiest; look at the New York subway stations. TV Guide 
no longer lists late late night at all. Every day there are new scams in 
the email, targeting the weakest among us. Most of these are completely 
illegal. Reality shows along the line of Survivor seem to delight in 
animal-torture; where is Peta? Even the SPCA? During the Republican 
convention here, half a million took to the streets, and there were online 
and other offline actions as well. The result, a fascist popularity 
landslide. Medication is pricing the elderly out of existence. Another 
Ramone died. Madonna's Kabbalah is idiotic and insulting. I've been 
sleeping far too much as a result of depression; getting off the lexapro 
should help. A psychiatrist friend suggested I use "bubblegum" as a 
mantra. SUV usage has gone up 45% in most places here and I gather the 
Hummer gets 7 miles to the gallon. Our place is overrun with mice who 
freely eat from our humane traps. The cat watches. There are some flies as 
well. I'm not playing enough music and have somewhat lost my embrochure. 
I'm hopefully selling some rare books to raise some money as my father 
yells at me that they're not worth much. The dark night of the soul is 3 
p.m. in the afternoon. Someday I'll be thrown in the jail for disbelief. 
It's increasingly hard to work on texts in absolute silence. My friends 
are all in academics; I sit here at the desk and hunger for a living. I 
still haven't gotten over the death of my mother and my father's dislike 
of me. We're living on Azure's school loans and my occasional work or 
lecturing. My headaches have increased in frequency and severity over the 
past several months. How can anyone claim Afghanistan or Iraq are 
successes? This is no longer my country and the net is no longer "my" net; 
both belong to the spammers. Frances, Ivan, Charley, Jeanne. Our 
neighborhood is being redeveloped and across Flatbush, buildings will be 
seized by "eminent domain." I head someone else leaped from a building at 
NYU, Azure's university. My Sony Hi8 with PCM sound won't sync tapes 
properly and I'm in danger of losing another ten years' work. The 
Susquehanna river in Pennsylvania, where my father lives, rose to within 
three feet of overflowing the dikes. I get tired of arguments about 
cross-posting, but on the other hand, am almost never invited to read. I 
get tired of arguments about "avant-garde" and "experimental" writing, 
when clearly something new is happening and people are too blind to see 
it. Was it Louisiana that just approved of a state-constitutional ban on 
same-sex marriages? For the first time in decades, we're insisting on the 
instituting of privilege and prejudice. Full-fledged legal racism and 
anti-semitism are not far behind. This country is white, right-wing, 
Christian, and by God, patriotic; don't let anyone tell you different. I'm 
more afraid of Bush than Ben Laden. Who wants to hear a 61-year-old 
guitar/shamisen player anyway? Let's watch Jerusalem burn. I'm worried the 
mice will eat the bellows of the pump organ. I feel death breathing down 
my back, illuminating the pain in my early-morning eyes. Why isn't there 
terrorism directed at the fascists in power? I worry my friends won't be 
able to tolerate me. We can't keep dust out of this place and live in 
constant allergic reaction. My astigmatic eyes have trouble focusing 
properly and if I don't consciously correct, my digital photographs come 
out at a 3-degree tilt. About twice a month I have to call 911 for the 
neighborhood. The sink pipes blew out a couple of weeks ago. We're in 
incredible debt, for the first time in our lives. A saving grace would be 
a hard cold winter.

Hello everyone,

the stores storage stored storeroom storerom storeram
at http://www.asondheim.org/ all .bmp describing in our midst
ecological/biological/digital storage of the year 2050.

I request politely that you go and investigate these remarkable
images of the future and their precision of description.

Certainly we should be aware, at this juncture in time of

among other attempts at optico-magneto-quantum storage units
available in mass supply by 2014.

Thank you very much for your consideration of these units.

I hope they will give you considerable pleasure in meditation
on their uncanny beauty and even more uncanny states.

what happens in the spare time of human individual being objects
http://www.asondheim.org/fuck.mp4
http://www.asondheim.org/suck.mp4
some such

_


some sort of phenomenology

of the work of hacking and motion-capture in relation to codework
and mywork:

. palimpsest and interweavings
. gatherings around subterranean tokens
. the Wager of the devolution of the natural
which does not hold; the natural excretes, oozes, destroyed by the 
cleansed proper body. the worst mistake is the subsummation of the 
natural beneath the belly of the technological and the efflorescence
of extinctions that results.
. code as Barrier throughout the world, the operative of code as
distancing, defoliation replacing Vietnam napalm-burn. code destroys
one world, opens another; one always has the attributes of negation
to ensure compliance. with what? with the subject, subjectivity-at-a-
distance.
.Hegel and the porosity of the world
as the physics of the word increasingly turn towards the porous; it's
not hacking by one in relation to the other, but the culture hacked
itself, self-hacked, hacking resonance and harmonics, the hacking of
the hacked (already opened up by O'Reilly's series); in other words,
no privacy, no security, the interweaving of infiltration and
filtration.
. the Plasma neutral
and the plasmatic world, world of the Plasmatics, plasma as standard
states of matter, (un)stated matter, hacking software hacked to soft
hacking, absolute loss of information, fast-forward thought and its
loss.
. momentary negations x^~x -> 0(x)
the null set relative to x-semantics, thus neither x nor not-x but 
x-sememe, negation carried through to the other
as x and not-x are venn-separated by inscription relative to (x, not-x), 
but x-semantics/sememe "has something to do with it" - so we consider 
porosity as those state which "have something to do with things" or 
with the configuration, constructibility of things or entities, see
http://www.asondheim.org/statepositive.png
http://www.asondheim.org/statenegative.jpg
. palimpsest and interweavings gatherings
beginning thinking about soft-weavings.
. around subterranean tokens the Wager of the devolution of the natural 
code
which is also the waver of the world strewn with entities, in constant
states of withdrawal, maintenance and cleansing
. here against the waver-Wager is where words begin to fail, so does
perceptual organization, some sort of phenomenology (codework breaking,
or the slough of the symbol
. symbolic slough
organization of difference is the origin of institutionalization,
non-deferral

tinnitus

Eleanor Thornton and Alan Sondheim both have tinnitus, continuous ringing 
in the ears. 

In this video, a highly sensitive microphone is placed between the two of 
them, recording the sound of mixed tinnitus.

Please turn your treble up full and your bass down to zero in order to 
hear this. For those with graphic equalizers, try full above 4k and 0 
otherwise. Thank you.

the uselessness of poems

                   
why would one write a poem . in a poem statements are
not to be taken at face value . everything is excused
. metaphors are always broken . the tropes are torpor
describe millennia ago . abstraction and codework or
oulipo tricks are those of dying form . to bear
witness implies the necessity of clear speech . the
language is already debased . nothing will bring it
back and we all know about the problematic of origins
. nothing stops the devolution of an increasingly 
minor art . there is no reason whatsoever to 
teach poetry in the school system . today the 
average nursery-rhyme, already antiquated, says 
more about culture and cultural context than any 
contemporary poet . poetics is the last refuge of 
the damned, always involved in recuperation . the 
code-forms of traditional poetry are permanently 
lost in the virtual digital and dawning world . 
statements in poems are always already hyperbole 
. to speak to each other is to speak to no one . 
the poetry slam at least has the virtue of 
contestation . poems are fearful of the world . 
the contemporary world is all we have . the last 
place one looks for testimony is the poem . the 
poetry of previous centuries envelops us like 
good late-night television . the condensation of 
kennings and waka is destroyed by the infinity of 
digital type . poet on one hand, rockhop on the 
other as we go out singing . don't mistake 
content . cleverness is the last refuge of the 
poet . happy poems make good times of us all . 
what at this point is the point of searching for 
the word . i begin to write a poem: i sit at a 
tablet in a certain position . language swirls in 
the absence of content . the world demands 
nothing of the poet . writers, no readers . with 
charm the poet fools the poet . the crashed world 
. we are our own victims of surplus . we are our 
own surplus victims .

personal bush


getting off of lexapro, sinister celexa, the dizziness becomes stronger 
the more i focus on it. it's not so much dizziness as a sudden _shifting_ 
as if the saccadic movements of the eyes skipped a beat. it's the shifting 
of the world, and it's accompanied by ill-forming short dreams, terror, 
and emotions close to the surface. tonight for example, the presence of my 
mother, dead over three years, was stronger than ever. i have a continuous 
memorial light burning here; when the lights are out, it flickers; when i 
shine a flashlight on it, it gains strength, sustenance, and burns 
continuously. i figured out this is a result of additional imported energy 
to the shell levels, but the result appears a miracle, one light feeding 
off another. meanwhile the early morning headaches grow worse, imminent 
behind the eyes. so you ask why i publish so much, cross-post? because of 
my fear of death gnawing at me; everything must be done and done 
immediately; there is no time to waste. i know if something isn't produced 
and distributed _now_ it will never be; that piece of the puzzle will be 
lost forever. it drives me. i'm obsessed with death and because of this 
obsession i can also speak to the president and his popularity - the 
reason became clear this evening, and sudden. it was in 2001 that my 
mother died; that 9/11 occurred; that i lost the job in miami; that i 
began taking celexa, the dextrous version of lexapro, full of immediate 
side-effects that made me flee. it was an enormous depression, a _thing_ 
as kristeva might say, and i associate this _thing_ - of depression, 
violence, death, of trauma - of post-traumatic shock syndrome - with both 
comfort and imprinting; one has reached the limit, and it's there that 
memory begins, holds fast, turns to long-term. imprinting inscribes and 
circumscribes the thing; it's misery, but it's encapsulated. and during 
our nation's weakest collective moment, with the towers falling, bush 
appeared, this violent, stupid man created out of sound-bites - and in 
that moment just a very few days later, standing in the rubble doing 
nothing but feeling heroic, he became part of us, forever associated with 
falling men and women, with the simultaneous moment of creation and 
annihilation. just as some of us remember the day kennedy was shot, or 
john lennon died, or 9/11 itself, so we remember the circumstance of the 
man and his masquerade, as they all are, of the phallus, upright in the 
ruins. and this imprinting occurred and still occurs within the chora, the 
region of drives (the hole in ground zero is referred to as the _bathtub_) 
- primordial, pre-linguistic, or the shuddered and stuttering beginnings 
of the gesture itself. it's within this imaginary that the image appears, 
that bush fumbles to the top, guarantees whatever safety, maternal and 
otherwise, there is in the world - it's not a question of policy or his 
incipient fascism - _it's not a question at all._ instead, it's a state, a 
condition, that of the moment of trauma associated with salvation and the 
proper name, beginnings of language from the always already ruined. bush 
is here, he's within us, and for many americans, this is a kind of 
salvation, ironically brought about in an unstable world bush himself is 
partially responsible for. the circuit closes in on itself, strangles. no 
wonder he's so far up in the polls, after failure after failure - the 
guarantees he offers aren't linguistic, ideological - they're the 
guarantees of presence itself, and presence references life, no matter how 
denuded.

in the meantime, it is another long night of memories rising to the top, 
of death breathing hard down the body, of a very real fear of attempted 
sleep and its onslaught and slaughter. i won't rise to the occasion; i'll 
fall to it, out of exhaustion. i'll be held and dropped, but at least i'll 
be alive.

Proof

'sneer' seems to have a space between s and n first line middle - the 
double arrow <--> doesn't read that way because of the type - can you use 
a symbol here? same on type line from bottom, every-thing change to 
everything can you change the italics of "in this sentence" to "_in this 
sentence_"? The underline would go better with the rest of the typography 
in this piece. line of type, please change "west" to "West" at the bottom 
of : "Am Ursprung gibts kein Plagiat" (Karl Kraus) - please if possible 
put this on the Dedication as well. maybe put "TERMI NAL" on a line by 
itself: TERMINAL from bottom - need parenthetical closure after "spatial" 
middle - you might want to use arrow symbols here as well very top of - 
since this is untitled, it seems a continuation of - maybe capitalize 
HONEY:> NOTHING WORKS IN THIS SPACE, - just that far, as indicative of a 
new piece. not sure but there seems a slight opening between lines and 
third line - please take out "(changed the name)" - it seems self-evident 
- rd paragraph, from third sentence - can we change to "Wild theory is 
pierced, penetrated. The piercings" - then include the rest of the 
paragraph. In other words, take out the ref. to grrrl theory. is a sonnet 
of lines plus . But here the justifying makes a bit of a mess of it. 
Perhaps you can run it sideways - some way to preserve the original lines? 
Smaller type? down about a third - change "oopback" to "loopback" - please 
note about / of the way down, where "Member name" and the next two lines 
are - they're misaligned, check the ms? Same near bottom where the 
____media____ and the next line is - they should be on the same line - 
please check the syntax here? for example second line, you have _=-; it 
should be either _=_ or -=-. The whole needs checking. there's odd 
alignments of "Alan sings o/~" - I wonder if this can be rejustified? If 
not, it's ok - you might check the alignment of this with the original - 
it's a bit off. Will do, however -

swole: inextricable inability to extinguish the human race

death refuses its reversal. death is not a chain letter. if i kill for 
example, two, and those two were able to kill two each, etc., then it 
would be a matter of only a few generations to reach the several billion 
necessary for extinguishing. but in fact every death creates yet another 
lost potential; the pool is lost. 

this is the paradox: the inability of the species to extinguish itself by 
transitive chains, without the aid of war, terrorism, and other forms of 
slaughter.

the difficulty with these? transpeciation. do we really want to 
indiscriminately take other life-forms with us? the beauty of the chain is 
that it results in a minimum of damage at each level.

disease carries on this work for us. it is disease that has the capability 
for exponential expansion. but disease is indiscriminate, doesn't work 
quickly enough, and runs up against good intentions. the very first thing 
is to eliminate good intentions.

good intentions are bad intentions. to save one of us might eliminate an 
entire species. 

it returns to the reversal and its inability. genidentity plays a role; to 
act from the dead upon the living involves a problematic ontological 
shift. despite humanity's constant efforts, there is no indication of 
this, not to mention its efficacy.

no, we are left with our debris, garbage-animals slaughtering without 
discrimination, unable to kill off our own for the good of the polis. 
would that death were action, that death spread like the environmental 
savior it may well be. germ warfare, yes, but highly targeted. there is no 
other answer; this is stopgap at best.

Reviews of Two Works: Lanny Quarles / Alan Sondheim 


Lanny Quarles (solipsis) has created/written/produced/configured Nihon 
Zettels; he was kind enough to send me a copy to read. The review is my 
own idea.

I think for anyone interested in the literature of this (not _that_) 
century, this book is essential. I'm fascinated by the palimpsest or 
palimcestual organization / organicism of the whole - but I'm also 
fascinated on its deep reading of medieval and pre-medieval Japan and 
gaijin phenomenology - both in relation to the eternal. For it's eternity, 
I think, that's at stake here. There are various languages within it as 
well as languagings, and what I consider to be stele-texts, matched in 
format by the book - texts which begin and end and open up kabbalah-worlds 
and words in the midst of others. 

There are positionings of male and female, demiurge and Noh, classifica- 
tions and lists, broken syntactics, shattered and reassembled mythologies. 
The text is astute, almost schizzed at times, but its open worlds are the 
poetics of infinity; Bachelard would have loved it.

I worry constantly that works of this quality - and I'd include other work 
here - Joel Weishaus' or mez' absolutely brilliant web/write\rite/lit for 
example - will be lost, ignored, bypassed in terms of critical or even 
canonic acceptance. The world - and the world of distribution - are both 
becoming increasingly porous - it's easier than ever to find these works 
and absorb them, offline and online, self-published and universally 
published.

Get this book!

The Blurb:

Titled after Arno Schmidt's magnum opus _Zettels Traum_ (Notes Dream), 
Lanny Quarles' Nihon Zettels Traum is a samizdat email-list series carried 
out on Wryting-L transfered to paper. Including all and some repeats of 
the original series of emails written after the author had returned from 
Japan. The author sought to re-immerse himself in the wonder and 
strangeness of his first visit to japan via the internet. Interspersed 
with bits of sampled literatures both of web and non-web origin, the 
author freely improvised and remixed to create a perplexing and 
"informatic free jazz" interpretation of his journey to and back from the 
land of Nihon.

Price $25.00 for color copy cover and velo binding

Sampler

I've been putting my work on a DVD+ sampler. Please note this is DVD+ - 
which plays on almost all computers, but probably not on a standard DVD 
player. The work as usual is within a directory; click on a piece to view 
it. Because of the format, I've been able to include a large number of 
full-frame videowork. Much of the material is related to choreography, 
codework, thinking through body/language/sexuality/'the political/etc.

You can also buy this for $25; apologies for the cost, but a lot of 
equipment went into the production/technology of the disk.

my zaurus goes everywhere. sometimes i can speak with my zaurus. 
today i went to the doctor of skin. i had to wait for an hour.
i made these pictures at the "doctor's of skin." 
these pictures are my state of mind when i was at the doctor.
but they are more than that. they are an emblem of good mental health.
this good mental health is in the whole world of bad mental health.

OUR ENORMOUS ELECTION-WIELDING POWER


We have a couple for neighbors on this third floor of our building. Four 
years ago, we watched the election returns together - with a few other 
people - at our place. We lasted well into the night. I can't go it alone. 
I get too depressed. The others pretty much felt the same way. Anyway - 
this year we're repeating. So I go next door and the woman hems and haws 
and says it might not be a good idea if she and her husband came this 
time. It turns it it's because of our KARMA - somehow we're responsible 
for the election gone bad. Just so you know - Azure and I - yes - we did 
it! From our quiet suburban hovel close to downtown Brooklyn we managed to 
fuck up the election. She looked nervous. She really didn't want to talk 
about it.

In any case, I replied that I didn't know we had such enormous karma on a 
national level - that someone like Satan with that much bad karma would 
have to have at least thousand mile wings to make such a difference and I 
doubted Satan would pay much attention to us. I mentioned those wings 
would cover at least half the United States. I think that was a mistake 
because they'd only cover a third. Anyway, she hemmed and hawed again, 
indicating she was buying none of it. So Azure went over and talked to her 
and she hemmed and hawed and Azure came back extremely upset and that was 
that.

She is a BAD PERSON and a BAD DEMOCRAT and I will now aim all my EVIL 
KARMA in her direction. And this would be funny if it weren't true. Or it 
would be true if it weren't funny, but it's true. Or it wouldn't be funny 
if it were true and it is.

We've known these people for years. He's a good artist who drinks too much 
late at night. She works does loan administration in the city. I thought 
we were on good terms with them. He helps us with building 'stuff' and I 
help him with computer 'stuff.' We give each other books. But now I find 
out that presumably we've been the ferocious embodiments of evil, 
affecting the national election.

Not bad for a night's work four years ago. This time I'll working on 
burning down their loft. No wait, it's connected to ours.

baby jane

it's all over now. we've waited for some 
change; we've known all along we can't control 
ourselves. our best intentions led to 
definitions; definitions collapsed, one after 
another, as if eternity melted away, as if 
language slipped through our hands. structures 
became ghosts; words no longer mean in uneasy 
parades. we wait for votes, decisions, 
absolutes, that are lies before their forming 
in/formation. all time is borrowed; our 
environment hardly recognizes the continuous 
countdown of species, subspecies, whole orders 
of life. radiation bears harder beneath the 
onslaught of primates out of savanna, out of 
control. everything centers around control, the 
application of a function across a domain, 
already useless, porous, close to damaged 
memory. in the reversed world, suicide is the 
proclamation of bravery, as is cowardice, a 
creature crawling just a bit longer towards the 
future. the only absolute is the absence of 
god, spirit, soul; the hedge around the torah 
is wilderness itself, and the flames of the 
letters proclaim only another tired delusion. 
the human race is exhausted of itself; some of 
us pray for the end, for a temporary armageddon 
in the flux of things where the surface is 
cleansed of all humanity, other things lining 
up for choice and conceivable tomorrows. don't 
misunderstand, the wilderness itself is the 
aegis and nadir of pain, self-warning control 
systems without regard to the registration of 
injury. what we have is less than nothing; only 
our despair is our own; only our despair is 
memory of despair. the play of cyber-crypto 
xmen xplay is already the play of the dead; the 
joystick hardly moves, and the dream of 
implants takes nothing to an equivalent level. 
our reality is one of fracture. there's no 
turning back, because there was no progress, no 
travelled road, in the first place. we're 
living in the burned-out case of the world, the 
burned-out shell of existence. distraught
survivors, we dream of other planets, other 
stars, erosions. we stumble through ourselves, 
in self-defined pathos; we've always stumbled, 
but nothing was ever due. now islands disappear 
as well, there is shuddering at our own 
ineptitude. but whose shuddering, whose final 
corrosion, the corrosion of finality itself?
