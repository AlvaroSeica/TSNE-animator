FALSE SCIENCE





WHAT I HAVE DISCOVERED AS THE RESULT OF A CONTINUOUS MATHEMATICAL

INVESTIGATION INTO THE INTERSTITIAL BEHAVIOR OF DIGITAL\ANALOG 

DOMAINS: THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE:



I say to you: That REALITY is the promulgation of the extrusion of 

FORM from RASTER, that RASTER exists as an integrable and DISCRETE

MANIFOLD always already in flux. That the appearance of OBJECTS is

the result of both SENTIENCE and LISSAJOUS structures - which is _not_

to say the appearance of Descartes' vortices or any other metaphysical

construction, rather the uneasy CURDLING of the REAL, which is neither

equivalent to or coextensive with REALITY.



Calculate! Enter nothing more than y = sin kx into any digital dis-

play machine; increase k until the domain of harmonic structures 

occurs (i.e. well above the fundamental); sooner or later, secondary

structures, equivalent to Lissajous figures, will appear. NAME THEM!

GIVE THEM NAMES! Such is the domain of sentience and LISSAJOUS! 



The DISTINCT DIFFERENCE between the DOMAIN OF SIN and the domain of

REALITY is that the latter is non-Cartesian or Euclidean - in fact, 

the relative MOLECULAR STRUCTURE of the world is not subservient to 

any symmetric substructing (excluding such limited domains as the 

immediate territories of crystalline formations). The STRUCTURE is

always IN FLUX; it is within this flux that apparent (temporal/spatial_

STABILIZATIONS occur. These are RESNONANT WITH THE REAL and while it

is BUT METAPHORIC to insist on the LISSAJOUS SUBSTRATE, nevertheless

such a substrate emphasizes both the impermanence of these STABILIZA-

TIONS as well as its HARMONIC CAPACITY OF EXISTENCE as a BYPRODUCT

of WAVEFORM\PARTICLE REPRESENTATIONS. 



DO NOT MISTAKE THIS FOR A FALSE SCIENCE OR ANYTHING BUT AN IDENTICAL

RESONANCE WITH THE TRUTH:



FORM IS RUPTURED EXTRUSION.

FORM IS THE PRODUCTION OF SENTIENCE.
