last night i went sleeping into the thin fogged dampness
of wet white cloth on you, these contours opening to other liquids
fluxing across the wet damp white body as if a towel 
or other ruffled cloth, there were moments of gauze, wet, you could see
your skin through them slightly, moments of bleak darkness
where your body inverted, i thought you looked perfect in cyberspace
you were always in the moment of replying.


vary:

(blank darkness
(opening your liquids
(inverted/unfolded
<where your holes were
<oh beauty i'm speechless
<talk to me
(gauze stretched to the limit
(torn gauze
