(On the Style Here)

How do we break our own habits of reading and writing? External structures
help; I have used (for example) punctuation sequences (.,;:'"` etc.) in
texts as a way of moving them _elsewhere._ Reiterations, parallel frame-
works, foreign intrusions, all play a part.

Internal structures move from the surface ("Jennifer") into psychoanalyti-
cal interiors, churn towards subtexts, substructures, noise, chora, break-
downs of identities, flesh and ligaments of avatars. Dwelling in the flesh
of another, dwelling in the flesh of the same.

Internal structures move towards the surface ("Jennifer") becoming-other,
dragging the flesh and proper name, speaking in other tongues, through the
tongue of the other. Surface, they spread, emit, reside, stain, corrupt.
Channels are flood-plains, bidirectional.

Flood-plains unify interior and exterior, percolated, fissured. Cranial
substance moves towards pure-liquidity, melting of iceberg, external 
structures and their dissolutions. Psychosis rewrytes bodies them/selves.
Psychosis dams, coagulates, spews.

Informations flow through part-objects, structures, Jennifer-Alan's holes,
modular, encoded, encrypted, dissolved. Informations like tissue bring new
life towards quartic structures, these paragraphics, like Altair, first 
home computer, no monitor, switches.

Blinked switches turn text ./././././ fractal; Jennifers turn informations
towards contents, shape-riding throughout, Net /working within. At edges
of the cyber-galactic, amanuensis, claws, serrated edges, forms of these
investigations, centrifugal contents, slewed.
