way way


No, don't you do that. Don't you do that. Don't you slap my hand.
No, don't you walk that way. Don't you street the street. And don't
You corner the corner. If you corner the corner, you whichaway.
And don't you whichaway.

If you slap my hand, then you mouth my palm. Then you fill my mouth
And you speak to me. And you say this, Thus. And you say, Thus this.
If you speak to me. If I hear you speak. Don't you whichaway.

Don't you throw that rock. Don't you dare that rock. That rock goes
Whichaway. That rock goes down the road. Don't you touch that rock.
If you touch that rock you will hear from me. You will hear from me
If you touch that rock.

If there's a million years. If there's a billion years. That the rock
Will hug. That the rock joins the rock. That it is itself. Don't you 
Tell it that. Don't you speak to it.

That it's in your hand. That you slap my hand. That my hand signs you.
That you read the signs. That you turn the corner. That the corner
