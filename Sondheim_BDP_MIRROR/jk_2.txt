rm *.*

Envision a mime attachment composed of invisible escape codes; open it and
your account disappears (this should be possible). Think of a Perl memo
program with an unaliased rm *.* in it. Consider the consequences of such
codes embedded in this file (none). Contemplate the html code listed in
the current issue of Byte which hangs up Netscape as it searches for in-
coming from a com port. Work with a cookie that disappears into a hidden
file elsewhere in your directory, calling itself, if suitable, config.sys. 
Construct a deltree * cookie added to the netscape-spawning site that ov-
ertakes your ppp connection. Surprise me with a simple embedded program
adding echo to your input. Change my stty to row 10 column 10. Make me
yours with a new .sig Alan belongs to Jennifer. DCC me computerized pic-
tures of myself in consensual sex with animals and the Pope. Break down my
resistance with password violation; there's an "r" in it. Kill me softly
with your song, until I can't sing anything else. Make me _it._
