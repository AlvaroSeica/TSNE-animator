Cyberspace is often described as a space of flame wars and electronic

rape, a situation of potential violence, extremely hetero- and phallo-

centric. Call this the limit. (Call this the dead-end, the wrong

turn, the violation.)



The limit is the violence of desire, the effacement of the other, male

or female. Within the limit, there is procurement; there is a stream

of projections and introjections. Nothing remains on the surface of 

the text, appearances to the contrary.



When I transmit a post, I imagine it entering the darkness outside my

window, disappearing into the distance beyond the streetlamps. It ends

up in PURE SPACE, a readership on couch or deskchair or bed, a reader

in suspense, as if her breath were held for the duration. When I 

receive a post, the disquiet begins; I imagine languour, the post

entering the world of uneasy dreams, the noise of the disappointment 

of my body, a sense of _peering_ through my glasses into a world

disinterested and not of my design. I am afraid at this point of the

warmth and intimacy of the email, which fail all too often in real

life. But I cannot hold myself back; in a state of absolute loneliness

(the body devoured by the vacuum, at the edge of the abyss which it

alone has generated) I hear _her voice_, the maternal suturing the

letter back into the fold of skin from which, I imagine, it emerged.



The posts are labial, enfolding; they are any gender, any anatomy.



What I imagine is the _grain,_ the bone-and-flesh sound of the man or

woman who _speaks to me._



But he or she is speaking to the other of the REWRITE, [10] the lurker

adjacent to/beside me: _I overhear myself._ And I am _speaking with a

stranger,_ the most beautiful spy, most beautiful spy who _comes in 

from the cold_. And against my interests, against the _presence_ of 

my interests and my desires, I LURK WITHIN ME.
