[ JENNIFER


This html page is designed to run on Netscape 2.02 and above, as well as
MSE. It was tested on Netscape3.0 and Gold on Macintosh.

The page is the construct of function-Jennifer, performative-Jennifer. It
is a case or site of _wryting._ The page breathes and stutters, not always
in correlation with the text.

Additional comments for various browsers, and view-source-code are inter-
spersed throughout.

Download and run in any directory. This program doesn't work with lynx and
other text-based browsers.
