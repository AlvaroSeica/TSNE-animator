I make video art, sometimes with residency at the Experimental Art Center in
NYC and I used the line "I love you, Amy Fisher" for several pieces, working
with a sampler, and combining with fairly intense imagery (not of her, of
other things, parts of bodies, etc.) and the strange thing is that I felt I
was in love with her although that's absurd, and it lasted only when I was
working on the piece - and I think to be in love with her in reality would
actually be to want to control her, feeling you could save her, which isn't
the case actually, but something you would feel and it's a way of not
_seeing_ her really, who she is. So I was very careful in this way to
realize my feelings were coming out of a disturbing sense of erotics and
nothing else, but the tapes were beautiful.
