The Last Word


<Tiffany:> Thinking is exhaustion.

<Jennifer:> Thinking is the murder of the real.

<Honey:> Words fill my mouth with sand; words scream from me.

<Jennifer:> They echo from the dry rocks. They scream back at me.

<Tiffany:> The sun makes no difference. The sun makes difference
           from the moon.

<Honey:> They divide, they begin the process of the sign.

<Tiffany:> They end the process, sleep during the night when dreams
           refuse their meaning.

<Jennifer:> Meaning belongs to thought, to words. Meaning is an
            interference.

<Honey:> Meaning is a diffraction among words and things. It ripples.

(They are silent.)

<Honey:> Meaning ripples, exhausting the world. Meaning is for 
         survival. Nothing means.

<Tiffany:> Nothing means but when thinking exhausts, meaning appears. 
           It appears to save us.

<Jennifer-The-Last-Word:> The far side of the moon, but the corona
                          of the sun.
