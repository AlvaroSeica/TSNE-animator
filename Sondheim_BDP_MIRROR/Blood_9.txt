Water


Just as the water-sprite, formed from the motion of atoms in the midst of
others of her kind, senses the world at large, fluxing through her chosen
medium of transparency - so do we, in our bid to comprehend the universe,
look inside of ourselves, formed from the same atoms, quarks, transparenc-
ies. What floods us floods the stars; neutrons rush through, cosmic rays
occasionally spray bright spots against the retina in the dominion of the
dark-adjusted eye. We inhale the vacuum, thrust forward by the presence of
air; our words perform the actions of sounds at the depths of the sun. 

Just so, the contemplative life, which permits us to filter all sensation,
leaving us with the debris of the abyss alone - here we meditate upon the
virtues of interior and exterior opened to the whirlwind. The water-sprite
understands her world and ours, of the same; she changes oh so brilliantly
into manifold shapes and specters. Thus do we move, motivated beyond our-
selves, through a thousand thoughts, a thousand thousand words taking us
into the realm of beautiful, true understanding. 

We are all the same-atomic, our quantum fields interact in a fashion close
to specular - each providing a mirror of the same to the same, the stage
in which we begin to coalesce our ridden form. Thus the dawn forever turn-
ing towards us, revealing new shapes in each and every horizon, and thus
the water-sprite has taught us, on her way somewhen and where, beyond our
loving comprehension.
