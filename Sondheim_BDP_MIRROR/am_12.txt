If, by Rudyard Kipling


If I could I always would go to the tree where my parents stood There in
the night with candle light I'd cry Babylon for my daughter's plight Down
where my son has almost gone, I'd find the one with the golden palm Back
where the flame has blackened my name I'd play the game of silver fame
With weeping and wails in rains and hails I'd set my ship with copper
sails And travel the Net where I would would get my family and yet the
storm would set Upon the stores with fire and hail the whores of Babylon
scream their wars And I'd go no farther for sister or brother or bother a
mother or kill the father Beneath the world where famished for food in
angry mood the couple lewd Did pace this space to make a face my own with
grace that died apace O die decease in peace the lease of land is found
with crease Where Tigris flows Euphrates goes the couple lewd on raft
sights crows And other birds or troubled herds that make these words
fulfill with woes What I could say if I could splay my legs to play in
eagle's way Where fire sires liars, pyres expire, wires tire, cryers mire
And if I could I would be mood wood.
