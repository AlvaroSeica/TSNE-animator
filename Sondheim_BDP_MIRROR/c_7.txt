the last whisper





a young beautiful boy moves to an island. a young beautiful boy moves to

an island. he sees a computer on the island. he sees a computer on the

island. the computer says, i don't have long to live. the computer says, i

don't have long to live. the boy listens to the computer. the boy listens

to the computer. he quietly removes his clothing. he quietly removes his

clothing. he will always caress the keyboard. he will always caress the

keyboard. he remembers the dying light of the screen. he remembers the

dying light of the screen. he remembers the last whisper of the warning

tone. he remembers the last whisper of the warning tone. he remembers for

the first time watching life drain out. he remembers for the first time

watching life drain out. he holds onto the carapace, rocking gently back

and forth. he holds onto the carapace, rocking gently back and forth. he

rocks back and forth with his death in his hands. he rocks back and forth

with his death in his hands. he rocks back and forth. he rocks back and

forth. he rocks back and forth. he rocks back and forth.
