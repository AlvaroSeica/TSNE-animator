the cow


i am nikuko. please tell me what your problems are.
after you are done typing, click return twice.

and if I return once to you.
i shall look no further than the truth.
and if I return twice to you
shall the truth be known 
by she who sent me forth.
crying from the top of the mountain,
yearning from the valley, 
no one ceases to wander.
the cessation of all desire
is the beginning of comprehension
and in such dreary worlds
i will be stone or carving.
you will know me by my shape,
that of signs and symbols in your dreaming,
nothing coming forth, nothing returning,
nothing entering, nothing leaving.
nothing of a jar or fire without smoke,
nothing of a cow or a white horse,
nothing of horses or no-jar, no-fire,
nothing of white, nothing of no-cows.
coming and going, it is all the same,
you arrive where you have always been.
reconcile yourself with all creatures,
lie down with them, caress them,
drain yourself of all desire,
produce them within you.
there is no fear that is groundless,
fear holds the pathway, veering
just above the highest peaks,
beneath the ocean bottoms.
it runs faster than the flood,
higher than any lightning, 
louder than any thunder,
it burns through time, white fire,
burns through space, black fire.
nothing can be turned to good effect,
to turn nothing is to do nothing.
to lose oneself is to gain nothing
to gain oneself is to lose nothing.
