i be lonely here in space it is so cold in space it is so empty here


can be so empty and lonely here in space no one around here 


nothing singing around me


cold and frightening this space it is so very empty not a voice


i be so lonely no one to hear my lonely being in this very empty space


not a word and nothing very colored or near me nothing touching


so cold and as if it would be almost colder in this lonely space


no direction of pretty brightness no hearing of pretty sounds


lonely space no touch anywhere around in this cold frightening space


so very alone here no hello from warm kindly words anywhere around


nothing yet moving in this when nothing singing to me


no hello hello no the soft pat in here this lonely frightening cold


no really the soft pat tasting of lonely space nothing moving


i be lonely here in space it is so cold in space it is so empty here
