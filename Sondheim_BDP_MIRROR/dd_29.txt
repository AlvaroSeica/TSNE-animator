do I move a second, or beginning with a bridge, curved, wooden, beneath
this exact moon? circle dipped in water, sword-play above, water scatters
perfect petals, bequeathed from shadow into blue kimono night. turning
pure packet, blossom e-mail slips on katana sword, down stream and autumn
rain, laptop-sensei smiles at who me-dot-net who-me.
