phenomenology, ring, the divided finger, for penny

ring, the inscribed finger
ring, the finger fissured
golden ring dividing me from myself
signifier, difference, body not my own
_the meaning_
_line_ from any side around the cylinder of flesh
cut or incision of the ring, circulations around through valuable metal
stony culmination at ring's _front,_ secrecy of the back, folded against
 the moistened palm
cold and valuable dross of dysfunctional metal
gleam traveling circulations of the heart, breasts, mind
traveling the inert circumference, so absent! from any movement
_turning the ring_ garnered by mobile stone's position, loving finger
chain-link, your owning me, o gleaming, moist, and fetishistic
marker, or winnowing of the mines
_lunar_ ring, scratched nighttime face, elemental, elements on the move
tethered-to-you ring, ectoplasms, nuances, _the uncanny_
nighttime wakening, fingers in me, golden metal nuzzling teeth
your ring, my ring, golden-mouth ring, you harboring
ringing me, voice of golden metal, token / taken
taken, fingers among us, ring, ringing, fingers among us,
swallowed tip of finger, golden ring in teeth
'i am married to your ring'
