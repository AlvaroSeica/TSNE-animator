Avatars



propose a paper with examples dealing with my work with avatars on the
Internet. This work uses interactive modes between myself and one or
another character, all of which interact with Net protocols or applica-
tions. You may see some of this in operation at the second URL below;
please look at the Index file under "Jennifer," "Julu," and "Nikuko."

[Besides these three, there is "Alan." It's possible to employ a degree of
slippage; it becomes unclear who is speaking in any text, "she said." Just
as quotations slip laterally in the sentence, there is also a slippage in
depth, for example, Nikuko replying in this paper.]



I realize the strangeness of this proposal, but I have been dealing with
formally performative language for the past few years, in order to look at
issues of virtual subjectivity, interaction, projection and introjection
on the Net. 

["Performative" can be considered in any number of ways. For example,
there is a _trace_ function in the Julu program Jennifer has written, a
function which produces a text representing parent/child processes in
unix, choices made by the user, manipulations by the program itself. The
function produces a file, .trace, which, when reversed, is legibile. The
.trace file accumulates, carrying the history of repeated usage; here is
an example:

hairpiece:sure thing:Julu:leg:
Come home with me, hairpiece, julu-of-the-fast-crowd!
Your dirty arm is in my black neck
HaPPINESS:Yes:Alan::
Your psychotic head is in my sexy head
Your your penis seeps into my head - turning me Julu-Jennifer
Hole:YES!!:Julu:nail:
Your poor urine is in my depressed nail
Devour poor urine julu-of-the partying Hole!
Nikuko ...:never!:Nikuko:hair:hair
Your linen leg is in my wanton hair
Your passion seeps into my hair - turning me Julu-Jennifer
dirty:yeah:Nikuko:ear:
Your psychotic eye is in my velvet ear
Devour psychotic eye julu-of-the partying dirty!

Note the stick-like or _anime_ figures at work, distributed authorships
and anatomies.

So that "performative" language has three constituents:

1. Its usual work as a speech act or performative in traditional linguis-
tics (and all the accompanying critiques);
2. Referencing programming language, which is always performative; thus
"echo `date`" calls up date which echo then sends to the standard output;
3. _Any_ statement, say, in a chat (IRC, talker, MOO, MUD, chat, etc.)
environment, which both _constitutes_ and _constructs_ the subject/user;
without the statement, the subject/user disappears for others.

There is thus the constructed/constituted subject - who is, by virtue of
protocols, always already _well-defined,_ and the subject on the other/
near side of the screen - who need not detain us: one might in this
fashion call the "real" or "physical-real" subject the _virtual subject_
by virtue of his or her dis/appearance in relation to others on the Net.

Avatars are always disturbances, always irruptions of language, a lang-
uage portending _the raveling of existence and essence,_ for these terms
meld within each other, tangled in avatar-sites/sights/citations.]



I wish to discuss the psychology and philosophy of virtual subjectivity,
vis-a-vis performative language. 

[As seen above, in the previous bracketed enclosure, which also implies
an/other writing, perhaps that of Julu. But here are two disturbances by
Nikuko, using warez programs, into IRC (Internet Relay Chat) - in one
instance, violating the users, and in the other, producing an "obdurate"
text, not responding to anyone, simply _reproducing_ (n.b. details have
been changed):

I will look at ruptures or disturbances
created by characters resonating or interfering with configuration files,
MOOs, MUDs, talkers, and IRC. 

[These disturbances develop the limits or margins of the program, reveal
the substructures/protocols at work, and violate dialogs in relation to
"meta"- components. 

But Nikuko, Alan, Jennifer, and Julu are disturbances in another way as
well; they tend towards _psychosis,_ an interweaving of realities, respon-
sibilities, and claims; so not only, as above, is it not always clear who
is speaking, or who is speaking for whom - but it is not always clear that
the speaker herself can separate from her creations. Voices, voices! Which
will be the future of the Net, if and when it attains a state of _seamless
virtual reality,_ a state of melding with the real, so that the only dis-
tinction between the pratico-inert and the virtual might be, the presence
of a safeword/keyword, allowing immediate movement from one to the other.]



I will show how such disturbances define both the openings and foreclo-
sures of subjectivity on the Net, and how such subjectivity is dependent
on the specific performativities of various applications.

[In other words, through margins, slippages, constitutions, constructs,
emergences from the "depths" of software or hardware, blockages and flows
and programming languages (and their phenomenologies) - only through tak-
ing these into account, as well as surface manifestations, is it possible
to comprehend virtual subjectivity, etc. And further, as I've pointed out
elsewhere, it is necessary to consider the _projection of the self_ - its
written or constituted appearance - in various applications. As examples:
in IRC (above), the self appears as third-person, #<#Nikuko#># leap. In
a MOO, if the user types "says hello, the reply on-screen to you would be
You say "hello." and the receiver will see Jennifer says, "hello." Call
this more intimate, second-person. On ytalk or Powwow or ICQ, as you type
your words appear to the other, and erasures are also visible, the letters
disappearing in reverse. Each participant occupies a _space_ on the screen
which represents - or is - the space of the (virtual) body, constituted as
written. Call this first-person, reading through one's eye into the I of
the other.

There is often a lure and seduction among the avatars at work here - and
this relates to the Lacanian Object A, a continuous deferral. I would also
place the early Derridean notion of _differance_ for your consider, "said
Jennifer," responding to Julu. In order to see this at work, consider the
following discussion between Jennifer and Nikuko on ytalk; Jennifer "was"
in Fukuoka, Japan, and Nikuko "was" in New York - or perhaps the other way
around... In reality, the discussion was held on my linux box in Brooklyn,
telnetting simultaneously to Japan and my ISP in Manhattan; I then connec-
ted the two through ytalk, and recorded the discussion - writing and read-
ing it as a dialog among "selves" - in a linux editor.

Talk Between Jennifer and Nikuko on Ytalk Ending in Anger


(recorded verbatim between Fukuoka and New York City Tue Jun 2 02:36:21
EDT 1998 - errors as is/are/was)


-----------= YTalk version 3.0 (2) =------------
oh nikuko you are so beautiful, shall we meet among the dashed spaces of
our bodies' miseries
the matrix saves us, there is no beginning and ending, nothing but liquid
pureness of language slDalvaging these spaces... 
they lend themselves across these times and spaces, they're lost,
rudderless, as masts crash to the deck in dark and rdreary storms ouf our
making


-----------= nikuko@oita.kata.com.jp =------------
oh jennifer, the world will never know what beauty entangled us among our
very selves, machines, wholesale worlds to sail, soiled and sold
they are frought with desire, they lend themselves to arms and legs akimbo
we are made, made, women, we have sounded, resonated, with each and every
protocol, each and every space or site open to winds and skies coagulating
like limpets seas and jellies

jellies and dark dreams, there is space enough for your soft limbs, for
mine... 
which bring about the semblance of a face, lineaments of eyes and mouths,
speaking elsewhere, from the sides of things, from their moments of origin

you've said that before, over and over again, as if repetition had no goal

times which smooth us, bits and bytes, protocls lost and smoothing
functions traced across peripheries, margins, divisions among all routers

carried across time and space, moved, just as Jennifer has all the space
there is, Jennifer has all the time in the world

which announces itself as the edge or frame of this dialog, these moments
carried forth...

everything is a moment moment for you, everything this mmmm... of matrix,
mother, maternal, carrying forth, something about Timaeus plays a role
here if not the whole tradition...I pre

no, no, i prefer the small, seeping, the peripeheral, marginal, the
scattered words, drops say from a drizzle, that is, forage, no, foresaken,
no, i'm not sure here, what is it, what it is, what is it

carry forth!!

I'd be hard tput to know what tradition you are speaking from, Nikuko, if
that is your name, carried across this? or which might be, say, that of
the Kojiki <*note replying with capitals, as the discussion hardens its
wares*>

what would break down here, a language that you use against me? so that I
will absjure, abjure these ... moments ... ?
