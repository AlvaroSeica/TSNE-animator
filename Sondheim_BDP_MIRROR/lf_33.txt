"When Last We Dashed Across the Fields, To Celebrate Our Savior's Birth"


When last We Dashed across the fields, pulled by One Horse and Hir Sleigh
wHEN LAST wE dASHED ACROSS THE FIELDS, PULLED BY oNE hORSE AND hIR sLEIGH
Urging the Horse on, Screaming against the Wind, all of us Buried in SNow
uRGING THE hORSE ON, sCREAMING AGAINST THE wIND, ALL OF US bURIED IN snOW
And not paying Attention to Whatever the HOT STEED stumbled across 
aND NOT PAYING aTTENTION TO wHATEVER THE hot steed STUMBLED ACROSS 
The SCREAMING OF SLEIGHBELLS, the ragged WHINNY and FROZEN BREATH 
tHE screaming of sleighbells, THE RAGGED whinny AND frozen breath 
To this Day, I cannot imagine Hir LUNGS, the Sleigh half overturned 
tO THIS dAY, i CANNOT IMAGINE hIR lungs, THE sLEIGH HALF OVERTURNED 
In the Rotted fields, the Horse, as if Pursued by Violent Strangers 
iN THE rOTTED FIELDS, THE hORSE, AS IF pURSUED BY vIOLENT sTRANGERS 
The Sleigh filled with drunks in Celebration of the Birthday of God 
tHE sLEIGH FILLED WITH DRUNKS IN cELEBRATION OF THE bIRTHDAY OF gOD 
-- To this Day, I scream now, Fuck God! The horse died because of Hirm 
-- tO THIS dAY, i SCREAM NOW, fUCK gOD! tHE HORSE DIED BECAUSE OF hIM! 
Falling in the Fields through which He was hard compelled to dash: 
fALLING IN THE fIELDS THROUGH WHICH hE WAS HARD COMPELLED TO DASH:

tHAT SUDDENLY THE BREATH hALTS, THE HORSE CRASHES INTO THE SNOW, LEGS
BROKEN, eyes TURNED BACK vIOLENTLY IN THE head, THAT goD CRASHES hIMSELF
DOWN AGAINST THE sWOLLEN BELLY, THAT THE rUNNERS HAVE CUT THROUGH THE
mERRY-mAKERS tORTURED bodies, SKEWED LIMBS lOST IN THE general mayhem.
