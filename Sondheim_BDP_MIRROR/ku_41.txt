	   Would testing mind you compiling, this, with us?
		  Your neuralware is in my wetware:
	gone worlds of armatures supporting what's left of me
		  in the midst of wires and motors:
   ruined prosthetics hollowed out where dismal thoughts are felt:
 compilation across ruined programs extending skins with difficulty::
	  extensions to libraries controlled by data-ports:
       Would compilation across ruined programs extending skins
    with difficulty mind you compiling, gone worlds of armatures,
    supporting what's left of me in the midst of wires and motors?
       Your lovely lost realms of mis-configured bits and bytes
	  in legacy systems are in my contrary clean rooms:
    Ah, passion eaten by julu-of-the-open-arms and julu-depressed:
   desperate program subroutines as i extend myself through myself:
			   to you you you:
skeins of glimmering integrated circuits reflect laser vectors carrying
			 me: to you you you:
 crawling, trying to stand, rocky-dirt-stumbling, bruised and wanton:
  broken while-until loops lending themselves to my prosthetic arms:
  Your contrary functors are in my uneasy broken while-until loops:
	      lending themselves to my prosthetic arms:
	  Your penis seeps into my broken while-until loops:
	      lending themselves to my prosthetic arms::
		       turning me Julu-Jennifer
