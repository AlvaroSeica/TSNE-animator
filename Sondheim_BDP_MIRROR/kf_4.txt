Passing the Ball Along, I mean Semiotics and Differance


"A Man of Words

"A man of words and not of deeds,
Is like a garden full of weeds;
And when the weeds begin to grow,
It's like a garden full of snow;
And when the snow begins to fall,
It's like a bird upon the wall;
And when the bird away does fly,
It's like an eagle in the sky;
And when the sky begins to roar,
It's like a lion at the door;
And when the door begins to crack,
It's like a stick across your back;
And when your back begins to smart,
It's like a penknife in your heart;
And when your heart begins bleed,
You're dead, and dead, and dead indeed."

(Anonymous poem from The Penguin Book of Comic and Curious Verse,
selected by J. M. Cohen, 1952.)

They were _passing the ball along_ from one to another, the happy
runners running across the field with smiles on their face. They
called the movement _the lateral_ or possibly _the deference of the
image_ because it was precisely that, among these schoolboys passing
from one another, passing for one another. But what was being passed
but the imaginary, and in what realm was the oval playing-field? I
think this might have been the realm of dreams or the realm of these
space wherein we type forward to one another, waiting, languorously,
for the perfect return.

I remember happy voices passing back and forth among us. I remember
talking going well into the night, from later afternoon until darkness
befalls the world. I remember these beautiful pictures and the manner
in which they live within us, small children always in awe, always in
awe.

And I remember, too, the sense of wonder with the beginning of the
first word, the first phrase, the first sentence. When it was always
dawn. When it was always spring.
