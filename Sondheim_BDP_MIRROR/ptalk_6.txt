Background as Performance

The same ground of horror repeats itself, day after day, night after night,
no longer events or news, so much as a background of horror. Then what? A
serious question: How can art, art performance, performance, heal, help
one make it through the day, inspire one, against this background of
continuous performance, where everything, lives, cultures, languages, are
at stake? We watch other species world-wide going extinct (the rate is
something like several an hour), we find ourselves on the verge of a
planet so violated that the environment (cultural, global) might well
collapse (yes, into something else) within the century, and we perform?
Three nights ago, we did just that, perform from our last two cds at a
place in Brooklyn, and we were brilliant for that moment, then the horrors
take over again. (Personally I don't think ego plays a role in this, and
personally as well, Buddhism has failed me, or vice versa.) I won't post
more headlines like these again, and apologies for doing so; this is the
raw world, perhaps at its worst.

There are two backgrounds: This, above, and the Internet of Things  they
come together in hacking and cyberwar See http://map.ipviking.com/ .
