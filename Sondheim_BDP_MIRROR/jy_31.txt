This is for you.
This is working its way to you, this is coming to you, in spite of
everyone.
This is for you, and you alone. This is private; you'll understand and no
one else will.
I've given up my face. I have no face any more. 
I have wood, stone, and cotton. I sparkle. I am fierce, beneath
cotton, stone, and wood.
This is the gift I can give you.
This is for you.
