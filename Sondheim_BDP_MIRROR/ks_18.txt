"This is offline writing, oddly cast against nothing in the world and
with no time at all." My life is "offline" now, with the preservation
of email elsewhere. There were moments _between_ leaving the I'll be
away message on the answering machine, _and_ entering the car service
for the airport, _when_ I was invisible. My friends did not recognize
my invisibility. It was invisible. There were other moments of suspense
high above the earth. I am at home on planes because they are nowhere.
From the plane I could lean the fm radio against the window _and_ pick
up perfect station. What would otherwise have gone into space, what I
brought back, alternative rock against some black smudges that must
have been the Sierras. I drew the radio _up_ like ectoplasm engulfing
the remains of a body performing. So true, so other, _signed._
