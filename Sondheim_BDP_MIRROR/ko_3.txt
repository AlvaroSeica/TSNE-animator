The Case of the Real (Declarative, for Lexie)


"What appears to be a book about words is. So it's. Where there is. What
appears to be awash in philosophy is. This is. It's. How is. It is. Al-
ready, for such a text is. But it is. Perhaps it is. Or rather, the ling-
uistic is. Nor are. There is. Death is. Death is. There is. Technology is.
Technology is. The machine is. It is. Technology is. But this is. This is.
Technology is. The surfaces are. This is. Cataclysm, dissolution, the col-
lapse of the molecular, atomic, are. Being is. Perhaps Being is. Being is.
It is. Intervals are. From moment to moment, speech is. At the heart of
the written, there is. Transformations, becomings, are. There is. Almost
all flows have been lost; this is. Our concern is. Words lead; they are.
Words are. There is. Today is. There is. Not to write is. The beginning of
the book is. What was. There are. Pure process is. One is. To step from
the beginning, to step from this beginning, is. But mathesis is. There is.
Everything and nothing are. Either everything is. Linkage is. One maps
palely against or through the other; technology is. Following Lyotard, one
might say that the real is. Writing is. It is. The scene is. The scene is.
The scene is. It is. It is. It is. It is. The world is. It is. It is. This
is. It is. On the other hand, there are."
