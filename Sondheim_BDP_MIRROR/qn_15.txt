On the map -

I'm thinking of virtual worlds as abstracted, split, chosen, programmed: 
anything that is programmable is possible. Think of the real world as 
given, born-into: thought as conceiving. Consider virtual worlds _not_ as 
subsets of real life - as fulcrums; consider virtual worlds as the visual 
counterpart of the space of Mathematica.

Again, the psychology, psychoanalytics of virtual worlds: borromean knot, 
matrix, meta-level jumping (collocation of constructing, dwelling-in). And 
in virtual worlds, the body as entangled projections/introjections (jecti- 
vity) independent of traditional physical constraint or representation The 
locus of the body in the physical body (second life as perceptual organ)

Finally, think of the traditional/narratological function of virtual 
worlds as equivalent to cinematic diegesis (editing, jump-cuts, multiple 
viewpoints, etc.) and the non-traditional functionings of virtual worlds 
(above) as processes of dynamic suturing.
