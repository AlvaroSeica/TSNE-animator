lulled bye

now i lay my head to rest                       to get out
i think upon the perfect breast                 to get out of this life
i have not seen nor found nor kept              get out of this life
what might have seemed unsound; i wept          get out
foundation, i wept disease,                     to please
recriminations; release me please               please
to get out of this life                         o please
without substance, head, or strife              to get out
which is why i lay a head to rest               to get out of this life
to drink the perfect liquid                     get out of this life
and from the perfect breast                     get out
                               urinary basin
