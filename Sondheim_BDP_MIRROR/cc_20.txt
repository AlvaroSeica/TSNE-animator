Rave-Time written at 300 Baud


i

300 baud:

is a form of meditation, forced to use primitive programs without screen
redraws, simplified commands --

as if each word were to present itself alone on the screen for
contemplation

or that a word would exist within a breath or the breath of a phrase
thus breathing the language

because the speed of the machine is now identical to the speed of reading
and writing upon the machine

because the machine is slowed in its veins and forms of platelet
communications, blood streams of packets slowed for sounding out

because the screen is breast, and cursor nipple, and my body presses tight
against its rhythm of ejaculation

as it speaks for and against, thus the one in return and the other

as it races along the anarchic sputtering of wires heated exactly in the
midst of the procession of the human: 

no wonder the boards freeze shut with organic secretions from the dreams of
a million hackers

no wonder I clasp the remaining syllables to my chest, erect teats
flooding the world with my murmuring

it is this speed, like the speed of the rave: that's it, exactly!

the machine has become rave-speed; reduced to its origins, it has become
one of us! 

its juices flow as impulses stutter to the depth of a womb, length of a
distended penis! 

300 baud: I read and write you _exactly_! 

for the first and last, this is my body breathing _for you_ and _in your
space._

nothing has fucked me like the machine!

nothing has loved me like it either!
