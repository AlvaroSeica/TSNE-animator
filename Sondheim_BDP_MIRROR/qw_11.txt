the texture-object: INVISIBILITY PRIM PUBLIC v1.1a by Beatfox Xevious:
"SL has a few special system textures that are only accessible by UUID key 
and that possess properties which no other textures do.  Namely, a prim 
using one of these textures is capable of rendering whatever avatar 
textures and textures containing alpha channels are inside or behind it 
completely invisible.  Normal textures that do not contain alpha channels 
will remain untouched."
