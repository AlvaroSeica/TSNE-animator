JEN-OF-JPEG

I haven't the maw for this, twisted in cyberspace, this tissue-mass torn
from semblance of electron orbitals; I can't gainsay the dark river or
chthonic illumination, gleamed / glowed. This is an _exact thing_ of
what-goes-down-the-wires, says Jennifer-the-last-word, neither a model nor
a duplicate, neither an analog nor an image-log; this is _it,_ _id,_ shut-
tled across the womb or loom, entrance skeined with fiber-optic receptors
(DO YOU HEAR ME, MISSY?), WYSIWYG _all the way down._ Jennifer-the-last-
word says _this is her,_ you're getting _her,_ not a clothing-horse nor a
photograph, neither bitmap nor pixel-structure. This is _it-the-her,_ and
_you've got her,_ bloomed white, glowed glam, cybernauts full-speed, a
head and torso, _twisted from the travel,_ _torn with the torment,_ says
Jennifer-the-last-word, BORN BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL, DO YOU READ ME, MISSY?
still _all the way down._
