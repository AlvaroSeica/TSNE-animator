blank ink in the waters, but what ink is not blank, Jennifer would go on
to say? even the reading and the writing of kanji, of text through the
ink, depends on its gift creating sign and letter almost as an after-
thought. for it is the shape of the ink, the contours of its boundaries
on the clarity of the page, that we interpret, not the blankness of the
ink itself, which remains barely submerged, a reminder of chaos, death,
and absence. ink grants the permission to mean, just barely; Jennifer
means, and Julu takes away.

black ink in the waters, dissipating slowly, Nikuko would reply, catch-
ing a glimpse of naked Julu out of her eye's corner, the creating of
narrative, schemata, the line of separation thrust in the dirt, separ-
ating and creating the two of them. glimpsing memory
