The Hunt

I was present at hunt's origin,
The swinging of the rope, the wild calls;
Time and again, I was a messenger,
But no one would believe me. Now, here,
Is the proof of the children in the wilderness.
And here, now, the birds crying over the dead.

I have been ceded the golden transmission,
And have made play to give this gift to you;
Receive it in good grace, and recompense
Of the dark world's suffering shall be
Your understanding in no other worlds to come.

Multi and Peregrine Falcon


the most important five minutes of your life

multi: this is a sequence of images that relate to the presentation of 
sellf in everyday virtual life; the images were used in ongoing lecture 
series; the analysis is practically implicit; i emphasized the distinction 
among first/ second/ third person texts; now this is an archaeology as 
well; so many of these applications have disappeared or been transformed; 
the principles remain the same, the necessity of continuous rewrite to 
indicate presence, ascii sexuality as control structures, defuge as 
exhaustion and decathecting of desire under certain circumstances, mixed 
spatialities and metaphors, concretions of the analog world within text - 
or still or moving image, or sound - http://www.asondheim.org/multi/
- the images constituting the nexus of theoretical apparatus, postcards 
from the dead, postmodern pickwick papers, online clubland of everyday 
life - take time with them - enlightenment -

Now also on the blog - pictures of an incredible peregrine falcon taken on 
Bergen Street between Fifth and Flabush, right around the corner from us. 
The street gathered around the 'event' which made the news (I was on TV! 
YAY!) on New York One. Tonight we went back and the bird is gone; we can 
only hope nothing has happened to it - we scoured the neighborhood but 
weren't oble to locale him or her.

I wrote them after I was born and before I died.
I wrote them before I was born and before I died.

High-Speed Sutra


I don't know what it means to practice Zen.
I don't know what it means to do anything at all.
Whatever it means, I'm not doing it. I'm definitely not doing it.

I think I might practice something.
I'm already at the edge of the cliff. Something, anything, one for all.
All for one is nothing. I won't practice that.
I won't practice writing either.

The practice of writing is writing.
The practice of Zen is nothing at all. I won't do it.
This isn't writing, this is practice.
I'll write something later on.

I should add I don't know anything about Zen.
I should add I'm writing borrowed-Zen.
I don't know anything about Zen, I'm writing borrowed-Zen.
My Zen is faster than yours.
I should add my Zen is fast.

I won't do it, not even to do it. I won't do Zen.
There are hungry ghosts after me, they know!
Where they are, I'm not. Where I am, they won't go!
My Zen is faster than theirs. My ducks are enlightened Kwak! Kwak!

Not dying is not not wanting to die.
Dying is not wanting to die and not not wanting to die. 
After a while negation buzzes. Automata make negation machines.
Negation machines buzz for me. They make things faster.

Just because my Zen is fast doesn't mean it's not Zen.
Just because I feel nothing doesn't mean I'm not enlightened.
My enlightened Zen takes a nanosecond.
Whatever takes anything, I'm not doing it!
I haven't done it either!

This is the High-Speed Sutra.


Masquerades, Curiosities


Johnson on Masquerade:

... "Behold, Flirtilla, at thy feet, a man grown gray in the study of 
those noble arts by which right and wrong may be confounded; by which 
reason may be blinded, when we have a mind to escape from her inspection; 
and caprice and appetite insated in uncontrolled command and boundless 
dominion? Such a casuist may surely engage, with certainty of success, in 
vindication of an entertainment, which in an instant, gives confidence to 
the timorous, and kindles ardour in the cold; an entertainment where the 
vigilance of jealousy has so often been eluded, and the virgin is set free 
from the necessity of languishing in silence; where all the outworks of 
chastity are at once demolished; where the heart is laid open without a 
blush; where bashfulness may survive virtue, and no wish is crushed under 
the frown of modesty." ...

And of Curiosities:

... "I have suffered nothing worthy the regard of a wise man to escape my 
notice: I have ransacked the old and the new world, and been equally 
attentive to past ages and the present. For the illustration of ancient 
history, I can show a marble, of which the inscription, though it is not 
now legible, appears from some broken remains of the letters, to have been 
Tuscan, and therefore probably engraved before the foundation of Rome. I 
have two pieces of porphyry found among the ruins of Ephesus, and three 
letters broken off by a learned traveller from the monuments of Persep- 
olis, a piece of stone which paved the Areopagus of Athens, and a plate 
without figures or characters, which was found at Corinth, and which I 
therefore believe to be that metal which was once valued before gold. I 
have sand gathered out of the Granicus; a fragment of Trajan's bridge over 
the Danube; some of the mortar which cemented the watercourse of Tarquin; 
a horse-shoe broken on the Flaminian way, and a turf with five daisies dug 
from the field of Pharsalia." ...

"The Persian monrachs are said to have boased the greatness of their 
empire by being served at their tables with drink from the Ganges and the 
Danube: I can show one vial, of which the water was formerly an icicle on 
the crags of Caucasus, and another that contains what once was snow on the 
top of Atlas; in a third is dew brushed from a banana in the gardens of 
Ispahan; and in other, brine that has rolled in the Pacific ocean. I 
flatter myself that I am writing to a man who will rejoice at the honour 
which my labours have procured to my country; and therefore I shall tell 
you that Britain can, by my care, boast of a snail that has crawled upon 
the wall of China; a humming-bird which an American pricess wore in her 
ear; the tooth of an elephant who carried the queen of Siam; the skin of 
an ape that was kept in the palace of the great mogul; a riband that 
adorned one of the maids of a Turkish Sultana; and a scymetar once wielded 
by a soldier of Abas the great." ...

"In collecting antiquities of every country, I have been careful to choose 
only by intrinsic worth, and real usefulness, without regard to party 
opinions. I have therefore a lock of Cromwell's hair in a box turned from 
a piece of the royal oak; and keep in the same drawers, sand scraped from 
the coffin of king Richard, and a commission signed by Henry the Seventh. 
I have equal veneration for the ruff of Elizabeth and the shoe of Mary of 
Scotland; and should lose, with like regret, a tobacco-pipe of Raleigh, 
and a stirrup of king James. I have paid the same price for a glove of 
Lewis, and a thimble of queen Mary; for a fur cap of the Czar, and a boot 
of Charles of Sweden." ...

From The Rambler, numbers 10 and 82 (reissue, Philadelphia, 1827).

lexicon, analog


http://www.asondheim.org/rottate.mp4
- in this a segment is repeated diachronically (temporally).
  if segment = S, then we have S*n - n repetitions
http://www.asondheim.org/maudmachine.mp4
- in this a single segment is constructed synchronically (spatially).
  space collapses onto itself; if space = S then we have S*x = S.

So there'a a _vocabulary_ constructed here, against which Poser/motion
capture, Blender, etc. plays.

http://www.asondheim.org/maudmachine.mp4 - at least in a while this should 
be up. It's very simple reverse echo set to 'maximum' but you can see 
where this is going, how it would work w/ poser, or with even a vocabulary 
/ calligraphy of the figure - meanwhile for me it's uncannily beautiful, 
Maud suspended in space

Meanwhile I've been working mainly with a short piece of the Maud material
which I'll make into an .mp4 either tonight or tomorrow; the rendering is
horrendous. It's simple but works. The tapes together constitute almost a
lexicon of figuration - it's hard to explain, but there are so many possi-
bilities, in terms of video, but also aesthetics, philosophy...

I'm unclear about the nature of the fetish in the construction of the 
original tapes, in which stage left/right, horizontal/vertical, closeup/ 
distance interplay in a semiotics of desire outlined by the bar-barriers 
of the material; I see this as minimal signs of humans on a planet within 
which they remain benign, localized.

Just got down humming through the 15 mini-dvs, and will begin working more
with them now. Your roof, the flute silhouette solo, the picnic, all are
cinematic, perhaps a story in that -

flattening and epistemo-ontological differences

i move between epistemology and ontology without even recognising the 
difference, since for me conceptual necessity equals natural necessity. an 
interesting case of confusion of ontology and epistemology is hermeneu- 
tics. since for me conceptual necessity equals natural necessity in this 
respect, epistemology cannot be investigated without regard to what there 
is. metaphysics, or alternatively ontology, is that branch of philosophy 
where the central concept of feminist epistemology is that of a situated 
knower. in order to make any progress in epistemology or ontology, i 
claim, one assumes that, belief in god is like our belief that two plus 
two equals four. ontology is the study of what there is, two useful 
additions are functions and predicate functionals. and so, we place the 
study of epistemology immediately before ontology. this would be where 
epistemology equals ontology, knowing = being. this would be the pearl of 
great price, if satan were interpreted as duality. epistemology is the 
study of how we know what we know. ontological issues revolve around the 
nature of the phenomenon we are seeking to know. epistemology is the 
philosophical theory of knowledge, ie, the study of knowledge. ontology is 
the theory of the nature of being and existence, ie, the application of 
knowledge to epistemology. contemporary cognitive psychology ignores both 
epistemology and ontology. a claim which is commonly made is that the 
science of cognition is concerned with a convenient overarching rubric of 
philosophical concerns; however, it is the triad of axiology, epistemol- 
ogy, and metaphysics/ontology that formulate its absolute foundation, 
flattening. lets distinguish first between epistemology and ontology. 
epistemology studies the nature of knowledge which actually means how we 
conceive our existence. lets distinguish first between epistemology and 
ontology. epistemology studies the nature of knowledge which actually 
means how we conceive our essence as well. nevertheless, i wish to do so.

origins of dance

lying there in rapture, dreaming so deep among all our worlds and 
worldings,
in which as is natural, bodies interpenetrate and the true nature
of dance is revealed

http://www.asondheim.org/dreem.mp4
http://www.asondheim.org/dremm.mp4

for which reason most dancers are hypocrites
keeping themselves to themselves and their limbs to their limbs
keeping their mouths to their mouths and their hands to their hands

ignoring the content of dance, that is the holes of the body
and their expulsions and retentions, their immersions and penetrations

distributions among their theatricalities
i can tell all of this from the depths of sleep
you can hear all of this from the depths of your sleep

when your holes open to my own
where the dance originates
when the dance begins

the Thing is


the Thing is < to what extent can one _explore_ dance, the body, the 
body's sexuality, Dionysian register? outside of literature, where the 
Thing resides, or the problematizing of the Obscene relegated, within the 
register of, the Thing. dance for example is always already an institution 
- well defined, over-determined, encapsulated. censorship requires that 
each and every production possess an _edge_ in relation to legality, which 
necessarily contaminates any investigation or presentation: the Law pre- 
sents itself within unknown territory, which it encapsulates. the limit- 
point of dance and sexuality dancing is indiscriminate fucking, display - 
against the Law, in deliberate ignorance of propriety, etiquette, in favor 
of culture as prolongation of the species _only,_ whose laws are therefore 
localized. how to sidestep this? what is a presentation, an audience, dif- 
fering on every occasion, at variance with, in tension with, the perform- 
er, performance? careers are at stake: fill the holes and lose a grant, 
empty the holes, and suffer the indignities of arrest, incomprehension, 
midnight phone-calls and invitations. one a dancer is pornographic, once 
the body is splayed / displaced in its inconceivability, there is no 
turning-back, no retreat: the future builds on evidence. yet _without_ 
this splay / display, dance, photography, culture, art in general, is a 
lie, transforming impulse into acceptable eroticism and taste. we are 
painted and repainted by culture; our 'natural attitude' is at a far re- 
move from anything within the limitlessness of the symbolic or pool of the 
imaginary. the further we mount technology and the virtual, the further we 
are mounted, rule-driven, protocol-governed - the further the clean and 
proper body prepares itself for clean and proper laws, death-by-absence 
only. go out on a limb: it is your own. where the limb joins the body, 
aye, there's the rub of it. the Thing is not a Thing; the Thing is not 
there, not Other, not here at all. and forget, among other things, the 
enjoyment of arousal, arousal-art, aroused-artist/viewer/listener - 
aroused participant - that will be fought, contaminated, transformed into 
subterfuge. at best one can accept the diagrammation of arousal - what 
else is psychoanalysis good for - the process or culmination-process is as 
invisible as semen on stage, spurted from dancer, welcomed and returned by 
audience-participants. this is the most familiar territory in the history 
of art, of dance, of the body; it is also the most unknown. draw a vector; 
follow it; starve to death; flesh transformed and its dessicate - we're 
left with it, given it, one and all, one for all, all for One, and it's 
gone. the Thing abhors One; refuses to recognize One; undermines its pol- 
itical agenda. where the One is, the Thing is not; where the Thing is 
knotted, the One self-decomposes, deconstructs on the way to forgetting.

and is any of this more than: revolt, pay the cost, disappear? shall it 
end _here_ where the limb begins? shall it end within? this is the surface 
appurtenance-appearance; this is what the dancer, photographer, performer, 
does, those under the aegis of the real-imaginary, the re/presentation or 
mapping of the most private body into/onto the limelight. 

the audience might give a whore for it, sex-slave of either sex, might 
barter or proffer, might just take, might kill, might extinguish, might 
just rape, might tear limb from limb, limb from hole, hole from limb. but 
the audience might just give a vote against it, law against it, might 
close it down, dream it up, dream it down. the wager of sin is sin, the 
wager transformed. 

and what of the _inconceivable_ Thing? what of the delirium of impossible 
and displaced topologies, higher-dimensional entities projected and flat- 
tened in our tawdry space of the real? for if the dance-dancer emerge _out 
the other end_ of this aporia, there's always movement against itself, 
splay to the nth-degree, body turned inside out. so the performer has no 
more secrets - they're in the audience, in the first or second row, all 
the way back to the balcony. the dance-dancer's wasted, used-up - that's 
hir power - exhausted - there's no turning back - there's nothing left of 
hir, nothing the audience doesn't know, doesn't dream of that very night, 
from that night forth -

the oldest of dreams - that is to _say_ - the fury of couplings, of the 
fits and fittings of bodies, of the generation of substance and the sub- 
stance of generation. this lurks within, beside, beneath, each and every 
performance, each and every mouth we speak. there is no Other; there are 
only holes, endless holes, endless wholes.

Wasteland


re John von Neumann, The Computer and the Brain - analog computer - "each 
number is represented by a suitable physical quantity" - in the digital 
machine there are markers and combinations. Consider the former a calcu- 
lation which is _intrinsic_ to the material world and the latter, one that 
is _extrinsic._ Then the former also embodies temporality - there is a 
necessity for movement-vectors of material objects; I would argue (here's 
the rub) that the latter displaces or flattens temporality. The simplest 
example - an analog watch, a digital clock - in the former, temporality is 
constituted by indexicality ranging over a _field_ within which projects 
forward and backward are simultaneously visible - and in the latter, only 
imminence appears - 10:42 does not constitute a vector or transformation 
but an abstracted and flattened quantity. Admittedly, the quantity _means_ 
only by virtue of difference, but the difference - and difference itself - 
is negated. In the analog situation, the field is the matrix of difference 
which is memory, moving, movement. In the digital, pure function to the 
nth-degree of tolerance. In both, deployment and poetics of temporality 
within which functionality is a residue - the reason for example for so 
many chimes and bells - divisions external to the dial-field, divisions in 
concert with labor.

The same phenomenologies occur in considering GPS and atlas navigators. 
The former presents the imminent situation of the user (i.e. "you are 
here") in relation to a sketched immediate surrounding (just as the 
digital clock presents "you are now" - the split between synchronic and 
diachronic almost too neat); the latter presents the field within which 
the user must locate hirself - a field extending to the edge of the page 
and beyond. The same is also of course true for the GPS, but the imminent 
positioning of the GPS is over-determined; the map is centered on the user 
or hir goal, the map is a production of the user though the GPS for the 
user, or a production of the GPS in accord or upon the command of the 
user. Like the analog clock, the GPS screen disappears with shutdown; the 
imaginary of the screen retreats within the real artifact.

To some extent we are considering only a _moment_ within the digital, 
which can map anything anywhere; online maps for example are becoming 
increasingly detailed, and NASA's WorldWind is as good a simulacrum of the 
planet as one is likely to get. The difference between analog and digital 
is increasingly abolished as raster, bandwidth, and databases increase. It 
is within the digital-personal, watches and portable GPS, that the dis- 
tinction is likely to remain; even personal video/music players are 
approaching the analog millennium. The greater the convergence, the 
greater the databases and technologies at work, the more labor-intensive 
the information regime, the more porous and vulnerable. The distinction 
becomes a memory, revealed only when something goes wrong, and the digital 
body opens, not to plumbing, chemistry and substance, but to electronic 
technologies. And here, too, the distinction converges as bodies take on 
the characteristics of cyborg-avatars, and the possibility of organic 
computers and displays increases. Thus the world is all image, all screen, 
complexity intertwined beneath surfaces; thus the world is porous and 
vulnerable itself, susceptible to hacking and axing, conceivable and 
inconceivable onslaughts. Just as the nervous system is both digital and 
analog, so is the perceptual apparatus (by which I mean from sensor to and 
through sensed); one can imagine a horizon of continuous images, sleeps, 
dreams, stasis, and eternal death. So let us think of _distinction_ itself 
as a stage or moment in time: Lo, the Other will become One, and the One, 
Other, and all, or none at all, will bear silent witness to Absence.

* projections of torn avatars over furiously moving dancers

* projections of dismembered avatars over propellers and gratings

* nomadic tent located on the hardened gallery floor full-sized with video

* one to three half-tents with field telephone/s within. or scanner radios
or electronic debris

* murmured texts played back from scattered monitors hardly organized
or present in space of every one a murderer

* or texts assembled on cds and played back from cds


* >>> THE GREATER THE NUMBER OF : MONITORS / SPEAKERS/ AMPLIFIERS / CD 
PLAYERS / DVD PLAYERS / COMPUTERS - the better : an increasingly chaotic 
space of images/sounds (think of kristeva's chora, clashing drives, the 
pre-oedipal pre-linguistic - the inherent violence of language).

-- but on a technical level, difficulties:

getting the equipment
running the equipment

so that perhaps there should be signs - within or near the tents -

the variant


http://www.asondheim.org/chasm.mp4

from the end of XXV, Legge's Chuang Tzu: 

"Birth, before it comes, cannot be prevented; death, when it has happened, 
cannot be traced farther. Death and life are not far apart; but why they 
have taken place cannot be seen. That some one has caused them, or that 
there has been no action in the case are but speculations of doubt. When I 
look for their origin, it goes back into infinity; when I look for their 
end, it proceeds without termination. Infinite, unceasing, there is no 
room for words about (the Tao). To regard it as in the category of things 
is the origin of the language that it is caused or that it is the result 
noting; but it would end as it began with things. The Tao cannot have a 
(real) existence; if it has, it cannot be made to appear as if it had not. 
The name Tao is a metaphor, used for the purpose of description. To say 
that it causes or does nothing is but to speak of one phase of things, and 
has nothing to do with the Great Subject. If words were sufficient for the 
purpose, in a day's time we might exhaust it; since they are not suffic- 
ient, we may speak all day, and only exhaust (the subject of) things. The 
Tao is the extreme to which things conduct us. Neither speech nor silence 
is sufficient to convey the notion of it. Neither by speech nor by silence 
can our thoughts about it have their highest expression."

The chasm is the variant of the Other, and each of these texts and images 
are variants of others; the variant-machine has been set into operation; 
one after another are set forth; a set is established; a style, genre, and 
canon, are established; there is no original; words are insufficient. We 
may create, day and night, the variant, of which everything is such; we 
may do nothing; we might have destroyed; we might have been destroyed; we 
might have been at variance. But there is no original of original, no 
variance of variance. 

http://www.asondheim.org/scan27.mp4 There is only a loss of insight, dim- 
inution of creative force, defuge, exhaustion, the easy way out, of which 
the easiest lies at the bottom and top of the variant; of the heap of 
variants; of the contusions of the world; of that imminence of the lost; 
of that immanence of the lost; of nothing lost, nothing gained; everything 
lost and gained. From the pure, the turbid emerges; from the turbid , the 
pure, like a dead disassociated eye come to life; an immobilized eye; the 
variant of such; of eyes; of immobilizations. Here is one thing; there is 
another; there is one thing, here is another. Language neither separates 
nor units; it is a continuous collocation, collocations, of variants; 
language itself is a variant; of languages; of others; of insufficiencies; 
of sounds, noise, murmurs, cries, rattles, crashes, shrieks, winds, waves, 
clouds and oceans. The variant has no limits; the variant-machine does not 
exists, the imaginary accounting of the variant; as if to curtail the 
limitless; as if to inhere. Of which the Tao has not spoken, already the 
exercise, exorcizing, of the historical, hysterical, already writing, 
already corrected, emended, erased, obscured, teleology reversed, nothing 
of the origin, nothing of the end.

4-four catastrophe machine in motion capture

4 stationary points with picking up and putting down and rearrangement
18/4 sensors motion capture: _the language returns from the other side_ - 
sudden jumps - hyperbolic space - infinite manifolds - closed but yes at 
the edges - the corners - elsewhere - beyond anything conceivable - the 
body is a compass - the body tends - this way and that way - take a gander 
- a look-see - variants on and off the field - of discourse - space-time - 
points holding everything back - master or matrix - murmur - the semaphore 
of the black hole - nietzsche -

killer sons - victim fathers - semiotics of the woman - literally the cusp 
catastrophe - or butterfly - the catastrophe machine - in one end and out 
the other - heideggerian four-fold holding in abeyance - moves every so

To be in and of the cradle of consciousness within a closely infinite 
relationship to extensive time and space, slicing through that, in order 
that _this_ consciousness among all others speaks and writes within _this_ 
plane of infinitesimal appearance, disappearance - space and time of the 
womb, of the closely infinite walls of the womb, vagina, matrix, concavity 
of the chora, closed off, momentary defense or fortification. But among 
this that infinite sky which consciousness comprehend, well, that is 
understood, understandable, but the question and answering of _this_ 
consciousness, of the sense of _my_ fingers, or fingers under my control, 
lending themselves in the midst of the inconceivable plenitude of worlds, 
this splay or embracing in the guise of wonder, this opening which is so 
inconceivably peripheral to existence, that its questioning is always 
already absent before the enunciation...
