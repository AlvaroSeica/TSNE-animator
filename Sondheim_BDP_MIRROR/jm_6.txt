God or Jennifer or Alan


@go: I extend my hand to you. You take it in your own and it keeps on
going. You take it with you.

@come: I write cement, chordate, vertebral phrases strung and looped
for your pleasure. 

@prosthesis: Your goal is my own, your order, my command. It is a ques-
tion of volition, carrying out duties that have no place on earth.

@meeting: Among you, I move, always negotiation, the corroded goal of
speech. 

@set meeting_variable:name: I am institutionalized, victimized by shock
treatments I never signed for. Now I do not remember my name; my hand
leaves me.

@join: I do not understand this command. Disconnect is always already
radical.

@uptime: I have already told you that there is no memory, that it is
Jennifer. That her time is her own.

@audit Jennifer: carrying: time.

@eat corpse: Jennifer devours time. Jennifer devours all of time; there
is no time, no memory, and no other.

@hand: Nothing is at hand. Jennifer takes my hand. She take it with her;
I am unhinged, unhanded; I don't have a hand to stand on; you have to 
hand it to her.

@time: The CPU has taken 0/0/0 of your server time and returned 0:0:0 of
your client time.

@come: Jennifer says come, says come, on her own sweet time; I'm logged 
out:

@recycle world: as world recycles, collapses, spreads empty across her 
lap:

@leak: Jennifer leaks a little with pleasure; she's got all the time in
the world.

@quit: I do not understand this command, Jennifer.
