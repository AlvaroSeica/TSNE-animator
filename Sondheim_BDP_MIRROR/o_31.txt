How I'm not a Universal Listening-Post to the World-Wide_Web


I've developed tinnitus, a continuous ringing of the ears, the sound of a
high-pitched motor, in both. I have been to the doctor who said that my
hearing was normal and that I would have to live with this. I am living
with an engine, always present, not so loud as to block other sounds, but
a disturbance nonetheless. There are two interacting frequencies and long
drifting waves of amplitude, and the tinnitus seems insensitive to temp-
erature and humidity; the sound, like that produced by the drone in Indian
music, is always _there,_ which translates into _here,_ a kind of intimacy
that I have tried to relate as well to the background radiation of the un-
iverse, the originary Word creating and destroying. No such luck, nor is
it, no matter how much I want to believe, a sound truly electrical in na-
ture, reflecting my time spent on the wires, the net, square-waves demon-
strative of packets roaring down the wires somewhere near the speed of
light in vacuo. Instead of ringing the transendent, in fact, tinnitus only
imitates and configures it; instead of re-sounding with absolute and univ-
ersal truths, tinnitus reflects a malfunctioning physiology of the subject
refusing _all_ truths, including the problematic of its own being. Since
there is no discernible damage, the tinnitus will continue until either I,
or _it,_ whatever that happens to be, burns out; in the meantime I can 
pretend to a hampered and very minor god.
