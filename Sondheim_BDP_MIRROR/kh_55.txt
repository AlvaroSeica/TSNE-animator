About your faces (I will have a breakdown every night, a sure sign!) -

You are all faces, and when I ride the subway, I see more of them, and
they are sounding themselves and saying "faces" and they go on and on, I
have a strict idea that they continue before and after the subway. But I
see faces, and I know this, as I write to myself, as I was saying to my-
self just now, I am so animated! I, Nikuko, am so animated! I have a face
and it is a living thing. When I see your faces, I see nothing. I am dead-
girl-Nikuko, and there is nothing to see. When I see my face, I, Nikuko,
am so animated! I am so animated! 

(I am waiting to die! I am your parasite! I am invisible and useless! I am
murderer, priestess, suicide. I travel through the slit! The slit in your
face which yawks! There's nothing to see. Sometimes I feel my death so
strong I can't feel your face or yawk. Well, what about the slit? The slit
just opens and closes. It spits out demons. It's a Maxwell. it says. It
says it over and over again. There's sense on the other side. I hate me. 
I will die!)
