The pun is simultaneously a thickening and derailing of language - it
draws attention to language-meat - the _sound of things_ which returns (as
if the repressed) the homophone. Something enteres from somewhere else by
virtue of (what appears to be) nothing more than happenstance. Language
boils over.

In a similar manner, codework constructs surface and sub-surface, centri-
fuge and subterfuge - flight in the form of transversals across meaning.
Code presencing itself is always already surface, as if the bones, in
showing through, contribute to language's wounding of the residue of the
real.

Of Coin


On a phenomenological level, we live within the horizon of universal caus-
ation, stochastic phenomena notwithstanding. Origins are given as such
because they appear determined; the truth of the matter, however - the
_truth of matter_ - is that causation is problematic; as cosmology app-
roaches t(0), it becomes more and more dubious - paralleling the breakdown
of spacetime in the small. Our worlds, perceptions, are residues at best.  
We shall find nothing at the origin, no function, null - not even annihil-
ation.

We live within the horizon of universal apocalypse, local organization
notwithstanding. Azure and I cuddle together; we are co-dependent, having
these few moments before worlds collapse. The imminent destruction of life
is close to certain; a decade seems a stretch. Humans were given the seed
of catastrophe in the very possibility of nuclear and biochemical physics.  
We grasp each other furiously, our eyes not yet blanked out. We live with-
in the residues, find nothing at infinity, no function, null - not even
annihilation.

If


If Auschwitz hadn't happened, if September were another,
I'd say that you were mine, I'd say we'd stay together,
In any darkness, weather; if Beirut were filled with flowers, 
Jerusalem a town, I'd say we'd live forever, I'd say we'd be together;
If Afghanistan were peaceful, if America were other,
I'd say we're made for one another, I'd say eternity;
If Rwanda never happened, Sudan were prosperous,
I'd say we'd love forever, I'd say a god was there, so glorious in us;
If Israel were milk, and Palestine of honey, and China were so sweet,
We'd lie together there, I'd say you were the rose, 
All among the fairest; if one voice hadn't happened, 
Another took its place, I'd say your name forever, 
And we would live forever; if September were another, 
A day of bright fall weather, if Auschwitz hadn't happened,
In any darkness, weather, I'd say that we were peaceful,
I'd say eternity, if animals still roamed free, if there were animals,
I'd say a god was there, so glorious in us, all among the fairest;
If one voice hadn't happened, another took its place.

The Truth of Magic (A Note)


The Truth of Magic, may I be the first to reveal it, is that Houdini is 
heroic, not for exposing the various mechanisms and pretenses involved in 
the application of entertainment and trickery - but for deflecting the 
Spiritual Aspects of what we do - as if it were nothing more than doll, 
puppet, machine. The Truth of Magic is that Magic is true, not slight-of- 
hand; it has been our gift to allay the fears of Gentlemen and Ladies, 
presenting ourselves as powerless, even impotent. But nothing is farther 
from the Truth; Houdini could move mountains, and those illusionists on 
television and stage are in fact doing what they promise. The world is 
full of Illusion - 'tis true - but the Illusion is that of mechanism, not 
Spirit. 

Thus I break with the Ranks of our great Secrecy, Yours, etc. etc.

Berda'awat, biar-lah hitam; mandi, biar-lah basah.

If you get inked, get black; if you bathe, get wet.

(Malay proverb, from Winstedt, A Simple Malay Reader)

If you write, write to the fullest; if you burn, conflagrate; if you swim,
dive. If you get inked, get black: write into the maelstrom, conflagrate.  
If you bathe, breathe, get wet, drown; if you drink, drown; if you write,
write down with bodies floating in the stream of stories. If you drown,
you drown; if you write, you're written. Write and you drown; if you get
ink, your lungs fill with darkness: black ink, and you get black.

 our love


 self-deprecation going nowhere, there must be a space for structure, not
 anecdote

 audience [laugh] [applause]

 surely you must think, mr. sondheim, that you are stale and have covered
 everything, is it not? it is not.

 is it something else, mr. sondheim. [shrug] [jump]

 yes and surely. we are packing up to leave this life. i cannot think.
 there are crickets and sand midges everywhere. my body is a sieve.

 you are a saint, mr. sondheim. [laugh] [kiss]

 thank you for your consideration. but i have no more stories, i am lazy
 to program, i have no conditions. i must 

 audience [query] [yes]

 i must complete my theoretical work so that it is bone, not marrow;
 spine, not tissue, earth, not inconceivable and wobbling space

 mr. sondheim, we are with you in our heart. you are a genius and you must
 do this. we applaud your effort to write when you are packing up to leave
 this life.

 audience [applause] [consternation]

 do not fear, i will work through this with my customary and tremendous
 courage, i will not disappoint

 of course you will not, mr. sondheim, you have never done but brilliant
 through the most amazing consequences that would have haunted and
 weakened anyone else

 audience [empathetic] [poor mr. sondheim]

 but it is true, it is the most slightest true, that i will be doing a
 disappointment to myself, unless i am packing up less and thinking of our
 world and its terrible needs and wants so much more, that i will stop
 packing up and thinking of my theoretical work which is so very important
 to you

 audience [agreement] [wonderful applause]

 i know i can count on you and i promise i will never let you down, i
 would rather my heart shatter and my limbs turn leprous than i will let
 you down, which i will not.       

 you are so brave mr. sondheim, i cannot believe how brave you are in this
 dark world, and we are eager readers of your theoretical work, which will
 make us better people who will know about the dark world 

 audience [thankful] [eternally grateful]

 thank you thank you, i will produce the greatest work and i will cease
 leaving and will remain forever in your hearts and my books and every
 other writing

 audience [more than thankful] [jump] [wonderfully put]

 that was wonderfully put, mr. sondheim, thank you, thank you, thank you.

what i heard, in the last two days, of the last days

gouge out eyes, the women are whores, mine the towns, bomb the fields, the
jews are coming, the jews are going, i tasted all the protocols, i saw it
with my running feet, i dream you jews, i dream you women, i dream you
children, i read it on the internet, i saw it in the newspaper, i heard it
on the radio, i touched it on the television, i tasted every jew in sight,
i smelled each and every woman, blood is filth and pain, jews are filth
and pain, women are filth and pain, they're marked in the middle of the
month, walk the streets of any city, look around you, it's purim, haid,
passover, there's danger in the streets, i can hear the danger, i can hear
the danger -:everywhere, they're killing children, jews need young and
kosher meat, five-year-olds are good for books, books are a new and newer
language, they've got it figured in the book, they do their figures in the
book, they're eaten by the jews, i smelled it on the television, i touched
it on the internet, clean yourself with stones, make sure they're three or
more and always odd, die beneath the stones, jews, you're eating children,
look at little hugh of lincoln, you're teeth are filled with others'
flesh, all women are filthy, all women are unclean, jewish men bleed once
a month, they hide everywhere -:tie up the natural blood of women, the
jews are eating children again; seclude the children and the women, tie up
the natural blood of women, it's purim time, it's passover, it's haid,
she's filthy as the filthy jews, they're tying up women, they're tying up
children to eat them - they do that for their filthy rites, i read it on
the radio, i heard it on the newspaper -::

oh daughters sons of blood, there is no place to flee on earth, beneath
the rain of bombs, there is nowhere left to go, everyone will kill thee!
oh daughters sons of blood, there is no place to flee on earth, beneath
the rain of bombs, there is nowhere left to go, everyone will kill thee!

our marriage


azure and i wear broad weddings rings. azure is packing now as we plan on
leaving miami. before the rings people wouldn't know what to think. he's
the dancer we worked with on occasion. i allow myself caffeine. i am
fearfully afraid of growing up. i introduce her as my wife. i think the
way i thought at twenty-five and she is twenty-five. i try and take care
of my health the best i can. i was sitting with foofwa and azure. i watch
my diet closely and don't drink or smoke or take drugs. i will die long
before she will in all probability. i work every day as long as i can. i
worry about losing my capacities through stroke or heart attack. i worry
about the length of our marriage because i will die. i would never seek
nirvana and i would always return. it's as if we have just a little time
together on this earth. other people quickly find out how well we
communicate. our friends have no problems accepting us. our love runs deep
through all traumatic weathers. our love survives through everything.
people don't know what to make of it. people would assume she was my
daughter. reincarnation shows you the earth and its great story.
retirement is nothing more than wasted days and wasted nights. she will
always know my future and i will never know her future. she will be in her
prime most likely when i die. sometimes i see myself in her for decades
after i am dead. sometimes someone would flirt with her when we were
together. the difference amounts to thirty-three years and several months.
the difference in our ages is more than three decades. the difference will
be less and then more pronounced. the marriage will not be one in which we
grow old together. the nude photography disturbs people. their ages added
up to mine. there are boxes everywhere and i can hear her in the
background. there are incomprehensible decades in our pasts and futures.
there are positive and negatives everywhere in this wide world. there are
some things one can't do without. there is a great bridge connecting our
pasts and futures together. there will always be sicknesses and healths.
they were closer in age. they were unnerved and uneasy. this is a secret
message for azure. we have to go through things other couples don't. we
speak through and into each other just as the rings reflect. we will
reflect on our past and future lives. we would come together and move
apart and return once again. we would watch each other in life after life.
we wouldn't change it for an instant. when i die she will have all my
belongings around her. who is using who and is anyone really using anyone.
