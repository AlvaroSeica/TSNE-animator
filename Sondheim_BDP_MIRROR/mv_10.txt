madness of organs


the madness of organs. the organist takes care of things. the organist 
watches the keyboard. she watches her hands on the keyboard. she takes 
care of higher keys and lower keys. her hands move apart and return in 
fugue. the organist is in fugue state. he commands the air we breathe. he 
siphons the air. the air is siphoned by the organist. his passion is 
controlled by the process of pressing a key. the key is pressed and held. 
holding the key down, the organist controls a column of air. he commands 
the reeds of metal and bodies of wood. she is obsessed over a beautiful 
boy. her hair streams in the wind. she plays the organ naked. her breasts 
thrust forward with the stroke of keys. the boy is wounded in flanders 
field. the boy is dying. he is obsessed with her. he thinks he is ugly and 
disfigured. he plays madly. he is in a state of fugue. 

i am that organist in a state of fugue. i am surrounded by beautiful girls 
and boys. i am utterly mad in my columns of air. i command the atmosphere. 
i command the world of metal and wood. the organ towers above me. the 
organ is a great loudness in the world. the organ broadcasts my obsession 
and passion. the organ is a great tower unto mankind. 

my long hair falls on the keys. my thick blond hair falls on the keys. my
thick black hair falls on the keys. the beautiful boy will come and hear
my playing and take me in his arms.
