Parable of the Cords of the Word _Inari_


Daishin Nikuko wished very much for a child. One day she ate a peach, not
knowing it was a magical peach. At night it would have glowed slightly,
but she was hungry in the day, and it looked quite ordinary. I Daishin
Nikuko am writing this. The peach tasted delicious and she spit out the
pit, which was quite shiny, with magic letters on it, in fact _Inari_ for
the fullness of the harvest. Daishin Nikuko galloped away, leaving a stir-
rup behind, and from this sprang ten-thousand torii, Shinto arches. Having
eaten of the peach, she gave birth to the child Daishin Nikuko. One day a
peach tree grew from the pit, and this was the origin of the orchard, a
forest in the form of ten-thousand torii, as well as of the Inari shrines.

From the birth of Daishin Nikuko came the blind monk killed by the mother
Daishin Nikuko; from this, sprang the sorrows of the world. From the moth-
er and the daughter came the name Daishin Nikuko, who has lived in me in
Nakasukawabata for these many years of my life. It was said of me, born
with the death of my mother, that I am neither here nor there. It is said
of me that I am Peachboy, Momotaro, and this said of me when I am on the
Noh stage in disguise, my full breasts bound by cords, and nothing visible
but the blind eyes of the monk, my father.
