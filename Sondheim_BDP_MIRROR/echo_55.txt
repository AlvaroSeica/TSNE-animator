the wind



it is said that the parable is the most ephemeral, the weakest source of

knowledge. and for this reason, the parable is the truest source as well,

existing for the length of a breath, trembling before rumors of the abso-

lute. 



its very trembling hints at forces beyond our control, shadowy existenc-

es, ghosts of tracts purporting to describe the world flowing out beneath

them.



the source of parables, nikuko said, is the comprehending of worlds; par-

ables accomplish this through weakness and participation, bending in the

wind.
