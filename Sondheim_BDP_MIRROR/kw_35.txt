Don't stop taking your medication. Please, John, don't stop now. Please,
it's not too late. Please - you know what happens - you know what's
happened before. For God's sakes, John, please listen to reason. Please,
we're here for you - you know that. We're not your enemy. Don't you know
that? Don't you remember how much fun we used to have? Please - I'm
serious, I've never been more serious in my life. Please, there are just a
few pills a day - it doesn't take much time. You're so much nicer then.
Please - I'm worried what can happen to you. I'm worried what you'll do.
You remember what you did last time; I know you remember. Everyone
remembers. My God, John, I'm begging you personally. Do you want me to get
down on my hands and knees? Look, I'm getting down on my hands and knees.
I don't know what else to do. I spend all day and night crying over this.
Terrible things will happen if you stop taking your medication. Oh God,
please please John, please don't stop.

Jennifer
