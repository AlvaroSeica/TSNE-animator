"my thoughts hurt my head" then cause my thoughts bang against my skull
where there is very much hurt to have and nothing to help protect against
these thoughts.

which maybe aren't my thoughts but maybe come from somewhere else. which
maybe is from someone who doesn't like me. i definitely think they're from
something which doesn't like me.

which maybe are mine and are bad naughty thoughts i shouldn't have and my
head is punishing me. i definitely shouldn't have these thoughts. i defin-
itely shouldn't be having these thoughts. my thoughts shouldn't be having
me.

which maybe are so complicated, which maybe are so confusing, my head
hurts from all the work it takes to have them. they definitely aren't my
thoughts. i definitely have to work at having these thoughts and they hurt
my head. they shouldn't be hurting my head.

where are my thoughts, i can't see my thoughts, i can't touch them or feel
them. where are my thoughts, they have a small about them. i can almost
taste them. sometimes i definitely can hear my thoughts. i definitely can
hear them and they make my head hurt. i shouldn't be hearing them.
