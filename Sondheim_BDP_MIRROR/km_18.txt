Subjective Feelings of Cyberspace


Sometimes there is an experience of cold, like "'a jug of cold water
poured on the nape of the neck.' 'As if the blood was like ice in my
veins.' 'A cold, shivering feeling came over me.' The apparition 'laid a
cold hand on his cheek.' 'Her kiss was like a waft of cold air upon my
cheek.' 'She felt a cold hand clasp hers.' 'I awoke in a cold sweat.' The
percipient 'felt an icy wind blowing.' 'As if a cool wind was blowing
about me.' 'As the figure passed we distinctly felt a cold air.' Again,
'Any icy chill passed through him, and his hair bristled.' 'My hair seemed
to bristle.'" And then again there is the odd feeling of presence, "'My
eyes were fixed on my book, when suddenly I _felt,_ but did not _see,_
some one come into my room.'" (Quotes from Apparitions, G.N.M. Tyrrell.
See also the 1882 Census of Hallucinations, British Society for Psychical
Research.)

Sometimes I have felt a _nervous warmth,_ as if under a bright light,
whose illumination remained invisible to me. Sometimes I feel a sense of
_arousal,_ as if waiting for some one to come into my presence, entering
through the screen; this effect, while that of _gambling_ to an extent, is
also the sensation of a _hovering_ just out of reach. Neither wet nor dry,
my own entries onto the screen appear dry and drying to the touch; the
entries of the other always seem moistened, organic, far beyond the cool
typing that has become apparent. When I mouth the words of the other, I
tend to run too quickly on, so I will return over and over again, allowing
each syllable its proper space.

I am aware of a certain _height_ to the text as well, several inches above
the ground, spread out around the dimensions and texture of a tatami mat -
in other words, comforting, _low,_ enveloping. This countermands those
entries which sear the soft flesh, dividing cell from cell - entries of
disenchantment, when I withdraw from the screen, promising myself its
irrelevance, the fictivity of the other in relation to my own solidity,
the intensity of light streaming in the window or the sounds of nighttime
rain against the covered skylights in the loft.

I think of intermingling bodies, just as the inhalation of a perfume is a
communion from naked skin to one's own airy and moist interior. We ex-
change, not messages, but each other, in such a fashion, and the Net also
permits this dream - that these words, for example, are the far-flung
remains of a script or moment of pleasure against the otherwise real. I
always try to write the words in order to forget the words, or write the
words that tend towards their forgetting, and in such a fashion I come
towards you, words and speech as well on the periphery of something un-
namable, deeper, darker. (Not autonomy, perhaps, but the autonomic.) This
underlies the subjective feelings of cyberspace, which disappear them-
selves as so many ghosts, so that others may take their place.
