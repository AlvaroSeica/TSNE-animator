THE INVISIBLE, EMPTY INDIFFERENT THINGS, VIRTUAL SPACE, EMBODIMENT


Rilke, from letter 106 to Witold von Hulewicz:


Even for our grandfathers a house, a fountain, a familiar tower, their
very clothes, their coat, was infinitely more, infinitely more intimate;
almost every object a vessel in which they found something human or added
their morsel of humanity. Now, from America, empty indifferent things
crowd over to us, counterfeit things, the veriest dummies. A house, in the
American sense, an American apple or one of the vines of that country has
_nothing_ in common with the house, the fruit, the grape into which have
entered the hope and meditation of our forefathers. The lived and living
things, the things that share our thoughts, these are on the decline and
cna no more be replaced. _We are perhaps the last to have known such
things._ The responsibility rests with us not only to keep remembrance of
them (that would be but a trifle and unreliable), but also their human or
"laric" value ("laric," in the sense of household gods). The earth has no
alternative but to become invisibile - IN us, who with a portion of our
being have a share in the Invisible, or at least the appearance of
sharing; we who can multiply our possessions of the Invisible during our
earthly existence, in us _alone_ can there be accomplished this intimate
and continual transmutation of the Visible into the Invisible . . . just
as our own destiny becomes unceasingly MORE PRESENT, AND AT THE SAME TIME
INVISIBLE, in us.
