big winds dust storms out of Omaha near Kansas everything quiet and sul-
len. I do my reading, worry that the audience might assume that Jennifer
and company are too Net dependent. I worry about the ethics of everything.
it's a kind of writing they haven't heard before. I'm hardly there before
I'm gone on the road through ultra-fast Missouri back to Lafayette. sullen
rain on the way. I get irritated at "sullen" and pass a pickup truck at a
stop-light at 60 miles an hour. makes me feel good, hungry for more. I
dance over some hills on two-laned blacktop at 70. makes me feel better.
Jennifer's my co-pilot. _she tells me what to do._ I hear Julu shrieking
beneath the sloped and tilting fields. she's saying the whole world's on
edge. she's saying _speed._ sullen and nervous I pull in but there's a
bright spot.
