Heaving


Neural networking or artificial life, massive parallel processing simul-
taneously heaves the line or plane or n-dimensional object, stuttered
perhaps across various nodes, no dimensionality at all, but a certain
_heaving_ of affect, reiterations over and over again, a throw of the
repeatedly loaded dice. One jostles one's neighbors or others at a dis-
tance; competition occurs through strange meeting-places elsewhere in
time, or space, or level; the whole stutters or shimmers, spattered pools
of information, slower eddies eventually taking the form of an animal or 
perfect piece of information.

Spattered pools tend towards chaos; no one can tell what will emerge as
the weather turns. The body is integrated, stretched across filters and
receptors. The body is a pool seething with genetic generators, self-pro-
cessing, hungry for energy and reproduction - the skin, lungs, blood,
mind, memory - reiterating, heaving, until local system failure spreads
across the coagulation (as if it were a membrane), hairline fractures
bringing the whole to a halt. The coagulation sinks loaded into the
ground; the residue is the memory of history, itself dissolute, spattered,
in competition with the inert decay of universal capital.
