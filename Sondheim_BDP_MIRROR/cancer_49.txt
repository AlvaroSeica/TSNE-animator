i promise you i will always send out the last text written before i die
you will have a complete collection of everything i have written
nothing will be held back, nothing will remain unknown
my world is given to you, pull the theory out, assemble it
it is all there, the defuge, sexuality, transparency, linkage, coupling
the theory all there, just barely virtual in the life of nikuko
in the life of julu, the theory resides, within the life of jennifer
oh azure, my other lovers are not real, they are make-believe and mine
theory emerges, all will have all of it, my most solemn promise
no other truth is necessary, you have my complete collection
now, you have everything, this is the very last text for now
this is the very last text, at the moment nothing else
be content, hold steadfast, comprehend, receive and surrender
my promise is fulfilled, my world rendered, all revealed, perfection
promise given, residing, emerging, holding, comprehending, and surrender
