From the Logs


tulips no, commonalities, but then tulips yes, preference of weeds tulips
yes, because of strength and hardiness, pansies because of brilliant
colour no drowning, swallow nightshade-darling, then resurrection
cityscape you will come with me?  tulips pale with nightshade's longing on
red-brown lips waiting for the drowning waters no? 

no tulip because "The look of love alarms,"   
tulip because "Because 'tis fill'd with fire;"   
no drowning because "But the look of soft deceit"   
tulips and nightshade because "Shall win the lover's hire."   
so smoothing green because loving William Blake and smoothing green
