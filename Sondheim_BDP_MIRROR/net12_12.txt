GENDER PERFORMING ON AND OFF THE NET





So even if you can perform a gender, you're stuck with anatomy. You 

can add or substract a cunt or a cock, enlarge or cut free the tit,

but it's all the same, desire sloshing hormones around, chemical

mechanisms giving in. On the Net you can't create a third, but what

of it if you could? First, second, third, they are and remain eman-

ations. Do they begin or end in the arms, legs, neck or face, and

what if you couldn't use your vocal cords (talking about _I_ Lingis

says "The sign is a sound uttered with the throat or a visual mark

made by the hand. A contraction in the throat"). Or what if you 

heard this, sightless, read this in a silent world? I offer to you

that 1. Gender is not ever a switch, and sexuality is a field only

in the sense of a discursive formation circumscribed by the molecu-

lar; 2. The performance of sexuality by the body is at a loss for

mooring but always returns to the same old story; 3. Performativity

and interiority are irrevocably disjunct; 4. The body is occasioned

by its own liquidity; 5. Gender is always more boring than sex be-

cause gender _is_ that same old story, and sex is a foundering. [1]
