0: neutral
1: obdurate, there is, idiotic real
2: choice / intentionality

0: neitherness, not both A and B, neither A nor B (a priori mathesis)
1: fragility of the good: computer program error, intrinsic
2: error extrinsic, deferment

0: null set
1: universal set
2: split tending towards as-if

1-2: leakages between them
problematic metaphor [0/1/2]: numbers as markers of inscriptions,
 multiplicities, neutralities (the idiotic)

RL: 1: immersive, fundamentally dynamic (potential stases)
 - internal: operated _in_
SL: 2: definable, fundamentally static (real mobility)
 - external operators: operated _on_

Attacking the metaphor: misplaced quantification and ordering among
'plexa,' misplaced mathesis (plexus, from plico, plicatum, to fold,
to knit - Lynd's Class-Book of Etymology, 1861)

Intentionality: 
suturing in RL: cohering subjectivity, harmonic continuity, incoherent 
 and dynamic inscribing
suturing in SL: coherent physics, discordant continuity, coherent
 inscribing (it's inscription that holds it together)

Problematic ontology of SL: mathesis/inscription = what is; the world
 is a world only by virtue of its (visible, sensed) manifestation,
 information clarified and lost, backup of SL
Problematic ontology of RL: virtual particles, information entanglement
 and conservation, no backup 

Off the map i -

Nagarjuna and Madhyamaka - emptiness and dependent origination / 
dependent arising 

Off the map ii -

SL: Think of root originations in server farms, permissions and 
 specificies of address
RL: Think of fundamental ontologies under erasure, feynman diagram
 probabilities: what constitutes dependency under probability 
 distributions -

Off the map iii -

Physical ontology is always abstracted, as-if
 (SL and anti-conventionalist argument)
There is no _fundamental_ physical ontology

Off the map iv -

Mathesis and Badiou's position - relation to surreal numbers

On the map -

Thinking of SL as abstracted, split, chosen, programmed: anything that is 
programmable is possible. Thinking of RL as given, born-into: thought as 
conceiving. Consider SL _not_ as subset of RL - as fulcrum; consider SL 
as the visual counterpart of the space of Mathematica. 

Psychology, psychoanalytics of SL in this case: matrix, borromean knot, 
 meta-level jumping (collocation of constructing, dwelling-in)
The body as entangled projections/introjections (jectivity) independent
 of traditional physical constraint or representation
The locus of the body in the physical body (SL as perceptual organ)

The traditional/narratological function of SL = equivalent to cinematic
 diegesis
The non-traditional functioning of SL (above) = processes of dynamic 
 suturing
