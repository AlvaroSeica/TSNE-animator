Discussion of avatar theory and practice.

[bvh: BioVisionHierarchy file]

[6:13]  You: As an introduction, let me say that this workshop combines 
many things. It presents the history of a collaborative exploration of 
virtuality. In this, it offers one direct or hand-on approach to the 
intersection of the real and virtual...
[6:14]  You: None of this is true, none of this as matter of true. He 
and I never touch. Nothing happens here in and on a screen that plays 
out sprites and their gestures.
[6:15]  You: Alan is a pioneer in the use of computers and art, working 
in this field since at least the 1970's. One way of seeing an ongoing 
concern in Alan's work is with the "topology of intention" that he 
theorizes in his important 1977 book _The Structure of Reality_.
[6:15]  You: The dominant strain of discourse around digital technology 
tries to discover the particularities of the technology as a formalism 
or platform or medium. Sondheim's work is heterogeneous from but 
crucial to this field by insisting on the problematic intentionality of 
the digital as a lifeworldly domain in which we ex-ist...
[6:15]  You: Alan began coming to WVU in 2003 and soon began intensive 
collaboration with Sandy Baldwin of WVU's Center for Literary 
Computing, and with WVU's Virtual Environments Lab, directed by Frances 
van Scoy. ..
[6:16]  You: Students at the graduate and undergraduate level were 
involved as well, some from computer science, others from English or 
visual arts. Additional collaborators joined from the Intermedia 
program at WVU's Creative Arts Center, and most recently from the 
GeoVirtual lab in WVU's Geography department. ....
[6:16]  You: Through this interdisciplinary mixing of tools and 
collaborators, Alan radically imagined the uses of virtual technology 
at WVU. Of course, there's a long tradition of creative misuse of 
technology.
[6:16]  You: The aesthetics of the glitch music, for example, explores 
the misuse of the CD. There's an initial similarity in Alan's work 
here: working against the seeming purpose of the tools, refusing the 
normative bodies mapped into these virtual spaces, wild dancing and 
utterance in spaces where we are supposed to be still and silent before 
the machine, an _ethical_ insisting on the pressure and weight and yet 
ineluctable absence of the body in virtuality.
[6:16]  You: But it would not be wrong to insist that a distinction be 
made: misuse or glitch is not the goal but means for consciousness and 
intention to problematize their inhabitation of the technology. This is 
seance and tantra.
[6:17]  You: The results are inspiring, awesome. They are also utterly 
alien, but alien in the sense of the alien that I am and that inhabits 
me and that is there when I shed the skins of habit.
[6:17]  You: The results can be understood as works, works of art. They 
are works, as well, of the real and the virtual, worked over 
virtualities, so that the work of art is trembling with the work of the 
artist. The result are endless and undetermined.
[6:17]  You: They form in chains and links from dancing bodies to 
clouds of code to avatars to writings and on and on. 
[6:20]  Alan Dojoji: I'm interested in the relationship between 
conscious and formal systems.
[6:20]  Alan Dojoji: That should be consciousness - in other words, the 
relationship between how we think and how we think we think
[6:20]  Alan Dojoji: and the way the world is
[6:20]  Alan Dojoji: And it seems to me that working with avatars, 
which can be
[6:21]  Alan Dojoji: as much a projection of our 'selving' as our own 
bodies -
[6:21]  Alan Dojoji: both work with images, projections and 
introjections -
[6:21]  Alan Dojoji: both work with visual perception to a great 
extent, locating ourselves visually in a world
[6:21]  Alan Dojoji: and both work with forgetting - that is forgetting 
the body - when I speak in a conversation
[6:22]  Alan Dojoji: I'm ignoring my own hmmm... way of arranging my 
limbs, etc.; I'm "just talking" and listening
[6:22]  Alan Dojoji: So that occurs in and across these realms -
[6:22]  Alan Dojoji: Our relationship to formal systems is related to 
how we make sense of the world.
[6:23]  Alan Dojoji: We use systems, gestural systems, autonomic 
systems, conscious and preconscious systems, etc., to make sense of 
things; if we can't make sense, we begin to feel stress, anxiety
[6:23]  Alan Dojoji: and this can further lead to one or another form 
of collapse, perhaps catatonia
[6:23]  Alan Dojoji: To make sense of the world we have to consider our 
bodies, our selves. It's clear for example that a 'healthy body' sees 
the world differently than a sick one
[6:24]  Alan Dojoji: This is important - most philosophy or thnking of 
any sort presupposes a healthy body however that's defined, which may 
be very different from one culture to another and may not in fact 
'record' or describe the world well at all
[6:24]  Alan Dojoji: For example, that a depressed mind senses a 
different world than, say, an optimist would.
[6:25]  Alan Dojoji: In fact one might argue that depression is a 
"truer" way of seeing the world than a more rational 'surface' one
[6:25]  Alan Dojoji: We're further driven by desires; even the 
development or discovery of a formal system is dependent upon our 
wanting to develop or discover such.
[6:25]  Alan Dojoji: Desire seems to underpin everything, and of course 
'desire' itself is a word up for grabs
[6:26]  Alan Dojoji: It seems to have components of abjection, 
sexuality, instinct, survival skills etc.
[6:26]  Alan Dojoji: I keep hearing the term but not much of a deep 
description or phenomenology
[6:26]  Alan Dojoji: Desires are like icebergs - their ostensible 
content might be the peak above the sea, but beneath the surface lies 
darker matter, abject matter.
[6:26]  Alan Dojoji: By "abject" I mean matter that is partly of us, 
constituted by us, and partly debris -
[6:26]  Alan Dojoji: This is where the noise or dirt of the world
[6:26]  Alan Dojoji: is descvribed
[6:27]  Alan Dojoji: It's this matter that I'm interested in, the 
abject or obscenity that makes us human, even beyond the guise or 
presentation of language.
[6:27]  Alan Dojoji: In some senses language is a surface phenomenon
[6:27]  Alan Dojoji: In some senses what lies beneath is the "true 
world" within the guise of the civil,
[6:27]  Alan Dojoji: or the guise of etiquette
[6:27]  Alan Dojoji: or the guise of protocol
[6:27]  Alan Dojoji: Even online, shape-riding on this level is very 
different
[6:28]  Alan Dojoji: than someone hacking the machine at a lower level
[6:28]  Alan Dojoji: Where things are being bent in secret, hidden
[6:28]  Alan Dojoji: One can almost say that's the tantric level which 
must be imagined
[6:28]  Alan Dojoji: or can be imagined
[6:28]  Alan Dojoji: and then discarded
[6:28]  Alan Dojoji: after having been devoured or eaten
[6:29]  Alan Dojoji: (The face on the associative object with me is 
that of YAMANTAKA who is the destroyer of death)
[6:29]  Alan Dojoji: Now to the virtual - bear with me, this is going 
somewhere
[6:29]  Alan Dojoji: The virtual is everywhere, the virtual is 
symbolic, inscription, an index of our relationship with the real. Our 
bodies are as virtual as anything online; we're a mess of codes and 
protccols, languages, drives, instincts, communications, cries and 
warnings.
[6:29]  Alan Dojoji: Recently language has been related to gesture, 
which brings it closer to the body - I'll repeat
[6:29]  Alan Dojoji: The virtual is everywhere, the virtual is 
symbolic, inscription, an index of our relationship with the real. Our 
bodies are as virtual as anything online; we're a mess of codes and 
protccols, languages, drives, instincts, communications, cries and 
warnings.
[6:30]  Alan Dojoji: There's nothing about us that isn't caressed by 
language, that isn't languaging. There's nothing about us that isn't 
read or inscribed; the real itself is an inscription, as far as we're 
concerned.
[6:30]  Alan Dojoji: Of course here's a contradiction, language and 
dirt in tandmen or one against another
[6:30]  Alan Dojoji: Etiquette above the surface of the Victorian 
table, playing footsies down below
[6:31]  Alan Dojoji: So I model the ostensible carapace, the outer 
layers of the human and human behavior, the layers in space, 
transforming through time, morphing, dividing in both conceivable and 
inconceivable patterns.
[6:31]  Alan Dojoji: I'll repeat then type and elaborate
[6:31]  Alan Dojoji: So I model the ostensible carapace, the outer 
layers of the human and human behavior, the layers in space, 
transforming through time, morphing, dividing in both conceivable and 
inconceivable patterns.
[6:32]  Alan Dojoji: By "carapace" I mean the prims that constitute the 
avatar - what I call "sheaves" since they reference laminated things, 
bent things themselves
[6:32]  Alan Dojoji: I'm composed of sheaves. I'm a sheave-girl.
[6:32]  Alan Dojoji: If you get close enough, if you set your camera in 
me, ther's nothing there
[6:32]  Alan Dojoji: Nothing at all, empty space, and you see the 
sheaves as thin slivers from within
[6:32]  Alan Dojoji: there aren't any organs of course. So what we're 
working with here
[6:33]  Alan Dojoji: Is a kind of ORGANISM FROM OUTSIDE, which is where 
the carapace comes in.
[6:33]  Alan Dojoji: It looks, I look "real" in a sense, in a way 
related to the external world,
[6:33]  Alan Dojoji: but within there's nothing but emptiness,
[6:33]  Alan Dojoji: Once Ben Hecht was asked to describe Hollywood and 
said
[6:33]  Alan Dojoji: It's a place where you scratch away the tinsel to 
get the real tinsel underneath
[6:34]  Alan Dojoji: So here you scratch away a prim or two
[6:34]  Alan Dojoji: And things are emptied, there aren't organs, 
nothing making the thing GO from the inside-out
[6:34]  Alan Dojoji: It's topology - organisms outside the screen work 
from the inside, they're busy containing themselves
[6:34]  Alan Dojoji: which is how the auto-immune system works
[6:35]  Alan Dojoji: but within the screen (so to speak) the protocols 
are outside, they're for example
[6:35]  Alan Dojoji: here in Linden Labs, not to mention thousands of 
servers and routers worldwide
[6:35]  Alan Dojoji: that bring you this stuff on your home or other 
machines,.
[6:35]  Alan Dojoji: So when I'm modeling, I'm aware that what I'm 
doing is a kind of out-of-organic-body projection
[6:35]  Alan Dojoji: I'm from space and maybe one gender into another
[6:36]  Alan Dojoji: Although projecting smears these categories
[6:36]  Alan Dojoji: So that I'm not sure where I am half the time.
[6:36]  Alan Dojoji: All of this bears on modeling of course - which is 
what this is about -
[6:36]  Alan Dojoji: modeling the human or other organic or inorganic 
natural object or process
[6:36]  Alan Dojoji: though this modeling, I hope to better understand 
what it means to BE human, particularly in relation to all of that 
debris beneath the surface, our obscene nature itself.
[6:37]  Alan Dojoji: Sorry if this appears to jump - the topic moves 
from type to cut and paste
[6:37]  Alan Dojoji: Again -
[6:37]  Alan Dojoji: though this modeling, I hope to better understand 
what it means to BE human, particularly in relation to all of that 
debris beneath the surface, our obscene nature itself.
[6:37]  Alan Dojoji: Why obscene? Because this nature is read, 
processed differently than cool speech or conversation; this nature 
constructs readings and writings, and for that matter communication 
beyond or preceding language -
[6:38]  Alan Dojoji: In other words the "obscene" is processed 
differently than ordinary language
[6:38]  Alan Dojoji: Just as sex in netsex or SLSex or any other sex, 
even sexual communication through language and gesture in SL, is 
processed differently neurologically than "ordinary" language
[6:39]  Alan Dojoji: Stephen Pinker talks about obscenity as taking 
different pathways in the brain
[6:39]  Alan Dojoji: And producing intense reactions no matter what the 
"conscious" mind wants to do or think
[6:39]  Alan Dojoji: The first thing that appears is a negative 
emotion, fear, etc. in relation to obscenity
[6:39]  Alan Dojoji: It's a different kind of language, a SOMATIC 
language, tied differently to the body
[6:40]  Alan Dojoji: anyway this nature contructs, let's say, states of 
affairs that, in terms of organism, might be considered PRIMORDIAL, 
uncomfortable, construing presence itself, desire, an awakening in the 
world, fear, dis/ease - anything before the world shuts down in 
relation to language, to the processing of language.
[6:40]  Alan Dojoji: anyway this nature contructs, let's say, states of 
affairs that, in terms of organism, might be considered PRIMORDIAL, 
uncomfortable, construing presence itself, desire, an awakening in the 
world, fear, dis/ease - anything before the world shuts down in 
relation to language, to the processing of language.
[6:40]  Alan Dojoji: (again)
[6:40]  Alan Dojoji: So that on one hand, again there's surfadce 
language, and on the other, obscneity, and for me on the third, the 
construction of avatars or modeling
[6:41]  Alan Dojoji: I wonder if one couldn't say that one is always 
modeling oneself in the real world as well?
[6:41]  Alan Dojoji: Just different tools
[6:41]  Alan Dojoji: Now to get practgical:
[6:41]  Alan Dojoji: I began by thinking about the repertoire of human 
physical behaviors, what the body can or cannot do; I used motion 
capture equipment to record and modify the behaviors. The equipment 
installs behaviors into files, much as labanotation filed away dance - 
it's a form of dance notation - much as film records movement.
[6:42]  Alan Dojoji: If you want to see one of the bvh files that 
controls my avatar
[6:42]  Alan Dojoji: Go to the browser screen youshould have up
[6:42]  Alan Dojoji: And open up - under MOCAP (for motion capture) 
materials
[6:42]  Alan Dojoji: the file out2.bvh
[6:43]  Alan Dojoji: This files indicates a LOT about motion and the 
way it's recorded here
[6:43]  Alan Dojoji: You have a root - the HIP - which is where the 
action is grounded.
[6:43]  Alan Dojoji: Everything moves out from the hip.
[6:43]  Alan Dojoji: I can disappear underground like this
[6:43]  Alan Dojoji: because I've still got the hip root, as far as 
Second Life is concerned,
[6:44]  Alan Dojoji: above ground
[6:44]  Alan Dojoji: So after that, there are all the body nodes which 
are set at an origin
[6:44]  Alan Dojoji: In other words, one begins with a root and a body 
posture, which forms the basis for the movement
[6:44]  Alan Dojoji: If you can scroll down on thefile you'll then see 
tens of thousands of numbers
[6:45]  Alan Dojoji: These represent the movements proper - what occurs 
from the original body stance
[6:45]  Alan Dojoji: You might also relate all of this to tantra or to 
roots in sutras and tantras -
[6:45]  Alan Dojoji: a kind of originary stance which is as empty as 
anything else
[6:46]  Alan Dojoji: If you now can open, say, anitaberberr.mp4 also in 
MOCAP -
[6:46]  Alan Dojoji: You'll see a "dance" between a real-life dancer, 
Maud Liardon, with the choreography of Foofwa d'Imobilite
[6:46]  Alan Dojoji: and there are two other dancers, who are virtual
[6:46]  Alan Dojoji: And pasted in
[6:46]  Alan Dojoji: And who are controlled by one of the bvh files I 
use
[6:47]  Alan Dojoji: This video was shown here in Odyssey in Second 
Life by the way.
[6:47]  Alan Dojoji: If you have any qustions about opening the file, 
please ask!
[6:47]  Alan Dojoji: If an image appears and there's no movement, 
double-click on the image and that should start it
[6:47]  Alan Dojoji: You don't need to see the video through to the end 
- you'll get the idea fast
[6:49]  Alan Dojoji: Anyway, if you open veda.mp4
[6:49]  Alan Dojoji: You'll see another kind of mapping of a bvh file
[6:50]  Alan Dojoji: This one maps the nodes of the body into 3d space 
using Blender
[6:50]  Alan Dojoji: a free 3d modeling program (I think check out 
blender.org)
[6:50]  Alan Dojoji: and here the nodes from motion capture are tied to 
objects like spheres and cones
[6:51]  Alan Dojoji: If you can close that down and upen up 
stripped.mov you'll see more abstract shapes modeled with thebvh files
[6:52]  Alan Dojoji: Finally if you open up bulb1.mp4 you'll see the 
same file modeled by what are called "metaballs" which attract each 
other, join together - the model here is viewed FROM WITHIN, and unlike 
the sheavemodeling of sheave-girl , me here in Second Life, there are 
joints and connecting skins
[6:52]  Alan Dojoji: within the blender model. It's a different kind of 
structure altogether
[6:53]  Alan Dojoji: Ok, now the bvh files themselves, beyond their 
internal structure -
[6:53]  Alan Dojoji: how are they used?
[6:53]  Alan Dojoji: So these files, which contained behaviors, were 
then used to reconstruct such behaviors with mannequins, avatars, in 
two different kinds of spaces - ones that were completely recorded, 
like film itself, and ones that were live and in real time - so that a 
viewer might walk about an avatar behaving in a particular way, in a 
particular live space.
[6:53]  Alan Dojoji: Again,
[6:53]  Alan Dojoji: So these files, which contained behaviors, were 
then used to reconstruct such behaviors with mannequins, avatars, in 
two different kinds of spaces - ones that were completely recorded, 
like film itself, and ones that were live and in real time - so that a 
viewer might walk about an avatar behaving in a particular way, in a 
particular live space.
[6:54]  Alan Dojoji: In other words, some stuff is prerecorded, some is 
liveperformance
[6:56]  Alan Dojoji: The sensors are connected to motion capture 
equipment
[6:56]  Alan Dojoji: Which in this case is attached to the body itself 
- there are 18 sensors
[6:56]  Alan Dojoji: so that a neck sensor for example wouldconnect to 
the neck, etc.
[6:56]  Alan Dojoji: The mapping is one-to-one
[6:56]  Alan Dojoji: Leg to leg, etc.
[6:56]  Alan Dojoji: What I've worked with is'breaking' the mapping down
[6:57]  Alan Dojoji: So that the sensors might be randomly distributed 
- yes - on the body
[6:57]  Alan Dojoji: or inverted on the body
[6:57]  Alan Dojoji: or thrown in a heap on the floor
[6:57]  Alan Dojoji: or placed in a star pattern
[6:57]  Alan Dojoji: or dstributed among more than one body
[6:57]  Alan Dojoji: so that you get:
[6:57]  Alan Dojoji: But more than that - the behaviors themselves were 
INCONCEIVABLY CODED, that is, created in such a way as to presence an 
impossible body - which then becomes a distorted body, a body 
transformed by the pressue, for example, of war, of torture, of 
incandescent sexuality - an impossible body -
[6:58]  Alan Dojoji: The body is "inconceivable" because it's moving in 
ways a "real" organic body can't - except perhaps under torture.
[6:58]  Alan Dojoji: or ecstatic modeling of one sort or another, or 
hallucinatory modeling etc
[6:58]  Alan Dojoji: For me what happened, the real obscenity of Abu 
Gharayb - which for a lot of us in the US was a kind of shattering -
[6:59]  Alan Dojoji: is this distortion, this abject torture, which 
threw our own national behavior in our faces
[6:59]  Alan Dojoji: I want to explore this further in SL where at 
least for the moment it's safe to do so...
[6:59]  Alan Dojoji: Anyway to continue -
[6:59]  Alan Dojoji: But a body that, being impossible, also represents 
our desires in the world, desires which, if they could, would take 
apart a real body, dissolve it in the throes of passion.
[7:00]  Alan Dojoji: - which roughly says the same thing...
[7:00]  Alan Dojoji: Again, on the technique -
[7:00]  Alan Dojoji: The techniques are surgical, cutting and suturing 
- separating and bringing together. The operations occur first in real 
life; when a participant wears a motion capture harnass, a number of 
sensors are aligned with her body parts - left leg sensor on the left 
leg, neck sensor on the neck, and so forth.
[7:00]  Alan Dojoji: We rearrange these sensors, splitting them among a 
number of people, reorienting them; the body maps become distorted, 
impossible.
[7:01]  Alan Dojoji: We ask the participants to move. We record the 
impossible movements of a single body.
[7:01]  Alan Dojoji: The recording is in the form of a file which is 
fed into one of three applications: a 3-D modeling application, where 
abstract forms are mapped onto the recording, resulting in an 'abstract 
performance' or 'performer' - a mannequin modeling application, where 
human forms are mapped onto the recording, resulting in considerable 
distortion -
[7:01]  Alan Dojoji: And a 'live' virtual space, where the behavior 
recordings are used in live avatar performance. I'll demonstrate these 
in turn. I'll also demonstrate various ways and results of scanning the 
body itself.
[7:02]  Alan Dojoji: Ok, so this is what all of this is about, at least 
for me -
[7:02]  Alan Dojoji: relating thinking and consciousness to formal 
systems
[7:02]  Alan Dojoji: and using formal systems for modeling organisms
[7:02]  Alan Dojoji: particularly the human body
[7:03]  Alan Dojoji: in a way hopefuly that can tell us something about 
the world.
[7:03]  Alan Dojoji: Here is another example - if you go to scan 
materials
[7:03]  Alan Dojoji: (lower left), open up gunscan2.mp4
[7:03]  Alan Dojoji: This is a scanned toy gun which is 'deconstructed' 
in two ways
[7:03]  Alan Dojoji: - first by moving the gun during the scan
[7:03]  Alan Dojoji: and second by reworking the suturing program - the 
program that combines still images tomake the 3d image -
[7:04]  Alan Dojoji: in different ways - in other words, stitching the 
gun together awkwardly
[7:05]  Alan Dojoji: This scanned version is highly compressed which 
makes the image a little rough but you get the idea I hope
[7:05]  Alan Dojoji: If you look at the largescanner jpgs in the same 
area
[7:06]  Alan Dojoji: Click on 05 - this is Azure Carter moving slowly 
while being scanned with a laser ordinarily used for buildings
[7:06]  Alan Dojoji: Her body breaks down into sheaves, but the chair 
and table in the foreground are "clear" because they're stationayr
[7:07]  Alan Dojoji: So this is another area to work within - the use 
of laser scanners for deconstructing the way the world appears to us.
[7:07]  Alan Dojoji: Please, if you can, open, in the same quadrant, 
ruler.mov
[7:07]  Alan Dojoji: This is a plastic ruler, also deconstructed, 
highly enlarged
[7:08]  Alan Dojoji: If you notice, there are "ridges" visible which 
seem to repeat - serrated edges
[7:08]  Alan Dojoji: These represent the indentations, markings, on the 
ruler itself
[7:08]  Alan Dojoji: I'm using this sort of thing to look at the way we 
observe and count things in the real world
[7:09]  Alan Dojoji: How do we decide what quantity is, what an object 
is, for that matter?
[7:09]  Alan Dojoji: You can't count sheep in Sumer unless you have 
some idea of counting, markers, sheep, things, and even data-storage
[7:09]  Alan Dojoji: - a way to remember the count as it goes along.
[7:09]  Alan Dojoji: So I'm thinking about this, working with these 
visual images as a way of understanding this as well.
[7:10]  Alan Dojoji: A couple of other things, and then I'll turn over 
to Sandy after answering questions; I'll also be back.
[7:10]  Alan Dojoji: Please open, under Second Life materials, the 
vector1.jpg and then look at the vector2.jpg
[7:11]  Alan Dojoji: With these, I'm trying to find some way to 
represent sexuality, abjection , a sense of discomfort
[7:11]  Alan Dojoji: with the images themselves -
[7:11]  Alan Dojoji: This is done with both texture mapping from 
photographs
[7:12]  Alan Dojoji: and intensifying, over-saturating, the color so 
that it looks as if the skin is bursting out
[7:12]  Alan Dojoji: I've also worked with issues of disease this way, 
to see how much 'emotional debris/material' can occur with what are 
after all only avatars, abstracted mathematical objects
[7:13]  Alan Dojoji: A second area of importance for all of this is the 
edge of the protocols etc. - what happens when things are pushed to the 
limits.
[7:13]  Alan Dojoji: A simple example of this - please look at 
corner.mov under Second Life materials
[7:14]  Alan Dojoji: Here movement is occurring at the edge of the game 
space of Second Life
[7:14]  Alan Dojoji: This was done with Sandy and myself
[7:15]  Alan Dojoji: I'm trying to escape Second Life, go off the edge 
of the gamesapce
[7:15]  Alan Dojoji: but I keep getting returned asymptotically to the 
space itself
[7:15]  Alan Dojoji: This goes on and on and one
[7:15]  Alan Dojoji: on and on and on
[7:16]  Alan Dojoji: So this is another area of exploration - what 
happens at the limits of geographies/gamespaces, etc.? What can we 
learn from this , particularly in relation to what we consider the 
normative social in these spaces?
[7:16]  Alan Dojoji: Clearly this is more'lunar' than anything else.
[7:16]  Alan Dojoji: For a final example for the moment, pleaes open 
control.mp4 just above - this is a recording of a performance Sandy and 
I did
[7:17]  Alan Dojoji: and what's of interest is not only the interaction 
which is occurring at the edge of the game space etc.
[7:17]  Alan Dojoji: But also Sandy's covering the screen with text, a 
kind of obliteration of communication by communication itself
[7:18]  Alan Dojoji: Before I turn this over to Sandy, are there any 
questions? [why are you dissecting]
[7:20]  Alan Dojoji: Because we take so much for granted, I think, 
about our bodies
[7:20]  Alan Dojoji: And this taking-for-granted breaks down in 
obscenity, death, torture, sexuality, tantra, etc.
[7:20]  Alan Dojoji: In other words, our lived-body is in a sense empty
[7:21]  Alan Dojoji: (this relates to Nagarjuna buddhism btw)
[7:21]  Alan Dojoji: And at the same time is mind, is emptied universe,
[7:21]  Alan Dojoji: And at least within the world of computation, 
computers, digital and analog modeling,
[7:21]  Alan Dojoji: This gives me a gateway to all of this - 
deconstruction as opening, not taking apart -
[7:22]  Alan Dojoji: into something that, at least for me, couldn't be 
described linguistically
[7:22]  Alan Dojoji: "language fails here" or some such -
[7:23]  Wave Looming: What about the corner sample you showed? the fact 
the 'abstracted entity' was constantly turned back to the virtual world?
[7:23]  Alan Dojoji: Yes - the virtual world wouldn't let go. One 
reason I love gaz' work so much is that it breaks through 
the conventions of second life
[7:24]  Alan Dojoji: That it's almost always work at the limits
[7:24]  Alan Dojoji: And I think from the limits, the boundaries, 
that's the place to look back in and see what's going on!
[7:24]  Alan Dojoji: singing about delusion (if you have the speaker 
on) from a text I wrote
[7:24]  You: - voice in what remains is azure carter
[7:25]  You: unravelling of form as the video goes on
[7:25]  Alan Dojoji: Any other quetions?
[7:25]  Alan Dojoji: Yes!
[7:25]  You: the avatar unravels from within
[7:25]  Morris Camel: what do you think of the possibility of a birth 
taking place in second life? if the "emptiness" of an avatar could 
spring forth the life of another avatar from within (given that they 
are virtual and digitally recreatable)
[7:25]  Alan Dojoji: That's interesting - the birth is always occurring 
in a sense, since the avatar's always being redrawn, not only on your 
screen, but also by the servers at Linden Labs
[7:26]  You: - this would go to the naming in SL as well.
[7:26]  Alan Dojoji: But if you mean a birth of an independent 
organism, that occurs whenever we create an avatar, I think
[7:26]  Alan Dojoji: It's interesting, in thetext-based ancestor of 
Second Life,
[7:26]  You: Note: you must have a name and that is fixed fixed, can't 
change it.
[7:26]  Alan Dojoji: the MOO, to create something you'd type
[7:26]  Alan Dojoji: @create $thing called "sheave-girl"
[7:26]  Alan Dojoji: and you'd get back
[7:27]  Alan Dojoji: You own sheave-girl with number #5748892
[7:27]  Alan Dojoji: for example - some such
[7:27]  Alan Dojoji: Which means that youv'e created an object or a 
space in the data-base
[7:27]  Alan Dojoji: and given it a name, "sheave-girl" - and the 
server has given it a
[7:27]  Alan Dojoji: number, an identification number, which it uses 
internally, and which you can also access directly
[7:28]  Alan Dojoji: You can see all the uneasy implications here.
[7:28]  Alan Dojoji: In SL, objects are also given number/letter 
addresses, but I don't know enough about the entire structure of the 
software
[7:28]  Morris Camel: like creating a physical space on the hard disk 
within the SL server as well
[7:28]  Alan Dojoji: - in other words, what sort of distributed 
hierarchy is used - to say much about it.
[7:28]  Alan Dojoji: So our creations here (not necessarily on the MOO 
which is open-souarce)
[7:29]  Alan Dojoji: are really surface-creations, server-blips...
[7:29]  You: but the distinction between creating an avatar vs. an 
object is interesting. can't exactly build an avatar the same way -
[7:29]  You: prims on up -
[7:29]  You: different matter and entities.
[7:29]  Alan Dojoji: How so?
[7:29]  You: well, you can change shape but you must have a shape
[7:30]  Alan Dojoji: That's true; on another level, in both you have 
parameters, objects that can be manipulated given a certain vocabuary.
[7:30]  You: agreed
[7:30]  Alan Dojoji: If you build a rock in a MOO, there are only 
certain things you can do to it, just as with an avatar
[7:30]  Alan Dojoji: but the avatar appears and is infinitely richer!
[7:31]  You: can't be here without an avatar, also
[7:31]  Alan Dojoji: We can't.
[7:31]  You: more questions? I can offer brief remarks otherwise?
[7:31]  Alan Dojoji: Linden Labs employees might be able to. I think 
they definitely could be here without an avatar
[7:31]  Alan Dojoji: Just as a wizard in a MOO can be entirely 
invisible, bodiless.
[7:31]  You: yes, that's true, so different for them.
[7:32]  Alan Dojoji: Any other qustions?
[7:32]  You: Some of my comments are just glossing Alans arguments as 
well  and mostly what Ill say is quite simple, part of my making 
sense of the philosophical questions Alan raises through the art you 
see here
[7:32]  You: You can interrupt me too --
[7:32]  You: Theorization of avatars  look at any discussion of 
avatars in critical theory, art theory, etc., Ars Electronica, 
Leonardo, etc. - makes mention of their (Hindu) origin as the 
incarnation of a god, but loses the fact that the avatar is always an 
intentional incarnation, and moreover that the god can only be 
incarnated as intention.
[7:33]  Alan Dojoji: Can you repeat these? Thanks
[7:33]  You: Theorization of avatars  look at any discussion of 
avatars in critical theory, art theory, etc., Ars Electronica, 
Leonardo, etc. - makes mention of their (Hindu) origin as the 
incarnation of a god, but loses the fact that the avatar is always an 
intentional incarnation, and moreover that the god can only be 
incarnated as intention.
[7:33]  You: So, I see Alans work here as dealing with intentionality 
through avatars. Ill call this a passion of/for avatars.
[7:34]  You: I think of a kind of humanism in SL - exactly tied to the 
emphasis on avatars as appearance the requirements around naming.
[7:34]  You: I am interested here in the implications for performance 
in SL. One the one hand, for the masquerade of an audience and 
performer, on the other hand, implications for performance in terms of 
the pasting of views involved.
[7:35]  You: By humanism, I think of the welcoming remarks when you 
start in SL. "We hope you'll have a richly rewarding experience, filled 
with creativity, self expression and fun," goes the welcome to second 
life.
[7:35]  You: I like all these terms: "we," "you," "richly rewarding 
experience," "creativity," self expression," "fun." Codes with 
addresses, signals with sources.
[7:36]  You: The big six social codes in SL of tolerance, harassment, 
assault, disclosure, indency, disturbing the peace redress and address 
code / semantics of appearnace. The address and source of avatar may be 
deep or shallow, but they are personal and proper.
[7:37]  You: OK. There are six social codes that Linden requires we 
adhere to in SL. They are: tolerance, harassment, assault, disclosure, 
indency, disturbing the peace (i.e. not distrubing the peace etc.)
[7:37]  You: All these social codes are about behaviors and proper 
presenations.
[7:37]  You: Similarly, Enormous work is expended building exact 
replicas of real structures and real bodies. Universities, companies, 
military units, and so on replicate their real estate here.
[7:38]  You: Here I'm identifying a drive towards fidelity to first 
life in second life.
[7:38]  You: Another version of this argument insists on marking the 
differentiations and deviations from first life. So, identify the 
masquerade and pull aside the curtain. Please remember this is second 
life! (All this goes to what we take for granted  as Alan wrote of a 
bit ago)
[7:39]  You: So, I'm noting these background assumptions of the world, 
to think about in relation Alan's work and the philosophy he's presented
[7:40]  Sca Shilova: weird thing i find is that in even in SL (as in 
RL) the boundary lays at what each individual perceives as, assault for 
example, so that you will find that even here women wont report rape 
abuse, even though it's just clicking a button...
[7:40]  You: One approach to the materials Alan and I work on is a 
question of reading in relation to the body of the other, and the 
interference in reading by technical protocols of the software, 
platform, etc.
[7:40]  Alan Dojoji: assault is just as real here in one sense, as in 
real life - people get damaged..........
[7:41]  You: well, it seems to me we (not us here but in general) don't 
have a good logic i.e. way of talking about this distinction
[7:42]  You: My remarks underline the life here as both 
representationally life first life and ontologically distinct.
[7:42]  Alan Dojoji: Which is also true I think of just about any 
social issue at all, "intellectual propertly," etc. - Yes!
[7:42]  You: My remarks underline the life here as both 
representationally like first life and ontologically distinct. I mean 
this in a simple way: we see things, through various representational 
techniques, that are like first life; we know at other levels  through 
reflection, and so on  that this is virtual. It seems seamless, at 
least at the level of signs, so land is clearly signifying land, bodies 
signifying bodies, and so on; yet discontinuous in its coded prim-ness.
[7:42]  Alan Dojoji: please again?
[7:43]  You: Well, I'm reiterating: we have a mixed zone. I mean this 
in a simple way: we see things, through various representational 
techniques, that are like first life
[7:43]  You: we know at other levels  through reflection, and so on  
that this is virtual.
[7:43]  You: It seems seamless, at least at the level of signs, so land 
is clearly signifying land, bodies signifying bodies, and so on; yet 
discontinuous in its coded prim-ness.
[7:44]  You: So, the world of SL, the life-world here is constituted 
through this mixture or medial state; and its not like this in first 
life, where the self-evidence of appearance is part of the world.
[7:44]  You: Of course, immediately there are problems with this 
proposal, as there are no end of first life exceptions, i.e. first life 
has its unstability as well and well
[7:44]  You: e.g. dreams, ecstasies, artwork, and so on; I would not 
argue against this shading of SL into FL, as inhabitation of the real 
by the virtual. Im just interested here in the difference in SL.
[7:44]  You: - I think this is where Alan'
[7:45]  You: oops, Alan's point about "intellectual property" or any 
social concept comes in
[7:45]  You: So, I suggest that the work Alan and I present here 
projects the unstability of the world through the avatar, or smears it 
across the avatar.
[7:45]  You: - a movie like planetearth.mov (see it on the SL materials 
list) is about - for me - the unstable "worlding" here
[7:47]  Alan Dojoji: For me, planetearth also brings in other issues, 
dealing with radio and radiowaves and the organization of the physical 
world -
[7:47]  Alan Dojoji: we're interpenetrated in RL (RL? FL?) by 
radiations in a way that's almost uncanny -
[7:47]  You: Aren't these related? This interpenetration is what I mean 
by worlding?
[7:48]  You: vs. a clean world that is suggested by the views of the 
interface
[7:48]  You: views: I mean the camera views, the remediation of the 
third person cinematic deigesis, etc.
[7:48]  Alan Dojoji: I don't think so? I meant it literally - 
radiations/dusts that create dis/ease, cancer, etc. in the real world - 
there's no equivalent I know of in SL, but I may be misunderstanding you
[7:49]  You: I would argue yes, that the dis/eased or dis/comforted 
body we working with here is equivalent in signifcant ways to those 
bodies in RL
[7:50]  Alan Dojoji: I'd think otherwise, since the FL body has a 
limit, that is, death, that connects to pollutions, overpopulations, FL 
violence;
[7:50]  You: vs. again, the suggestion of a clean body that 
(paradoxically) formed through the hypermediation of viewpoints.
[7:50]  Alan Dojoji: you can rebuild, resurface in SL, but not in RL
[7:50]  Alan Dojoji: What do you mean by "hypermediation"?
[7:51]  You: Hypermediation: its a term commonly used for interfaces 
where there are multiple views (e.g. bolter and grusin's theory)
[7:51]  You: the multiple views work together to suggest a single 
viewer or controller
[7:52]  Alan Dojoji: I understand, but in this context? I wonder if 
"viewpoint" can even be used in relation to cancer in FL? Perhaps 
cancer is even characterized by an absence of viewpoint... In SL in a 
sense all we have is viewpoint
[7:52]  You: - Yes, that's what I'm saying.
[7:52]  You: Well, to continue.
[7:53]  You: I want to call this, problematically, a wilderness  i.e. 
where we can't comfortably speak of single view or body or location, 
where ruptured world of SL that I described above 
[7:53]  You: the divergence of meaning and being is everywhere, where 
the masquerade is nothing but this mixed or medial state (here 
refracted through performance).
[7:53]  You: (The avatars' wandering in control.mov or corner.move, 
wandering in a corner is part of this wilderness: finding it 
everywhere, not only at the edges.)
[7:53]  You: 'Wilderness' of avatars also invokes the nonhuman and 
animal. I think here of a distinction between human and technical 
machine that maps onto the human animal distinction.
[7:54]  You: Without simply accepting these distinctions, I would say 
they need to be worked through productively. I think these are places 
where the humanist notion of consciousness and control, all over 'here' 
as it were, is broken down by a notion of wandering and following, of 
waywardness as being.
[7:54]  You: again:
[7:54]  You: I think these are places where the humanist notion of 
consciousness and control, all over 'here' as it were, is broken down 
by a notion of wandering and following, of waywardness as being.
[7:55]  You: OK. These are some quick remarks. I also want to develop a 
notion of surface that would articlate SL and FL - i.e. in the kind of 
questions raised by Alan in response above -
[7:56]  Alan Dojoji: I'd like to hear about surface...
[7:56]  You: by wilderness of avatars I mean the environments show in 
corner, or control
[7:56]  You: but also in hhhh.mov (take a look at this one under the SL 
materials()
[7:57]  You: OK. Given the wilderness of avatars I described earlier, 
my second proposal is to describe an ontology of surfaces
[7:58]  You: In describing the pasting of views and positing of the 
viewer here (audience), I assume that there is a reading through 
surface to an other.
[7:58]  You: (This is a version of what Alan said above: only 
viewpoints here.)
[7:58]  You: i.e. I assume a relation to this other  you are reading 
my message, watching my actions, and so on.
[7:59]  You: With the wilderness of avatars, I want to describe a field 
of performance that exceeds and destroys the boundaries of I and 
self, it can be a basic field of we or of intimacy.
[7:59]  You: Again, this is predicated on the basic 
semiological-ontological distinction of SL.
[7:59]  You: I think of this in relation to the scan materials Alan 
showed earlier or the mocap materials
[8:00]  You: see for example the largescanner images
[8:00]  sandy Taifun is Offline
[8:00]  You: here The surface is a midst (medium) or zone of visual 
appearance, fragrances, sound productions
[8:01]  You: (I see these thinking of surfaces as not borders or 
barriers to the interior )
[8:02]  You: I see a similar process in the other mocap materials - the 
bub movies as well.
[8:02]  You: (that you looked at earlier, bulb1 and so on -- feel free 
to look at them again)
[8:02]  Alan Dojoji: the .avi bulb is good too
[8:03]  You: Yes, take a look at that one
[8:03]  Alan Dojoji: bulb2.avi
[8:03]  You: (note: avi may not open directly in browser)
[8:04]  You: OK. The surface as midst or zone of display is part of 
the presentation of self of a living being.
[8:05]  You: My point here, returning to the earlier discussion, is 
another approach to appearance
[8:05]  Alan Dojoji: I wonder if lobe.mov might not also be relevant 
here - a mapping that's half-"cartoon" and half "avatarish"
[8:05]  You: yes, good - take a look at lobe.mov as well.
[8:06]  You: The cartoonish forces a sense of the constructed and yet 
it's also directly from the body's interior -- all the movements.
[8:07]  You: I'd say: the cartoonish even tends towards the absurd;
[8:07]  You: absurd or the earlier discussion of abject images are ways 
of Surface opacity as manifestation (pastiness) of inwardness
[8:07]  You: i.e. thickening of representation as intensification of 
projection and manifestation
[8:08]  You: So, in all this, dealing with avatars not an image of my 
body; it is, however, part of the imaging of my body, part of the 
visual imaginary of my body.
[8:08]  You: I think, for me, the best and most amazing example is the 
scan24s.mov.
[8:09]  You: I know Alan has a lot to say - other things than I would 
about this - but
[8:09]  Alan Dojoji: Sandy, I wonder if you could bring up gnats.mov in 
this regard, since it's recorded in FL but has strong implications here?
[8:09]  You: yes, sure!
[8:09]  You: listen / look at gnats -
[8:09]  Alan Dojoji: gnats.mp4 under Human
[8:10]  Alan Dojoji: This was recorded in Salt Lake City, Utah - on the 
Jordan river - gnat swarms that behave as single vertical columns, 
meta-organisms...
[8:10]  Alan Dojoji: the surface for the gnat is most likely one of 
scent
[8:11]  Alan Dojoji: for us it's "constructed" out of a pointillist 
vocabulary so to speak
[8:11]  You: i find i tend to see forms, figures in the swarm, though 
it's nothing but pieces - for me, like the shieve-girl you spoke of 
earlier
[8:12]  Alan Dojoji: Yes! Which brings up the porosity, lack of 
surface, of our own bodies, something Hegel mentions
[8:12]  You: but the forms are, surely, tied to the air currents, 
weight of gnats, following each other - etc.
[8:13]  Alan Dojoji: Tied to, but also internally constructed; in the 
still air, the columns get thinner and thinner - which happens at the 
end of gnats,mp4. This "tying together" and scent etc relates to the 
skeining of any organism I think... (I maybe wrong here)
[8:13]  You: i agree: this would be the visual / appearance of the 
inwardness of the gnat (so to speeak): i.e. the presentation of it and 
its environment
[8:14]  Alan Dojoji: Should we look at things like frenzy.mp4 or 
jump.mp4 or hold off for the moment?
[8:14]  You: i want to see a similar presentation occuring through 
avatars
[8:14]  You: yes, frenzy first. under human materials.
[8:14]  Alan Dojoji: That's where the blender stuff comes in.
[8:14]  Alan Dojoji: Please open frenzy.mp4
[8:15]  Alan Dojoji: I work with Foofwa d'Imobilite, a Geneve- based 
dancer who has a company; I think he's one of the best dancers in the 
world at the moment
[8:15]  You: Award winning dancer...
[8:15]  You: This is not in relation to a specific avatar recording, is 
it Alan?
[8:15]  Alan Dojoji: And he takes the avatar material, SL for example, 
"returns it" to FL, and back and forth; we mutually interpenetrate 
activities this way
[8:15]  sandy Taifun is Online
[8:15]  Alan Dojoji: No - it's in relation I think both to our work on 
producing-as-fast-as-possible and avatar in general;
[8:16]  Alan Dojoji: the duetavatargrante.mov or thewall.mov are 
directly related to avatar recordings
[8:16]  You: - frenzy, not the file but the movement of foofwa, is in 
relation to his body in a way that the avatar movements are to theirs 
though
[8:16]  Alan Dojoji: please try and look at these - they may stutter...
[8:16]  Alan Dojoji: Yes -
[8:17]  You: so, tied to the question of appearance of inwardness
[8:17]  You: ok, let'
[8:17]  You: oop, at duetavatargrange.mov
[8:17]  Alan Dojoji: (Please do interrupt with questions if you have 
any)
[8:18]  Alan Dojoji: I'm watching thewall.mov now
[8:18]  You: Well, I know Alan has a great deal to say about 
duetavatargrange and thewall. Let me close my thoughts on surface -
[8:18]  Alan Dojoji: - avatar movements constricted by the very real 
wall of a grange in the Alps, Maud Liardon and Foofwa dancing
[8:18]  Alan Dojoji: Ok, sorry
[8:19]  You: and then alan can say more about these one's.
[8:19]  You: Closing: I set out an idea of surface as thickening or 
manifesting inwardness.
[8:19]  You: Add to this being-with or following surfaces,
[8:19]  You: being-with avatars as avatar touching avatar touching 
viewer as thickening and projective residue of consciousness
[8:20]  You: so, by this I mean avatars as self-announcement of being 
into sl
[8:20]  You: all this set against what i earlier (too quickly) marked 
as a "humanism" of avatars, where the task is to read back to the 
"driver" as it were
[8:21]  You: self-announcement as what happens in the "wilderness of 
avatars" I mentioned earlier
[8:21]  Alan Dojoji: Is self-announcement of being similar to rewrite? 
Can you elaborate?
[8:21]  You: - yes, continually self-announcement and production (with 
implication of work, economy) through the avatar
[8:21]  You: rewrite: an important concept developed by alan in the 
internet text
[8:22]  You: the subject writes and rewrites into existence.
[8:22]  You: i would say self-annoucenment is cognate, but i wanted to 
focus on the appearance of the avatar as opaque signal (thus 
announcement)
[8:23]  Alan Dojoji: avatar as emblem -
[8:23]  You: yes, ikon
[8:23]  You: Are there questions? Happy to answer more? Or, happy to 
turn back to duetavatargrange and here more on that
[8:23]  You: [quickly: i distinguish between sematic appearnace and 
cryptic appearance, both zoological terms for how animals appear -
[8:24]  You: but both the cryptic (camoflauge) and sematic (display) 
are part of the self-annoucement of the avatar]
[8:24]  You: But: questions?
[8:24]  You: Also: a quote from Mishima.
[8:25]  You: If the law of thought is that it should search out 
profundity, whether it extends upwards or downwards,
[8:25]  You: then it seemed excessively illogical to me that men should 
not discover depths of a kind on the surface, that vital borderline 
that endorses our separateness and our form, dividing our exterior from 
our interior.
[8:25]  You: Why should they not be attracted by the profundity of the 
surface as well.
[8:26]  Alan Dojoji: Ok, I'm a bit mixed in relation to IM here, but 
I'll type for a while.
[8:26]  Alan Dojoji: Please open duetavatargrange.mov under the 
lower-right quadrant
[8:27]  Alan Dojoji: This is again a Liardon/Foofwa performance
[8:27]  Alan Dojoji: Before I begin with this I want to mention again 
rewrite - for it's important here.
[8:27]  Alan Dojoji: Simply, embodiment in Second Life or online in 
general is INTENTIONAL
[8:27]  Alan Dojoji: In other words, one has to write to have presence, 
has to have an avatar to presence oneself
[8:28]  Alan Dojoji: And one continually writes/performs/acts in these 
spaces
[8:28]  Alan Dojoji: As a way of ascertaining, indicating existence
[8:28]  Alan Dojoji: Log off and you're gone
[8:28]  You: - alan, this differs from RL in the sense of not being 
able to log off so easily, so to speak?
[8:28]  Alan Dojoji: Even if you use a bot to keep you online in 
appearance
[8:28]  Alan Dojoji: One moment
[8:29]  Alan Dojoji: Even if you use a bot to keep you online in 
appearance, it's not responsive to someone, although someday a Turing 
test might prove different
[8:29]  Alan Dojoji: But at the moment, you're "hereness" is indicated 
by behavior, statement, etc.
[8:30]  Alan Dojoji: So embodiment is not background, the way it is in 
FL; it's not GROUND, not Primordial so to speak - it's always already a 
deliberate and intntional construct that needs renewing...
[8:30]  Alan Dojoji: Re: What you were saying, you can log off in RL, 
but this brings up all those issues of euthanasia, legislation against 
suicide, etc., which are problematized in SL...
[8:30]  Alan Dojoji: With duetavatargrange.
[8:31]  Alan Dojoji: Foofwa and Maud were working from studying the 
kinds of avatar-moement
[8:31]  Alan Dojoji: from the BVH files you see here - and using this 
movement as a choreography, bending the human back into the virtual.
[8:31]  Alan Dojoji: So for example, their contact with one another is 
problematic - as if they shojld be transparent with each other
[8:31]  Alan Dojoji: but aren't -
[8:32]  Alan Dojoji: The materiality - what Rosset calls the "idiocy" 
of the real world interferes, interrupts
[8:32]  Alan Dojoji: just like, or in a sense just like, dreams are 
interruptions, are interrupted
[8:32]  Alan Dojoji: When we work together, Foofwa & whomever and 
myself and Azure Carter,
[8:33]  Alan Dojoji: we move betwen language, sexuality, body, virtual, 
prim, construct, choreography, improvisation, projection, 
introjecdtion, etc.
[8:33]  Alan Dojoji: all of these things so that after a while it's 
almost as if we can't tell what world we're in.
[8:33]  Alan Dojoji: Please look at jump.mp4 in Human Materials for an 
example of this
[8:34]  Alan Dojoji: That's about all I have to say at this end, - 
Sandy - or questions? Please, any sort of dialog would be greatly 
appreciated!
[8:34]  You: I wanted to ask, first, back about rewrite.
[8:35]  You: The distinction between rewrite and ground, let's say, 
insists on the distinction between FL and SL.
[8:35]  Alan Dojoji: Different modes of presencing... yes
[8:35]  You: And, of course, as you note the places we consider rewrite 
in first life are limit cases: suicide, euthanasia, etc.
[8:36]  You: Still, there is a presencing in first life that seems to 
me like rewrite.
[8:36]  You: we do "show" our selves and there is an intentional aspect 
that always there...?
[8:36]  You: in part, I'm trying to pressure the difference between 
these worlds / lives
[8:37]  You: (as in earlier, you mentioned that there's real damage to 
those hurt in Second Life, and so on)
[8:38]  Alan Dojoji: For me, that's an issue of roles, Goffmann; the 
kind of presencing I'm thinking about is fundamental - someone "is" 
there or not - the codes, protocols, are upon or within that matrix. 
And presence is different in these areas. The "real damage" in SL isn't 
one of disease, death, the violence of Darfur for example - modes of 
coercion are very different and more benign in SL
[8:38]  Alan Dojoji: They're absolute in FL
[8:38]  You: - second, can you say more about Maud and Foofwa -
[8:39]  You: there was a phrasee: they should be transparent,
[8:39]  Alan Dojoji: Yes - it's as if they're following the gestural 
order, regime, of SL etc. - but can't - the obdurate, inert gets in the 
way.
[8:40]  Alan Dojoji: For me this brings up again Abu Gharayb - what are 
people thinking when they move the bodies of others into obscene 
positionings and then photoraph them?
[8:40]  You: yes!
[8:40]  Alan Dojoji: (Which is one reason I want to see Abu Gharay 
re-enacted here.)
[8:40]  You: in Second Life....
[8:40]  Alan Dojoji: Yes
[8:40]  You: I'm curious about response to that (both from those 
gathered here and in general)
[8:41]  You: In terms of following the gestural order - a good way of 
putting it, I think -
[8:41]  You: this isn't just at the level of chains of signs, but also 
they way those stick to the body -
[8:42]  Alan Dojoji: I think, under the Bush administration, this order 
has been foregrounded in a sense - I'm thinking of the beheading of 
Perl (Pearl?) and others as well.
[8:42]  You: By "order" I'm thinking of a command and also a logic or 
representation?
[8:42]  Alan Dojoji: I think this confrontation with the imminence of 
violence is a change of regime in a sense - YouTube etc. contributes to 
this, the slaugter of the world becoming transparent
[8:43]  You: and al jazeera (new network)
[8:43]  You: news network
[8:43]  Alan Dojoji: A logic or representation of a regime of commands -
[8:43]  Alan Dojoji: Yes, and not just al jazeera -
[8:44]  You: Can you discuss the effect of setting that order here?
[8:44]  Alan Dojoji: I don't really know; I think it should be 
explored..
[8:44]  Alan Dojoji: For me SL appears like a safe house, literally
[8:44]  Alan Dojoji: in that slaughter and mass animal extinctions seem 
somehow remote
[8:45]  You: i think sprites.mp4 relates?
[8:45]  You: and wolf.mov
[8:45]  Alan Dojoji: and they shojldn't be; the suffering - YES, please 
look at this?
[8:45]  You: look at sprites.mp4 under the mocap materials on the web 
page
[8:45]  Alan Dojoji: but they're not remote, they're contingent
[8:46]  You: sprites is set at a wind power generating station in West 
Virginia, USA, on a ridge above some old lead mines.
[8:47]  Alan Dojoji: And the torn-up bodies were in direct relation to 
Abu Gharayb
[8:47]  You: There's a sense, for me, of natural power and intense 
technological power.
[8:47]  You: Also, look at wolf.mov in the mocap materials.
[8:48]  Alan Dojoji: Wolf.mov was in response to 9/11 - the background 
was shot in the "bathtub," the exposed basement of the blown-apart 
towers,.
[8:49]  You: again, the avatar is destroyed? reworked? eaten? from 
within.
[8:49]  Alan Dojoji: The foreground is a wolf mannequin from the Poser 
software which is deliberately distorted by hand until the planes fall 
apart; the mouth also opens, a destroyer as well
[8:50]  Alan Dojoji: Susan Sontag, I think, wrote about the tens of 
thousands of dead birds found around the towers...
[8:50]  You: Well, please we welcome questions from all of you!!
[8:50]  Alan Dojoji: I think this is a good place to stop for dialog, 
if we can; we've done our best to present an outline of thework so far
[8:51]  Alan Dojoji: In the future I'll be embedding these 
figures/behaviors in a Cave (3d environment) , taking it out of 
thecave, back in, etc. etc.
[8:51]  Alan Dojoji: and working with Sandy and Foofwa on the results 
which are still really unknown
[8:51]  You: (thanks alan, was just going to mention that)
[8:51]  Alan Dojoji: I also want to try working with more complex 
motion capture equipment on one hand
[8:52]  Alan Dojoji: and more complex bvh files on the other so that 
larger amounts of data could be dynamically mapped onto virtual 
organisms
[8:52]  You: There's also another dimension of exploring analog waves, 
radiations, etc. through very low frequency radio, crystal radio, etc.
[8:52]  You: that seems to me to work in a counter space or dialog with 
this work
[8:52]  Alan Dojoji: But I'm probably kiding myself - this requires a 
lot of computer science I don't know at all...
[8:52]  Alan Dojoji: I depend on the kindness of strangers...
[8:52]  You: Well, questions?
[8:53]  Alan Dojoji: Just want to mention this text will be made 
available online, with all its faullts and mistypings...
[8:53]  You: Can you think of things to take from this to your own work 
- or do you know of similar work in this area?
[8:53]  You: yes, I will post it to the website and the blog
[8:53]  You: and it will be available on the intimacy site
[8:54]  Wave Looming: just a quick comment on the spirtes film
[8:54]  You: ok
[8:54]  Wave Looming: there is a real tension between what alan refers 
to as the natural and technology power
[8:55]  You: - those were my terrms (sandy) not sure if alan would 
endorse that?
[8:55]  Wave Looming: the wind seems to be generated by the power 
planet which caused the body parts floating
[8:56]  Alan Dojoji: Ah yes, I'm also thinking of the propellor vanes 
themselves cutting into bodies; this happens with birds for example, 
but here I'm thinking more of a microtome...
[8:56]  Wave Looming: it can be read in many ways - floating = 
suffering?
[8:56]  Alan Dojoji: yes
[8:57]  Wave Looming: or floating as a result of being tied together by 
the wind?
[8:57]  Alan Dojoji: maybe, re buddhism, suffering can also 
beconsidered part of the natural order of things
[8:57]  Wave Looming: perhaps, it can also been seen as a pleasure that 
can only experienced in SL
[8:58]  You: - I think of Sontag again, whom alan mentioned earlier - 
re suffering and photos
[8:58]  Alan Dojoji: I don't really see this degree of distortion as a 
pleasure; if suffering is pleasurable as in masochism, I'd think it 
would have to be implicit in real life, felt, keywords and all. the 
difficulty for me is that it's hard toget away from SL cartooning, make 
something felt as political, abject etc.
[8:59]  You: i think, also, just as earlier we said that we don't have 
a clearly articulated language for the mixture of FL & SL,
[8:59]  Wave Looming: if it's intended to be read as suffering, then, 
it makes me question more about the agency we think/believe we might 
have in SL
[9:00]  You: so too, viewers of these videos or of SL in general don't 
know how to process the content & poltical point
[9:00]  Alan Dojoji: I'm not sure the reading is that "intended" but 
certainly the sphere, reference, is
[9:01]  You: I think this question, like that of "staging" abu ghraib 
here is an important one - especially if tethered to other media 
(youtube, etc.)
[9:01]  Wave Looming: it brings back the issues relates to the limits 
in SL which also applies to the technological limits in RL
[9:02]  Alan Dojoji: What I've seen or heard about re-enactment here - 
it's art performance about art performance; I'm not sure why, when 
there are so many more urgent things to explore
[9:02]  You: - yes. Other questions?
[9:02]  Alan Dojoji: The technological limits in RL are also -vis-a-vis 
bandwidth - limits in SL. This is also related to limits of economy - 
who canafford, for example, DSL, who has access to T1 or T3 lines at 
what institutions, etc. -
[9:03]  You: yes, or simply the economy of development, programming, 
etc. definitely.

[I take the radio because there is nothing left to do; voice enters the

disgust, lassitude, detachment, decathecting, disinvestment, that renders 
objects and the world la nausee, worthless, used-up, spent. It accompanies 
the corrosion of desire; it accompanies the borderline. Defuge, undercut-
ting the digital or discrete with the uncomfortable analog-abject, the 
fissured real.]

Perhaps a way of teaching media 

(I've been filling in for a couple of film courses at Brown University, 
and this has led me to think through distributed knowledge in an 'open' 
classroom, and how that plays out. The courses were, I think, extremely 
successful. I've been partly inspired by two artist/teachers from the 
1970s-80s: David Askevold at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, 
and Lutz Presser at the Tasmanian School of Art. Neither of them taught in 
any conventional sense; both had a sense of student professionalism and 
'being' that created outstanding works and environment. So below is just 
some thinking about all of this; it's hardly original. it seems to work 
well for me and my students, most of the time. There are also times I'm a 
miserable, neurotic failure, but that's another issue, and not necess- 
arily related.)

1 In terms of authority - everyone in the class, including the teacher, on 
equal footing. I think authority comes from knowledge, not titles, formal- 
ity, etc. This is hard to do within an institution where power is the 
fundamental backdrop of the classroom, but I've done it as much as poss- 
ible.

2 Distributed knowledge among students and faculty. In many areas, partic- 
ularly those dealing with digital and popular culture, students are often 
more knowledgeable than faculty. This is especially true with software - 
students are apt to have used and hacked programs I haven't. Knowledge is 
distributed and students and faculty work together, empower each other. 
The classroom becomes a holarchic space of production, exploration, and 
critique. I have to recognize that what I know, in many areas, is already 
outdated.

3 No assignments except for technical in the beginning which may or may 
not be completed. Students find their own paths through the class, subject 
matter, and production. Students who are confused or aren't motivated 
should be helped along, of course; the more collaborative the class is, 
the more these students might be carried forward within a general atmos- 
phere of communality. This area might be the most difficult - how to work 
with unmotivated or reticent students - but I've found there are almost 
always workarounds; at times, students might even ask for assignments or 
help with content and/or media.

4 Learning equally from students as students from you. This goes along 
with distributed knowledge; there's also distributed learning. If I'm not 
learning, I'm not teaching well; if the class seems closed in this 
respect, I'm doing something wrong.

5 Students/faculty = equal participants. Again, this plays out against the 
backdrop of fundamental power, but that power should be deconstructed as 
much as possible. Along with this - try to interest as many other faculty 
as possible in the course (I've not been so successful here), and encour- 
age students to bring outsiders in as well. Obviously there are limits on 
this, but in general it works well.

6 Students treated as artists/writers/filmmakers to to the fullest extent 
possible. The most successful classes I've seen are those in which stu- 
dents are considered as producers in their own right. If I begin with the 
idea that what a student is doing isn't 'student work,' more often than 
not, I've found that students rise to the occasion.

7 "Professional" advice. Discussing art-making after university - how to 
present, distribute, survive, both online and offline. Encouraging stu- 
dents to submit work to suitable venues, organize screenings or exhibi- 
tions, etc. I've also encouraged students to do their own media/art 
history as much as possible; what's current is what is/will become the 
student's environment, once she leaves university. I've tended to share my 
own work/experiences in class to a limited extent, trying to keep students 
from stylistic influence.

8 Students are free to work on whatever, including sliding into other 
genres, media. Since the work is student-determined, ostensible class 
content might not be the most suitable for a particular project. Instead 
of dropping the project, perhaps change it, or change media.

(I feel I'm not presenting this stuff as well as I should be; others have 
done a far better job of it. The main points are both a kind of withdrawal 
on the part of the teacher, and an emphasis on distributed learning and 
production on the part of the class as a whole. This doesn't work for 
everyone in all situations - but when it does, the results are amazing in 
so many ways.)

[Why is this here, other than it works pedagogically? Because it argues 
for dispersion, de-centering on a practical level, perhaps teacher and 
students as emanents.]

defuge6

The stem of the 6 leans forward, ready to topple.
The stem of the 6 is retained by the entire and complete
calculus of capital.
The calculus of capital is thick, exhausted, is always
exhausted, is always singular, singularity, always 
the point and paste of the thing.
The calculus is in opposition to glue holding disparate
parts together _as such._
The calculus of capital knows only the unary divide.
And the unary addition and the unary increment
and substitution. And the unary substitution.
In my weary world the head bobs uselessly.
It looks in the thick of things for clock and radio.
It pulls the sheets up and pulls the sheets down.
It wraps and unwraps the cadaver of the body.
Beware the thud of 6 and thud of capital.
What is ready to topple sooner or later topples,
sooner or later revives into disparate parts.
(What is ready to topple has the consistency of glue.)

second life third life

begin by setting out directions, these are the five healthy directions, 
the middle direction is one of exhaustion and ecstasy, then in the 
direction opposite the middle direction set out the last direction, which 
is one of wounding and suffering. if the middle direction is reception, 
the last direction is penetration, if the last direction is reception, the 
middle direction is penetration. set the house in order from the middle 
direction outward, these are the spokes which narrow to the point of 
intersection between the middle direction and last direction. now forget 
the four directions, concentrate on the spokes, the point, the middle and 
the last direction. then concentrate on the spokes, forget the point, the 
middle and the last direction, the spokes come close to the point, forever 
close to the point, but the point is absent, emptiness, emptiness radiates 
outward between the spokes. now forget the spokes, emptiness radiates 
among the ghosts of them, the spokes are hungry ghosts, they gnaw at 
emptiness, they are wounded, they are defeated, they disappear. now think 
of emptiness, think of nothing else, think of nothing. now you have laid 
out the house and the world and the word, but you are in ignorance, you do 
not know house or world or word, if you think house or world or word you 
must begin again, laying out the five directions and so forth. now you 
have come to an end and you are ready to begin, you have come to the 
beginning, and you are ready to end. now continue.

you must imagine now yourself and house and world and word annihilated, 
you must imagine annihilation of annihilation. you must imagine almost all 
pleasure, among taste of delight and touch of exaltation, and among scent 
of numinous being and sight of untold beauty and hearing of harmonious 
sounds. now you must imagine another being joined to yourself and house 
and world and word, you must imagine penetration reception and reception 
penetration, you must imagine fullness and overflowing of delight. now you 
will find you are creating and you are making sheave-woman and sheave-man, 
you are sheave-woman and sheave-man, you have sheave-sight-and-sound, you 
have sheave-touch-and-scent, you have sheave-taste-and-mind, you have 
sheave-passion and sheave-ecstasy. now you will walk and remember, you 
will remember everything, and you will speak and hear, see and taste, you 
will forbid nothing, you will not be forbidden, you will rise above and 
sink below, you will be among the direction of wounded and suffering. now 
you will do this for a long time, for aeons.

now you will embrace emptiness, you are making sheave-other, you are 
making sheave-emptiness, you are making wrath, are making creation, are 
making annihilation. now you are making annihilation, now you are among 
them, beneath them, above them, now you are beyond them. now you are no 
longer imagining, you are no longer thinking among them, you are no longer 
thinking, no longer sheave, no longer thought, now you are annihilation, 
now you are making nothing, now you are annihilation, now you destroy 
house and world and word, now you are destroyed, now you are annihilation, 
you are free, you are emptiness, you are annihilation, you are emptiness, 
now you are free.


Derivation of "Bug," telegraphy code, etc.


"Bug" has been traced vis-a-vis computer folklore to early programming/ 
hardware/software/etc. as far back as the 1950s I believe. But recently 
I've come across a much earlier source. In The Telegraph Instructor, 4th 
and revised edition, 1908, G.M. Dodge gives a list of telegraph terms.

"Bug-in-the-wire -- A slang phrase frequently used when a wire is in 
trouble."

This relates to "buggy," "he's bugged," "stop bugging me," and so forth; 
what's interesting is the noun related to communications technology. In 
relation to computers, this might be a case of convergent evolution, but 
it's more likely to have moved through telegraphy - telephony - radio - 
and so forth, into the habitus of information theory and cybernetics.

Another early term relates to the origins of "ham" in "ham radio" - 
although the exact source of this remains unknown:

"'Ham' or 'Plug' -- A telegraph operator, who is not proficient."

[A number of phrases we take for granted are older than they appear. For 
example, "so long"; from A. Wallace, Popular Sayings Dissected, 1895: "So 
long! a leave-taking, a piece of colonial terseness is equivalent to 'au 
revoir, saluons!' of which latter word it may be a direct corruption, or 
again of 'salaam,' a bow, or 'salem,' 'peace be with you.' The phrase may 
be paraphrased into 'Goodbye, so long as we do not meet.'"]

On another related topic, early Morse code was somewhat different; there 
were all sorts of variations - Navy Codes, European Codes, Morse American 
codes, etc. The same book gives for example, "The Morse code of signals as 
applied to the telegraph is used exclusively in the United States." The 
code as given has three dash-lengths; for example,

t is - 
but 
l is -- 
and 
0 is ---- 
In addition, 
c is .. . 
that is, some letters have small breaks within them; while 
i is ..
o is . . 
and 
y is .. .. 
and Further, there are some longer strings; ending parentheses
) is .....  .. ..
and
capitalized letters are indicated by .. . .-..
- so it goes. (Oddly this has been difficult to type, since I wanted to 
eliminate meta/diacritical marks which might have been taken as part of 
the code itself!)

The actual telegraph (semantic) code on top of the Morse results in 
messages such as

Wr r ty gg r 9
or
Es r ty cn
and addresses/headers can read as obscurely as
Hr tru pink No 38 VO HW "HX" ck 12 collect N P R

The code, like international signals codes, is heuristic, ideographic, and 
was simply memorized by the telegraph operator. It was just as complicated 
for railroad telegraphy, where the difference between 19 and 31 - both 
meaning "train order" - was complex. 

Note that this is triple-coding - Morse to telegraphic code to ordinary 
language, and that, while natural language is fond of redundancy (re: 
Shannon/Weaver), telegraphy is dominated by economic considerations. 
Thus word counts, and what constitutes a word, are critical. For example:

Van Dorne - 1 word
Queen Anne County - 3 words
44.12 - 5 words
No. 185 22nd St - 8 words
North Carolina - 1 word
10 000 000 - 8 words
and so forth.

The telegraph operator also had to understand railroad Engine Steam 
Whistle Signals; here are a few (o - short sound and --- long sound):

o Stop. Apply breaks.
--- --- Release Breaks.
--- o o o Flagman go back and protect rear of train.
--- --- --- --- Flagman return from west or south.
--- --- --- --- --- Flagman return from east or north.
--- --- --- When running, train parted; to be repeated until answered.
o o Answer to any signal not otherwise provided for.
--- --- o o Approaching public crossings at grade.
o o o o Call for signals.

Air whistles are different, as are torpedo signals, light signals, 
semaphore, etc.

Service Message Code:

N S N - No such number.
G B A - Give better address.
G S A - Give some address.
DFS - Disregard former service.
92 - Deliver.
Deld (or) 92d - Delivered.

There is also Phillips Press Code - an example:

elegy for Boojum, our companion cat, we are all poor,


'i can't do elegy' -
this is a poor and sleepless poem -
when something's at the limit there's nothing more to say -
for a moment i might have reversed the process
but heard nothing more than wailing or sounds like an animal -
nothing of crying, just tattered sound -
nothing of warning, fear, existence, trepidation -
nothing can be said on either side of death -
neither this one nor that one -
neither this nor the other -
death is an other -
(eighteen years, and death is an other) -
death is everywhere, death is not around -
(eighteen years, and death is everywhere,
death is poor, death is not around) -
always already other can't speak can't hear can't see -
double needles, of sedative, of anesthetic overdose -
doubled needles -
who are these people & their kindness -
(eighteen years and the kindness of strangers) -
i'm done with it, the other's never done with it -
always the last trip last day last night
last meal last touch last scent last sound -
(eighteen years and the last day and night,
last touch and meal, last scent and sound) -
in and out of the thick of it -
the thick of it never changed -
it stayed dry, viscous, substance and fissure -
it's uncomfortable, stains, sticks to everything -
lives on in us, exchanged, drops to the ground -
crawls out, walks to the sea, drops to the ground -
i can't drop to the ground, i drop to the ground -
there's an elegy on, everyone's there -
she says i think we're at the beginning of speech -
she says she's very sad and wants to go hone -
she stood dry, unattended -
(eighteen years and dry and unattended,
accompanied and unaccompanied, who can go 
into and out of the world) -
the fire went out, into the world --
today someone counted elements,
earth, fire, water, wind, air, heat, dearth, 
wood, & metal -
(eighteen years and the counting of elements) -
how was the air, the air was cold, bitter,
the wind harsh, we turned the carrier against 
the wind, dearth of it all, harboring a flame
until the last, dying in our arms, the metal table,
off to a far wood of hunting -
the world is filled with secret coordinates -
impermanence of the metallic -
she says she thought of the limit -
in a small heaven somewhere -
& now we are silent in the night, existence is silent -
existence crawls, we heard her cries, the catheter
carefully inserted elsewhere in the building -
we held her heat against us, we exchanged heat -
the tablets - prayer wheel spinning above a slow flame -
we couldn't bear to empty her water, clean
her bowl of food, now despair reigns, & in our arms
nothing happened, everything seized --
'this is a poor and sleepless poem' -
without goodbyes, with ill-knowledge,
with infinite regret, with the world undone -
(eighteen years and the world undone) -
ah ah ah ah
ah ah ah ah
ah ah ah ah
ah ah ah ah



intolerable.


always, I thought, intolerable.
I cried intolerable, it was a sound.
it is intolerable to decide for or against death.
if I leave a house, I may or may not return.
things may not return exactly, but most often they may return.
death is intolerable. death does not return.
I may decide, I will harbor this animal, this person, this cause.
caring, giving, are implicated; sympathy, and perhaps empathy.
this is a tending, not a shepherding or stewardship.
or a mutual tending, shepherding, stewardship.
this is a continuity, this is constant.
the decision for death is instantaneous at the moment of death.
it is intolerable to make these decisions.
a decision for life may be revoked.
then, again, at the moment of death, implying already decided.
or that action or performative accompanying.
I saw the sedative administered, needle and catheter.
even then, I could have stayed that other, harboring the moment.
I went through with it into eternal darkness.
surely Boojum did not suffer, just as surely she wanted to live.
I made a decision, for her, and against her living.
for in the theater of steel, she resisted everything and strongly.
she defended herself, lovingly as usual, her claws withdrawn,
her mind full, commodious, insistent.
she defended herself, death was the last thing on her mind.
and we held her and tried to comfort her, she growled slowly,
and then lay down and then not at all.
it is intolerable to make these decisions!
one should kill oneself after such decisions! I am a coward!
one should not make these decisions!
for one universe has ended and why should another continue?
WHY?



re\play


this replay of abjection
is the playing-out of infection
beneath the aegis of dejection
somewhat tantric rejection
resulting from subjection
swallowed from projection
beyond a form's bijection
operated through surjection

useless wireless trope
against a brainless dope
darkling in a mope
there's nothing left of hope
impossible to cope
headless figures grope
tangled in a rope
crawling down a slope
they're given too much scope
elephants in a bathtub one says to the other please pass the soap
the other says no soap radio kind of introjection



success at last, just for a moment

it has been a difficult few days in the virtual environments laboratory. 
we moved most of the motion capture equipment to 109 to use, but couldn't 
locate the bvh computer (which receives signals from an old 486 used with 
proprietary hardware). the explanations written by the interns were miss- 
ing as well. we knew the bvh machine had to be around. we found an old 
dell and gary put windows 2000 on that, getting the key from another mach- 
ine. we put bvh software on the old dell, but the signals from the 486, 
which, it turned out, had to go through a router since we had no crossover 
connectors, were crashing it. so we were back to square one. i figured if 
i could locate a photo of the old bvh computer we'd used years ago, we 
might be able to use it to match with one of the bunches of similar units 
in 302c. i looked through archive after archive, until i located it; the 
image was slightly blurred, but the layout of the masking tape label (un- 
readable in the image) on top of the machine allowed us to narrow poss- , 
ible candidates to two. we found we couldn't get into either without pass- 
words. i discovered a scrap of paper in a corner of the room, 302c, with a 
password on it; it worked. so now we set them both up and one of them, 
which had been used as a projector connection to a virtual wall, was it. 
we brought the machine down to 109 and it almost ran; at least the soft- 
ware didn't crash. i found changing the antenna parameters for the motion 
capture and moving from ascii to binary and from tcp to udp did the trick. 
gary set up the 5100 port and addresses and we produced slomo.bvh as he 
moved the sensors slowly around; i wanted to duplicate the speed of the 
5-7 frames per second output of the 486, instead of working high-speed as 
i usually do. we brought the bvh file to poser on a compaq laptop which 
for some reason is now permanently misconfigured but usable; the result is 
which i quite quite like; if you ignore the hand fluttering, the movement 
is closer to what we need to work with at the moment. as far as the 
hand-fluttering is concerned, we're going to internally turn off the hand 
sensors by modifying the capture program, written in c, but with clear 
documentation; even a non-programmer like myself can get into it a bit. 
now to slow things down further so the inconceivable happens at the speed 
of amoeba-learning; in addition, to transform avatar into deity-emanent, 
following, introjecting yamantaka or one or another manifestation, moving 
mind and sheave-body into other realms far beyond 486, 2000, 109, 302c, 
5-7, until what ever may appear in the future brought quickly back to 
earth.



Railroad Club


Images from open house, Morgantown model railroad club, embodying cuts 
from one scale to another, from human to true world, from mind to emanent. 
Who would call this the postmodern? One might locate something else here: 
not the cut but the suture, not disparity but deep memory; the locales 
represented, real and imaginary, conjure the West Virginia landscape of 
the 1950s, in the memory of many of the club members. What better than a 
photograph than a reconstruction in which everything is punctum, intended?

The photographs are of the text, of this text; they're weaker without it, 
they go elsewhere, I'm pulling them back in. I'm pulling them back in to 
indicate multiculturalisms and emphases on locale and habitus tend both 
suture and division (these people, these others) in favor of _listening_ 
and its phenomenology.

But listening is skew-orthogonal, again, to the _style_ of the images, 
based on any number of photographers and trajectories.

Now what do I see when I do not know what I see? Certainly aspects and 
entities are present within the true world filtered through the history of 
photography and photographers who have no responsibility for me.

Where are the passengers in this life? Where are the passengers in the 
life of the other?

You can already feel the economy of the land, extractive industries, pov- 
erty, environmental pollution, mountain-topping, strip-mining, deep-min-
ing, feed stores, small towns in the hollows, grey dust, what's worn is 
worn, what's not is brought into play through deep memory's suture which 
even bends, transfigures the landscape, someday we'll all rise to the 
surface.

I will live forever
I will live forever
I will live forever
As a hungry ghost
As a hungry ghost
I will live forever

I don't remember the exact name of the railroad club or the members. Some- 
one named Mike, I believe, made the larger mine model. I came in as a 
tourist finding nameless things. the models were both outstanding, depres- 
sing to an outsider. The images appeared as images, imaginary, with what- 
ever context I might bring from the outside; the social depth was absent. 
I turned to the jump-cut.

The jump-cut was of the visual, that disparity of mind and scale. Railroad 
switching systems were fundamental to the development of the Internet. 
Evidence of electronic skein was everywhere. Jump-cut sutured into dream- 
scape, dream-screen, displacement/condensation semiotics. What is of truth 
or tending towards the indexical in the images applies as well to the vis- 
ual in general, compounding of memory, suture, cut, surface. Whatever one 
sees is surface, surface-only; x-rays report on deeper surfaces, 
translucent or transparent to invisible light.

The photographs bother me, as if theory needed image-propping beyond the 
diagrammatic. But what can the image hold, if not an arrangement that 
might be constituted as evidence? If a diagram is indexical or symbolic, 
the photograph resides elsewhere; evidence stands for nothing and hardly 
represents itself, nor is it pointing towards something across ontological 
or epistemological lines. On this level the photograph simply reports as 
Bazin might have it, on what-is, or rather the what-is and thetic con- 
strues within the dialog of image production. In any case, the postmodern 
is left behind, or rather, is relegated to analyses of socio-economic 
phenomena where the theory works wonders; think of postmodern geography, 
Harvey or Roja for example.

What would postmodern geography make of mountain-topping? And then its 
representation which makes the wrecked landscape somehow graspable, 
something to walk around, replant with meadow or pasture?

I think of tantra, mandala, Jefferey Hopkins' introduction to the Kala- 
chakra Tantra (Kalachakra Tantra, Rite of Initiation, Dali Lama, 1999). 
Hopkins walks/writes the body of the reader through the mandala ("Notice 
the entryway at the eastern door, wider than the doorway, with a three 
storied portico above the entranceway. Each of the stories of the portico 
above the entryway has four pillars across the front, thereby creating 
three room-like alcoves on each story. In each of these eight alcoves are 
goddesses of offering; the middle alcove in the first story on the eastern 
side has a black wheel of doctrine with a buck and doe to the right and 
left." And so forth.) Now think of the Morgantown railroad club images in 
the same or different shimmer, think not of the imminent/immanent identi- 
fication of entities within them, but of paths through or around or by 
virtue of these entities, which themselves are processes (one doesn't live 
forever, the tracks are constantly changing). Is there a meditation here, 
emission or spew that is sourceless except for (in spite of) the corners 
or frame of the image? Can one imagine a habitus, inhabitation? Is there a 
seeing that moves through memory near and far without the supplication of 
the signifier? This is what literally remains to be seen, and brings the 
essay to its clothes.


Anti-Crystal


Crystal radio apparatus set up in Morgantown, with main inductor coil of 
the honeycomb type. A diode and air-capacitor were used; these three 
elements constituted the original radio, with the exception of the diode. 
The antenna was coupled with a variometer and second air-capacitor, both 
old. The antenna was 90 feet long-wire wrapped around two sides of a house 
in a hollow. Reception on 1300 from a local station was so dominant that I 
attempted at all costs to avoid it, bringing hum and background into play, 
with mixed results. The whole was fed into a sound editing program for 
further modification. I attempted a democratization of the airwaves, 
allowing the power grid and other interferences their say. The result is
sculpted to be of sufficient interest in itself. This sculpting, like 
other aesthetic decisions, interfered with the original intent, but I do 
believe such interference constitutes the history of much recent art, if 
not certain schools of somewhat machinic poetics. For what is present must 
be presence, if presented, there must be a force behind it driving the 
efflorescence, there must be intention behind that force or a reading of 
that intention, there must be a consciousness behind that reading, there 
must be mind behind that consciousness, there must be confluence beyond 
that. What is here is confluence, for your listening and your listening 
pleasure.

'It is time some of you vain babies, who have a 'body beautiful' complex 
about your dancing, realize that an expressive body is more beautiful than 
an unexpressive one. But no, you fight distorting your body - even the 
least bit. If you won't, you won't, but your dancing will be shallow, and 
as empty as the baby stare some of you are cultivating.' (Horst)

'I'm not asking you to tie yourself up like a pretzel or grovel on the 
floor, but there must be some distortion if you are portraying even a 
slight case of mental malajudstment - a little inferiority or martyr 
complex.' (Horst)

'You can't drag an analyst's couch out on the stage and tell us about it. 
You have to express the mental with your body, so you distort the move- 
ment somewhat to externalize.' (Horst)

'All of them died on my red lips
In my hands
In my sexlessness
Which possesses all sexes
I am as pale as moonsilver.' (Anita Berber trans. Gordon)

'In every experience of every objective 'This' by every experiencer the 
female differentiating function is necessary, but so too is the male seed 
of unity, which supplies 'Being' from the side of the subject, the unitary 
consciousness of self from the side of the experiencer.' (Rawson)

'Why are so many boys and girls not erect? Look in almost any school and 
you see that many of the pupils, whether sitting or standing, are never 
straight. Heads are forward; shoulders double over a little, sometimes a 
good deal; chests incline to droop, and grow flat. Fine, full chests, and 
an easy, graceful carriage, are rare.

As the pupils get older, these faults, instead of going away, grow worse.

Can this be helped? Is there any way to make a crooked boy or girl 
straight? Take a slim, angular boy, for instance, whose father is round- 
shoulded and flat-chested--and perhaps his mother, too: can he become 
straight, like a soldier?' (Blaikie)

'The same [entity] does not arise from [itself], and how can it arise from 
another? Neither does it arise from both [itself and another], and what 
exists without any cause?' (Candrakirti, trans. Huntington)

'The singularity of specular reflections is demonstrated by the fact that 
if one tries to apply to them the schema of a communicational process mamy 
puzzling conclusions arise: source and addressee coincide (at least in 
cases where a human being looks at him or herself in the mirror), receiver 
and transmitter coincide; expression and content coincide since the 
content of the reflected image is just the image of a body, not the body 
itself; as a matter of fact the referent of a mirror image is pure visual 
matter.' (Eco)

The Beautiful Throbbed Emanentation


The following is a culmination of certain directions associated with mo- 
tion capture - in particular, operating too near and too far from the 
receiving antenna, with mixed sensors. In both positions, the configur- 
ation generates furious behavior as clusters of sensors shoot to ragged 
infinities and back again. Heads may detach and the cartoon integrity 
returns as such. The reading, however, is different, as is the jectivity; 
the reading is external, jectivity internal. The reading searches for 
coherency: which body belongs with which organ? Jectivity follows organ, 
head, and limb paths, identification with approaching, consummating, 
withdrawing, churning. This is Brownian motion, but radically integral. 

So what is being modeled? For one thing, slow-simple movement, carefully 
seducing, caressing, antenna and sensor alike. For another, electronic 
jitters which threaten to break apart the world. 

(This is some of the most advanced video/mocap work I've done; I'm always
amazed that both beauty and wonder can come out of such poverty. It's the
machines which are talking, which are rubbing against one another, which
parlay communication into visionary ekstasis. I must learn, I continue to
learn, how to listen, how to see, what is proffered, what is not within my
powers of conjuration. Magic is magic because it always come from the
Other. I have lost expectation.)

Violence, abjection, arousal, caress, tumescence, thickening, cutting of 
the sheaves. Sheave-figures which I am sure will soon be independent of 
our desire or construct.

Abjection is the most difficult. How to dis/comfort and fetishize, hold 
and release simultaneously. These emanants do this naturally, as Azure 
Carter, original model, follows suit.


Abjection is the most difficult, less so as the camera moves in, cuts
through sheaves. For the viewer there is the level of the subterranean bvh
code in dialog with the exigencies of Poser models, but there are also
levels of organs and affect, and it is the breasts and hands, high-speed
maternal display, that provide tremulous scaffolding:


graphic used interface


constrained and smeared temporally and spatially
swallowing time, swallowing space
body used and wounded, sutured
sound smeared fore and aft

both say everywhere everywhere
both say everywhere where are you i'm hurting
both say everywhere where are you i'm saved



outline of emanent research (current work at wvu, written 1/18/08)


(note while the notions of 'code,' 'coding,' 'decoding,' codework, 
underlie almost everything below, they're not explicit - nor are the 
actions of reading and writing. the actions can be considered emergent 
phenomena, and the notions as primitives in the sense of members of a set, 
etc. again, the analog and digital phenomenologies are implicit as well, 
as are the (related) concepts of abjection and purification. the analyses 
of these comes out through praxis, attention to detail, thinking through 
mandalic structuring until the scaffolding leads, not to silence, but to 
tending. this should be clearer as the work progresses.

i should note that the following is both a constitution of my usual/cur- 
rent directions and most likely too ambitious. the trajectories circulate 
around formal systems and their psychoanalytic/psychological receptivi- 
ties, around emanents and 'true worlds,' around edge phenomena which turn 
towards the uncanny and abject, around languages, bodies, sexualities, 
communalities, and inhabitations. i have increasingly worked through 
buddhist philosophies, the analogic and digital at the limits, notions of 
'dis/eased' philosophies, deathing and uneasy worlds. now that i have a 
clear time to think through these things, the outline below is useful as a 
guide; for that matter, it's a guide to the past few years of the 'inter- 
net text' as well.)

I. motion capture: this conjures up external behavioral characteristics 
translated into internal processes (penetration, scale, displacement, 
torsion, according to various geometries). think of mocap behaviors 
operating within a constrained field with strange attractors / catas- 
trophic jumps. continue to develop mocap with new multi-valent sensors
and software rewrites:

1. turning nodes on and off
2. combining nodes
3. mathesis such that node1 = f(node{n not = 1}), or such that 
   node1 = recursively f(node1)
4. multivalent sensors such that sensor(x) = sensor[{n}]

what are the emergent images here?

what is the possibility of constructing bvh files with additional nodes 
determined mathematically from the hardware set? or mathematically from 
extraneous data?

what is the possibility of other organic models (i.e. than human or
animal forms)?

IA. data remappings

entry of bvh files into blender:
1. modeled onto abstracted forms
2. modeled onto parent/child forms
3. modeled onto metaball forms

blender file outputs:

1. entry into cave environment: static or dynamic
2. video output
3. what is the possibility of gaming output here? (moving around emanent 
   environment)
3. second life output: static or dynamic/interactive
   
IB. interiors

1. standardized interiors: sheave-skin, sheave-organism
2. constructed 'model' interiors: solid, transparent, penetrable, 
   impenetrable
3. abject fluxed interiors: how should these be constructed?

IC. interior narratologies

1. abject/purified narratologies and emanent interactions 
2. abjected/purified contents of dis/ease, dis/order, ecstasy, ekstasis, 
   catatonia, defuge, death/immobility, sexuality, speech/murmured/
   whispered/cried/screamed, body formed/deformed 
3. tantric/middleway theoretics

ID. choreographic mocap (see above)

1. additional issues of jump/leap, exhaustion, tether
2. video/photographic output as well as bvh

II. scan

phenomenology of scanning, causality across scanned lines

IIA. small scanner

1. head/speech phenomena dissected
2. schizophrenias and beam-splitters
3. reflections from coils, air condensers
4. static tantric buddha image: sutured, stitched-displaced, node
   combinations and splits
5. wounds, scars, lips, genitals, ears

output into .obj files into blender/cave
output into video/still image files

within blender: solve the issue of disappearance/transparency

IIIB. large scanner

1. interior scans: rooms with bodies, reflections, dance-studio,
   scan-choreographies
2. exterior scans at bretz coke ovens, persona rapid transit (in motion), 
   soccer fields
3. mobilized body scans in inert environments: reading 2d -> 3d, nature of 
   the inference.
3. environmental scans with mobilized and peripheral bodies
5. narratologies of such bodies: violence, chase, jump/fall, etc.
6. choreographic narratologies

III. access grid (open source internet 2 group messaging/environment)

1. distant interaction with emanents
2. readings of the corporate / corporate bodies: photographs/video
3. theory and discussion, levinas, leder, lingis, etc. at the distance
   of telecommunications

IV. cave and second life

1. performance and documentation
2. working/running within emanent interiors
3. and so forth

V. goals of the above:

1. what does it mean to be in-carnated within the real/virtual/
   true world?
2. what are the edge-phenomena/plastic and static limits of the body?
3. of the geopolitical body? of the political-economic body?
   performance: abu-gharayb modeling in sl
   performance: abu-gharayb modeling in choreography
4. what are the signifiers of bodily arousal/violence/meditation?
   how are these constituted within the real/virtual?
5. readings: what does it mean to read the real body? the virtual body?
6. what are the ontologies and epistemologies involved here? 
   ontological status of the so-called virtual -
   schrodinger's cat paradox and collapse of the wave function as model
   for simultaneous analogic/digital readings -
   seeing through microscopy (tunnel, scanning, optical, etc.):
   are ontology and epistemology equivalent at the limit?
   (are analogic and digital equivalent at a parallel limit?)

VI. medical model

1. internals and externals, static/dynamic. remnants of the visible 
   human project, gendering of the visual/internal 
2. comfort, dis/comfort, ease, dis/ease, hysteria and abjection/fluid-
   ity (laycock's 1840 essay on hysteria, kristeva, chasseguet-smirgel)
3. dis/ease, hysteria, and so forth of emanents
   distorted emanent behavior and body image (gaz)
   distorted surface textures and behavior-collisions (sondheim)
   distorted worlding, 'bringing one out of the true world' (etc.)

   reception, phenomenology of body coupling with antenna 
2. scanner - social, continuous socio-political landscape description.
3. sw - anomalous signals
4. long-wave - anomalous signals
5. crystal - the receptivity of inert materials, primordial radio and
   primordial radio culture
6. phenomenology of the antenna/field: materiality of the world as
   electromagnetic channeling

VIII. emanents within fieldings, choreographies, edge/boundary phenomena

VIIIA. praxis of edge/boundary phenomena

1. analogic and worn emanent boundaries
2. edge / boundary phenomena - physics and psychophysics of the game-
   world edge in second life
3. phenomena of the sheave-skin and sheave-skin internals
4. phenomena of medical models in relation to edge/boundaries

VIIIB. praxis of edge/boundary phenomena with hardware/software 

1. edge phenomena in literature, codework, mathesis of the text
   (cramer's and reith's programs)
2. edge phenomena within the motion capture software, poser, blender,
   calculations for example of sin(tan x) as tan x nears the
   asymptote
3. generalization of edge phenomena into the dialectic between tacit
   knowledge (polyani) and error (winograd/flores)

VIIIC. live choreographies: 

1. foofwa and soccer (edge phenomena, dancesport, etc.)
2. foofwa with crystal radio, vlf radio, etc. in large field
3. sexuality of ballet (nude ballet, classical or genre figures),
   gendering of roles, ballet as emanation

   of the machine

IX. world-constructions

1. what constitutes worlds? constructing?
   world of the text, inhabitation/dwelling/building (heidegger,
   dufrenne)
2. what constitutes the true world? worlding?
   'true world' in which lines/angles are 'trued' (affine geometry),
   'true world' in the sense of 'trued' phenomenologies within which
   virtual, real, and ikonic are blurred and interpenetrating, somewhat
   equivalent, and within which traditional epistemologies of symbol/
   sign/signifier/signified/index/ikon etc. break down (kalachakra
   tantra, jeffrey hopkins)
3. 'reading' underlying (substructural, configuration files, guides)
   organization of mocap/scan through surface phenomena
   (and the relationship of this reading to waddington's epigenetic
   landscapes)
4. who is world? communality, consensuality?
   the problem of other minds and the problem of consensual other minds
   (group hallucinations, vijnanavada, dwarf sitings, ufos, etc.)

X. outputs:

1. video and film (in practice, usual issues of apparatus/spectator)
2. digital and silver photography (digital/analogic and analogic/digi-
   tal divides - potential well on one hand, grain on the other)
3. series of short papers/descriptions
4. series of performances (individual and collaborative)
   morgantown and elsewhere across real geographies
   anywhere across virtual geographies
5. formal presentations at wvu (spring and perhaps fall)
6. formal presentations elsewhere



Writing and Wryting

[Written for an online class at DMU]

I write daily and when I'm not writing, I'm thinking about writing or 
writing in another medium; the world is a world of inscriptions. At one 
point I believed there were signs, that the world was inhabited by 
signifiers which might or might not have referents; now, after looking 
repeatedly at tantra and the casting-off of whatever was found and 
impeded, I think signifiers might be nothing except residues of a kind of 
frisson, the world rubbing up against itself. Whatever codes there are, 
and however these codes are manipulated -


they're not the only story, or rather, they _are_ the story but that's 
nothing - what's going on in the world isn't story at all. We tend to make 
scripts of things around us - that's how we get along. For example, 
there's the restaurant script (and this example of course isn't mine) - I 
enter a restaurant I've never been in before, but I know exactly what to 
do; there's a restaurant script and subscripts; we don't make it up 
immediately - that would be far too costly - but rely on constructing, 
memory, reconstructing, and so forth, and there we are, eating together. 
And it's eating together, because scripts, like the world, are consensual 
and build community.

Somebody said something like aye, there's the rub of it - and that's it, 
precisely; the world rubs one, _worlding_ is a form of rubbing - which 
makes virtual worlds such as Second Life all the more perplexed, where 
rubbing and any physics has to be _intended_ by someone, a programmer, or 
nothing would happen at all. Still, in second life, one might have bodies 
or rather one might _inscribe_ bodies with writing, and this body writing 
I call _wryting_ and it occurs in the real world as well. For example,


where avatars conform and display to one another, and all these behaviors 
are automated from written files called bvh files, which give an indica- 
tion of how virtual worlds are in fact a kind of writing. Here is part of 
a bvh which produced what you've seen in throbbed:

HIERARCHY

This gives the initial positions of the body; later, there are tens of 
thousands of numbers that give the node movements from these positions.
Do note that this is an ascii, a text file, and not a binary, not an 
executable; the file is executed by a program that uses it as data. In 
this sense, the virtual world is always inscribed, digital, just as the 
real physical world is not written, but _is,_ and is analog, and tends to 
wear out. Nothing wears out in the digital world, and while avatars - what 
I call emanents - need electricity to run, they don't need food. Still, 
given that, I think that for a conscious mind, a mind used to dreaming, to 
projections and introjections, there are no real differences between the 
virtual and the real, and there's dreaming, proverbs, tales, stories, 
poetry, poetics, hallucinations, hypnagogic imagery, meditations, and the 
like to show that. 

And even though the real physical world isn't written, it's full of 
writing and our bodies themselves are always already written, inscribed - 
full of tattoos, scars, burns, abrasions, wrinkles, salves, perfumes, 
calluses, and so forth. I think it's from these things, particularly from 
scars, wounds, abrasions, scrapes, etc., that language descends - that 
language is first and foremost a reading of the history of the body, that 
the body, the physical body, carries its own primordial memory upon it. 
That's important, since it's this memory, these scarrings, that bind us to 
the earth, to the world, the analogic. The digital is constructed from 
that with a bit of a help from the corporate, from political economy - the 
digital rides and infuses poitical economy in fact. So there are digital 
standards for sampling, for encoding and decoding and checksums and so 
forth, and these guarantee that a parsing of the world in one part of it 
can be a parsing of the world in another. Think of the digital as an 
extrusion, and think, even, of writing as _always_ digital or at least 
always discrete, one symbol differentiated from another, from the other, 
as all of them together generate meaning within organism and conscious- 
ness, generate culture.

An aside here to the effect that _culture is all the way down,_ that any 
organism has culture, has learning, has the symbolic, has the digital (in 
the sense that catastrophe theory prescribes and describes certain sudden 
shifts in behavior or states which might as well be digital, that is _on 
and off switches_ operating within potential wells, that is a level above 
noise which allows them to function. Recent experiences in fact demon- 
strate amoebic memory, even within this one-celled animal without neurons 
or nervous system. It's important to think throug this, to see the world 
as not only processings but also culturings - if you do that, a very 
different kind of world emerges. 

So where does codework or digital writing come into play here? One might 
begin back with culturing - that the world is replete with poetics, that 
it makes real, concrete, sense to speak or think of the poetics of the 
real - that this isn't just metaphoric. And then one might proceed fur- 
ther and realize, within the analogic the digital resides - that the 
analog harbors splits and leaps, as the collapse of the wave equation or 
annihilation of virtual particles shows. And within the digital, there's 
the analog as well - the potential well upon which the digital rides, 
literally, let there be no mistake about it. 

So one might ride the digital as well, perceive the digital as an extru- 
sion from the analogic, or a residue, or a system of signs which for the 
most part are produced by humans, according to human conventions and 
protocols, for example, the tcp/ip structure or protocol suite of the 
Internet - and if not this protocol suite, another or an other. Then one 
writes here, in this medium, in this temporarily electronic medium (for 
there might be other sorts of transmission in the future, who knows? or 
other sorts now for that matter, literally for that matter). And within 
the digital, in which bits bite bits, every pixel, every character, every 
moment of the digital is independently accessible, and every moment is 
deeply ruptured, disconnected, from every other. This is why the digital 
is inherently untruthful; there's no truth within it, since manipulation 
is complete and replete within every file, every domain, every protocol, 
every instantiation in fact. There are no lies, either, and if there are 
narratologies, these reside in sememes embedded or encoded within the 
digital, interpreted by organism, often human. In creating in such an 
environment, one plays god, or at least deity (in the tantric sense); one 
constructs out of nothing, and if I write the phrase, as On Kawara might, 
"I am still alive," these letters are, at a very fundamental and concrete 
level, completely independent; I could just as well write "lkurj llisihg" 
or anything else, literally, again, for that matter, and for the sorts and 
sortings of that matter. 

Well, I can write anything, I can say anything. And some of what I write 
just lies there, and some is performative, in the sense that, if I type

k3% date
Sat Jan 19 01:13:23 EST 2008

at the k3% prompt, the date is returned - the word is not just a word, but 
an action, a process, an operation inherent in the reading and writing of 
it within an operating system. Now if I type

k7% lkjsfug
ksh: lkjsfug: not found

as you can see, it's still performing, but the operating system is looking 
for a meaning or decoding and can't find any or rather finds a kind of 
null-decoding which is based on absence. So that electronic writing, with- 
in a terminal window is always a performance; it's never static. And it's 
not only a performance, but also a communalit, since there are others who 
may well be present, even though invisible, uncounted, and unaccountable:

for example are running around on the same machine I am, and I'm aware of 
them, even though I don't know who they are. I can find out what some of 
them are doing:

for example, but I'm not informed as to the semantics involved, only the 
protocols, the surface syntactics.

So one might see codework as a mix of all of this, a kind of dirty or 
abject combination, a kind of rupturing, of surface and depth, one 
producing another or an other, a kind of drawing-out of the fecundity of 
the world and its structure, its poetics. This combination or drawing-out 
reflects the real unclarity of what I call the true world, which is the 
real and virtual world interpenetrated, intermingled, diffused, effused, 
as they are for us, no matter where we think we are, in first life or 
Second Life or what I call third sex, which is online sex, as if there 
were a first or second, which there aren't. 

Beyond this, I'm not sure what codework is, even though I've invented or 
discovered the term. Here is a program Florian Cramer wrote for me, called 
eliminate.pl (it's in perl):

#!/usr/local/bin/perl5

while (<STDIN>) {
        @words = split /[\s]+/, $_;
        @spaces = split /[\S]+/, $_;
	for ($x=0; $x <= $#words; $x++) {
                $word_count{$words[$x]}++;
if ($word_count{$words[$x]} == 1) {print $words[$x],$spaces[$x+1]}
                }
        }

This is based on the Thousand Character Essay, written in Chinese around 
fifteen hundred years ago - an essay in which each character is different 
from every other; each character, in a sense, is primordial, individuated 
- an extreme nominalism. Although I don't know Chinese, I worked with a 
friend laboriously translating it. Anyway, I wanted to duplicate this in 
English - use a program in which each instance of a word appears only 
once, that is, at its first (and only) appearance. Within this, the fol- 
lowing are still distinguished: "word" "Word" "Word," "word-" and so forth 
since these have different ascii renderings. Here is part of this very 
essay rendered with the program:

my writing

I write daily and when I'm not writing, thinking about or in another 
medium; the world is a of inscriptions. At one point believed there were 
signs, that was inhabited by signifiers which might have referents; now, 
after looking repeatedly at tantra casting-off whatever found impeded, 
think be nothing except residues kind frisson, rubbing up against itself. 
Whatever codes are, however these are manipulated - they're only story, 
rather, they _are_ story but that's what's going on isn't all. We tend to 
make scripts things around us how we get along. For example, there's 
restaurant script (and this example course mine) enter I've never been 
before, know exactly what do; subscripts; don't it immediately would far 
too costly rely constructing, memory, reconstructing, so forth, eating 
together. And it's together, because scripts, like world, consensual build 
community.

== Now this is at the beginning of the text, and clear, but see what 
happens towards the end:

$word_count{$words[$x]}++;($word_count{$words[$x]} == 1) {print
$words[$x],$spaces[$x+1]} }Thousand Character Essay, Chinese fifteen
hundred years ago essay each character other; primordial, individuated
extreme nominalism. Although Chinese, worked friend laboriously
translating Anyway, wanted duplicate English use instance appears once,
only) appearance. Within fol- lowing distinguished: "word" "Word" "Word,"
"word-" forth ascii renderings. rendered program:

== Here, towards the end, the condensation is extreme. One might think of 
this in terms of the biblical book of Genesis - and one of the first 
things I did was to render Genesis with the program, which resulted, 
again, in a kind of _Vac,_ word-creation, creation-word of a primordial 
sort. I think of this as codework, since, reading it, it becomes clear 
quickly - what is happening, what the structure is - even if the code 
itself isn't present except as a disturbance upon another text, an other.
This becomes clearer, perhaps, when the program is applied to itself:

#!/usr/local/bin/perl5
while (<STDIN>) {
 @words = split /[\s]+/,
$_;@spaces /[\S]+/,
for ($x=0; $x <= $#words; $x++)
$word_count{$words[$x]}++;if ($word_count{$words[$x]} == 1) {print
$words[$x],$spaces[$x+1]}}

== Now I don't think of this as a 'better' example of codework than the 
first example, even though code is evident here; it's just another sub- 
ject for the performative maw. 

A point about interactivity: Every writing, wryting, upon reading or 
sensing, scenting, is always already interactive; the inscriptive is never 
_linear,_ no matter the appearance of lines. Memory, remembrance, is at 
work, scanning moves backwards and forwards, moves in chunks, and even 
syntax tends to jump about, leap. There is of course an active interactiv- 
ity, in which the reader/scenter is required to _do_ something concrete, 
within a repertoire or potential series of actions; hypertext is perhaps 
the simplest example. I've not been so interested in that, and my lack of 
interest has to do with worlds and the false appearance of choice; I'd 
rather have the running of inscription and meaning go on about without 
interruption, as the world goes on about one, even though one seems to 
have choice within it. This stems to some extent from my interest in film; 
I've never been carried so far in a hypertextual situation as I am when 
embedded in the cinematic other which is also the self, selving. The world 
is complex and I attempt to deal with that complexity and its perturba- 
tions, attempt to deal with the surface codes of the world. This isn't a 
manifesto on my part, and in fact, I've produced interactive work as well, 
particularly in simple Visual Basic, but I'd rather the interactivity 
occur elsewhere, within consciousness.

Here are some links. First, to the most recent series of texts:

pm.txt - here you'll find all sorts of things, from a report on an 
airline's first attempts at wireless en route to the derivation of 'bug' 
(as in software or computer bug), to the kinds of code early telegraph 
operators used, to... a google scraping piece on 'bush fucks' to... an 
elimination piece featuring my Facebook superwall. These texts are 
'thicker' than many others, and they're stressed - we were mov- ing 
temporarily to West Virginia, and our companion cat of 18 years had to be 
put down, which was one of the most traumatic events of my life. At this 
point, pm.txt is somewhat diaristic, although most of it isn't.

These are part of the Internet Text, which I've been writing since 1994, a 
continuous meditation on the above and other subjects. If you look at the 
earlier texts, for example:

http://www.alansondheim.org/net1.txt - you'll find a clearer form of expo- 
sition than much of the later work. Since this is from 1994, the Net is 
very different, mostly what I call 'darknet,' referncing lower ascii and 
terminal windows as standard, instead of the current multi-mediacy. Almost 
from the beginning, I wrote through avatars, other characters, who really 
weren't other at all (see my file-in-progress, 

http://www.alansondheim.org/pn.txt - for an account of the research I'm 
doing in this direction).

This is about it at the moment; as you can see, there are gaps, errors 
(which I'm interested in), disturbances, in the account. On another, an 
other, hand, we can proceed from here, I'm sure.

And thanks for this opportunity -

I met my Baby, out behind the Gaz-Works


You don't often think of your body unless you're thinking of your body. 
It's there and even when you think of it, you're incarnated, presenced. 
You're presenced all the time. Sign off Second Life and you're gone. 
That's the ground state, disappearance. In SL your bodies intended, 
there's nothing given but the slate. Whatever is added parallels cinema 
and the mise en scene - nothing is left to chance unless chance is 
determined, built-in. But it's the projections that fundamentally 
characterize it - introjections from SL body to organism, projections from 
organism to SL body. Think of this as jectivity, an uncanny relationship 
which escapes determination, which flirts with abjection. The SL body is a 
body that is witnessed, except for the somewhat clumsy 'mouselook' which 
places you within it; the mouselook eerily bends the landscape while the 
framework monitor remains static. There's always background going on in or 
within/without SL; jectivity operates through a normalization that behaves 
as dream-screen - for jectivity to occur, the SL/organism interface must 
appear coherent, cohering - an inhabitation or dwelling beyond building. 
Gaz breaks through this in a way that would be illicit in the world of 
organism, of course; pulled or distended limbs in the latter would be a 
form of torture or death. One might still speak of self-image and perhaps 
drugs which alter it, even the appearance of the physical scaffolding of 
the organic body, but Gaz does this with what one postulates, again as a 
kind of background radiation, as a normal state which is a state of 
absence.

All of this is too neat and I'd argue further a few things - first, that 
body and mind are always already both 'real' and 'virtual,' the computer 
monitor appearing within this almost as afterthought - and second, that 
culture, which is interlaced with intentionality, occurs all the way down 
and across - not only from amoeba to, say, bird (with destructive humans 
halfway across this continuum), but also from carbon- to silicon- based 
lifeform which would include both amoeba and computer, if not the internal 
combustion engine. I speak of spew and emissions - of signifiers which 
ride across and above the surfaces of what's really going on - the true 
world - and it's these signifiers that are subtextual operatives within 
Second Life and art- or culture- working in Second Life, which is coding, 
coded, recoding, writing, rewriting, and wryting itself constantly - 
wryting being the implicit inhering relationship of inscriptive to the 
body, bodily inscription and inscriptive body coalescing and coalesced 
from the very beginning.

Think of edges of worlds and bodies; Second Life adds two new constants: 
height (evidenced in flying) and gameworld boundaries, for example at the 
bottom of the ocean where everything is transformed, and moving forward 
out of the gamespace results in asymptotic returns to the interior. Camera 
movement can distance you from the avatar; one can move within, beneath, 
above, within her. There are at least two positions of inherent interest. 
In the first, the camera leaves the avatar altogether, in order to peer 
beneath the gamespace or elsewhere across forbidden zones, and in the 
second, the camera appears within the avatar body - a view that brings the 
sheaves/prims to the foreground, not goreground, as the avatar dissolves 
into empty space. Gaz' reach extends, appears to extend, of course it 
doesn't and can't, outside the gamespace altogether (a point in an expand- 
ing universe is still within an expanding universe) - this is an inversion 
of a caveworld, transformed into private plateau. Again the physics are 
odd, exposing the Second Life universe as non-isotropic whatsoever - as a 
construct within which worlding occurs and within/without which the true 
world operates as it does, ontologically and epistemologically, everywhere 
we are, can think of, within and without jectivity.

Now there are issues of entrapment, reminiscent of current RIAA stuff; Gaz 
insists that one's body in Second Life is not one's own, and that jectiv- 
ity in the same is only artifact, in fact mitigated by Linden Labs, at 
best. S/he's a gadfly or parasitic (in Serres' sense of cultural producer) 
about the game (as one is a man or woman 'about the town'). So one's 
behavior in the vicinity of a Gazwork, gasworks (think of Bhopal) is not 
one's own, either; the distortions and entrapments, the weighings-down, 
are not of one's making, but of one's wandering into a work such that the 
wandering becomes the catalyst or primordial state of the work.

Not always, but almost always, avatars are smaller than one's physical 
body, or appear so. And one's viewpoint is not always, but almost always, 
above and behind the avatar, slightly raised - as if one's watching a 
soccer game, which for a spectator can be senseless from a ground-based 
camera. I think this kind of miniaturization tends towards a maternal 
reading of the world, a reading within which the image on the screen forms 
a safe matrix; after all, the computer goes on and off, games and software 
are replaced or updated, and both the world and you go on. So here's this 
safe world, and jectivity or what one might call the 'jectivity-braid' - 
the braid of psychoanalytic renderings, readings and writings, introjec- 
tions and projections, dreamings and hallucinatings, all before or within 
and without the screen - this braid is taken for granted; it's the safe- 
house of the world, transforming the world and the true world into a 
habitus. As a result of peering and miniaturization among other things. 
And the ability to chat and keep or erase chat. And the ability to fly or 
teletransport, playing into Freud's condensation/displacement in the 
dreamwork. Second Life is a _pun_ in this regard - one place quickly sub- 
stituted for another, and such substitutions revolutionary or disrupting 
as one landscape disappears, another appears - perhaps throwing everything 
off but just for a (very safe) moment. It's the safety in punning that 
makes them revolutionary, and the same safety occurs in relation and 
through the braid. So again, when Gaz takes a meta-position in relation to 
this relation, when Gaz appears apparently half-in and half-out of the 
gamespace, the disruptive becomes difficult to absorb, becomes something 
that doesn't happen in the real (except perhaps with sado-masochism and 
the use of safewords which break out of one theater into another). It's a 
contradiction which can't be absorbed. And to return to one's "own" avatar 
body after Gaz' distortion, one logs out of Second Life - in other words 
out of the fundamental world, what is _being_ the fundamental world - into 
another world with its real dangers, etc. - the world of the inert or 
'idiotic' real (Rosset).

So that the space-time slice within which your body is distorted must be 
abandoned. So that one returns and in this return, like the prodigal 
daughter or sun, the body is made w/hole again, just like in the MOOs and 
MUDs and various adventure games which are the history of all these spaces 
and WOW and whatnot. (I want to mention briefly my own work here, which is 
concerned with inconceivable positionings of one's own avatar, position- 
ings within which behaviors pile on behaviors, creating 'behavior colli- 
sions' that create, for the viewer (distinct from the performer), a 
disturbing and/or dis/eased representation of the body, an abject body 
that indicates something else other the normative is occurring, something 
that can't be absorbed. With Gaz, this occurs first-person - the change is 
to _me_ and my image/imaginary; with my work, it's third-person and in a 
sense stains or transforms the mise en scene into something abject and 
unexpected.)

To conclude on a mundane note - There are two things that distinguish Gaz' 
works as well as Second Life, and are critical for contemporary theory, to 
the extent that contemporary theory is critical. First, the latter: When- 
ever people talk about an experience in Second Life, they talk as if 
they're _in the world_: "I just wandered around and didn't see much." "I 
talked to some people and a bird flew overhead and grabbed me." "I was 
teleported to the Odyssey Gallery and saw an amazing work there, well, not 
actually _saw,_ but experienced." "I kept looking for someone but all I 
found were empty spaces." And so forth. So the _experience_ of SL melds 
with experience otherwise (or the same), and this doesn't happen with 
other online experiences, except of course games and other social spaces. 
We adapt quickly to the screen, we're braided to the screen, and this 
permits the creation of artworks and environments that simply have no 
parallel elsewhere: "I entered this house and it flew away." "I turned 
myself from a forty-year-old man into a sexy twenty-year-old." "I couldn't 
get lose from the bird until I logged out and in again." "I was buried in 
paintings." "Records played by themselves." "I flew." We say these things 
as if they're everyday, as if they were always possible. "Question-marks 
were falling everywhere." Sometimes the servers are hacked or slowed up, 
but even this can be absorbed until everything grinds to a halt, and then 
one just logs out, waits, logs in again. This logging-out/logging-in has 
become an integral part of SL, in fact, just as online/offline otherwise 
is integral to being in a post-industrial world. (I do want to point out 
that this isn't, naturally, the only world - the world outside the matrix 
or braid is characterized by intense poverty, local wars, starvations, and 
so forth, and SL is powerless in relation to these; one might argue in 
fact that SL is too much of a safe haven, that it detracts from real 
praxis and real difference in the true world. And there's truth to this.)

The second, related, thing in conclusion, is Gaz' works themselves; as I 
pointed out above, the behaviors they trigger couldn't occur outside 
gamespace without bodily destruction - and some of the behaviors couldn't 
occur at all. So these behaviors, these works, are absolutely unique in 
this respect; they depend on both a reading of the SL environment as 
'natural,' and a scripting within and of that environment to produce the 
'unnatural' which is still read as natural. These works, on this level, 
question the authority of the real, of the idiotic real; they're a kind of 
critique that couldn't exist anywhere else. The viewer/participant isn't 
prepared for them. (UPS trucks falling on one!) So one engages both crit- 
ically and psychologically/psychoanalytically - the works create both 
contemplation and affect, in ways we're not used to. And that, at least 
for me, is one of the highest goals of art - to create that sense of 
dis/comfort that gives us a place to question everything, and to return 
from that questioning hopefully wiser. On a personal note, I can't say 
I've found anything as intriguing as Gaz' works, anywhere, and for a long 
time, and I'm still fathoming out the implications, still feeling the 
limbs extended almost to the breaking-point. Gaz is a pioneer in the body 
and space of the Other - and perhaps nothing more need have been said than 
that.
