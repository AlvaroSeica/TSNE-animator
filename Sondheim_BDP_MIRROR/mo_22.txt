of Ch'ien-tzu wen, of the waist of language 





"He perceives the base of infinite space as the base of infinite space.

Having perceived the base of infinite space as the base of infinite space,

he conceives [himself as] the base of infinite space, he conceives [him-

self] in the base of infinite space, he conceives [himself apart] from the

base of infinite space, he conceives the base of infinite space to be

'mine,' he delights in the base of infinite space. Why is that? Because he

has not fully understood it, I say." (Mulapariyaya Sutta: Sutta 1:15,

trans. Nanamoli, Bodhi)
