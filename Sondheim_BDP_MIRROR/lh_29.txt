Parable


Nikuko was wending her solitary way back to Dazaifu; she was tired, and
the path was wet from the recent rains. She came across an old man hobbl-
ing along; he moved slowly, his face twisted with age. Suddenly she felt
herself in the presence of an enlightened being. She asked him who he was,
and discovered he was mute (i.e. he did not reply, either because he could
not speak, or because he could not hear, or because he desired silence
above all else). It was then that she realized he had most likely lost his
mind, slowly withdrawing from the world by virtue of incapacity, which he
had turned to good purpose by focusing on the perfection and evanescence
of all things. She continued on her way, thinking that the emptier the
mind, the greater the flow; by the side of the road, a granite boulder
murmured Aum, and she was enlightened.
