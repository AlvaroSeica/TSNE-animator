"I want earthquakes, because I know that then the earth can breathe."
- Nijinsky -

the great lamina of the stars sway back and forth -
you can see the oldest stars - they are pure and clean -
they are the youngest - they have no motives -

the animal of the victorian woman splayed on the couch -
she is in browns and maroons and red - her legs are naked - spread -
she is the youngest in the world - she has invented language -
she has invented motive -

she sways back and forth on the laminar plane - in tune
with the rhythms of the universe - the laminar plane and stars
are in an 1844 train tunnel riding the harbor to long island - 
the vault is brickwork painted white - you can still see the cinders
on the ceiling - the engines had 7 foot wheels of wood - they
were strapped with iron - the stars sway and disappear into the depths
of the 1844 brooklyn tunnel which is the oldest subway in the world -

the naked woman rides before the stars - her clothes thrown open -
thrown to one side -

memories of trains -

memories of trains - cinders and soot spew forth from an absent 
object - from an invisible object - they make arcs - they spread - 
splay - the tunnel is the space of the nineteenth century -

o loving eye caressing the objects with totality against totality -
searching out tunnels among tunnels, holes among holes - the youngest
stars know thee not, neither the oldest, neither the sun or any
luminary body -

of philosophy -

that language is small labor, the reading and writing of it, the 
speaking of it - the margins of language perform according to 
persuasion and consensus - the world is invisible to the speaking
of the dinosaurs - all culture is a stuttering -

"The earth is alive. It was once a sun." - Nijinski -
