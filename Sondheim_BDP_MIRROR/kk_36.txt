	"I CAN'T LOOK AT YOU" BUT I WRITE IN A BABY PLAYPEN
	CRY IN MY LITTLE PLAYPEN PLAY WITH THE BEADS A BIT
	WAAAAH WAAAAH AND ALL THE REST I'VE DONE IT FOR YEARS
	IN FRONT OF YOU BUT NOW I'M BEHIND YOU AND YOU CAN'T HEAR ME
	YOU CAN'T SEE ME YOU CAN ONLY READ ME 
	YOU CAN ONLY READ ME IF YOU OPEN YOUR EYES LOOK LOOK LOOK
	I'M ALL ALONE HERE IN THIS SPACE I CAN DO ANYTHING I WANT
	SEE I'VE @CUT MY HEAD OFF YOU'LL FIND IT AT ADDRESS &H
	IT'S GONE FROM THIS WORLD NOW I PULL MY LEGS OVER MY NECK
	MY ARMS SURROUND MY LEGS AND I BECOME ALL TOO QUICKLY KNOTTED
	HELP HELP HELP UNTANGLE ME I DO SAY I DO SAY TO NO ONE
	YOU'RE NOT HERE DIDN'T I ALREADY SAY THAT I THINK I'LL SIT DOWN
	MY DRESS WILL GET ALL WET NOW I'LL STAND UP AGAIN
	I'M ALL ALONE AS I DO SAY I THINK I'LL TAKE A WALK
