The Symbolic (which is often difficult to identify)


   "Figure 4.14 presents a young lady with the profound emaciation of
_anorexia nervosa._ This is a common disorder of young and emotionally
immature females who stop eating in response to their abnormal perception
of their body size and image. Amenorrhea often accompanies this disorder. 
This patient demonstrates many of the changes in fat distribution which
can occur in any chronic or debilitating illness. 
    The face dramatically shows the changes of wasting. Loss of tissue at
the temples and cheeks make the zygomatic arches appear prominent - the
'gaunt look.' Hollowing of the supraclavicular fossae and axillae occurs
early. The skin falls in loose, lax folds over the abdomen and upper arms.
The normal fat stored in the buttocks and thighs is also lost and appar-
ent." [...] (Physical Diagnosis, 17th edition, Burnside and McGlynn.)

[...] "Wheals can be raised in 25% of normal patients by stroking the skin
with a blunt object like a tongue blade. This reaction is called _dermato-
graphia_ (Fig. 6.23). _Darier's sign_ is a wheal raised when stroking the
brown papule of an uncommon lesion, urticaria pigmentosa. Malignant histi-
ocytes which diffusely infiltrate the skin in this disease release hista-
mine to produce the wheal reaction. Wheals commonly indicate an allergic
response to an environmental factor, which is often difficult to identify."
