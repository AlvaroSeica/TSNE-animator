to a Friend


will then of these the fiery Furnace -
turning to the left - turning to the right of us -
beyond the grieving earth - above the earth - trembling so -
the bowers breaking - great earth broken with the weight of bodies -
i remember - i abjure you - you grow within me -
i will name you with the names of the future -
i will remember you with all the names of the past -
here we are on the brink - the edge - we need your guidance -
beyond and beneath the Furnace - within the heat of the Furnace -
the convolutions of the marrow - great bone furrows -
the great thinking - the greatness of the thought -

will then of these the fiery Furnace -
reduced, all of us, to silence and dismay - within the east
the great light - within the west, the lips of dawn and dusk -
our speech creating nothing - our speech words flayed into the dark -
our performances poor, the theater smashed, the audience long since gone -
the play a language of discomfort, unknown language, unspoken, lost -
our characters your memory - you're there in every one of them,
speaking to yourself through us, the great winds turning at the poles,
the winds of the Furnace burning the equator, winds of ice,
and everywhere an assumption,
of these, of the great thinking, of the Furnace, of our abeyance,
of death and trees, uprooted, and thinking branches, whole worlds
of thought and ice
