   On the waters
   of the flowing river,
   a jewel, a bead of foam --
   the pity 
   of this fugitive world!
   
   (From Poems of a Mountain Home, translated Burton Watson)
   
   Waters swallowed
   by great big pity foam,
   brilliant, lost --
   but that it was
   inside the world!
   
   The was of the world
   oh just forgotten --
   edgy nerves
   inside and out!
   Home foam! Foam home!
   
   (From I can't Write your Story Because I don't Really Know it,
   but There's a Certainty that Events Occurred, such a Meeting
   Closed within the Foam, and There Would be More as Well, One
   can Almost See Within Them, by Even Lost at the Last Moment, 
   Universal Death and Dissolution.)
