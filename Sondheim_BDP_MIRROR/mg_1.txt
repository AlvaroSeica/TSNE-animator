Take of the Continuity Girl


The continuity girl wears a big baggy sweater and carries a clipboard and
Polaroid camera. She walks among the naked actors and actress and takes
notes, whose hand is where, which face is turned towards - and which away
from - the camera. This is amazing. whose finger has a torn nail - whose
breasts already damp - the degree of nipple erection (easy here) - all of
this is carefully noted by the continuity girl. There is sweat running
from a shoulder. The terrorist has his knife to a neck from the left - no,
from the right - side; "R" appears almost by command on the continuity
chart. Is this the numbered scene, the only scene - the continuity girl
knows, takes everything into account. She writes "Alan is gagged tightly,
he is having trouble breathing. If he suffocates, this will be the only
take." She writes "n/g" as the gag is loosened. Azure has been shaved,
head to toe; Azure is constantly shuddering. The continuity girl writes
"Azure moves - lock structure in edit - there is no room for error - there
is nothing but error." The continuity girl notes the bruises and bites on
four, on five, breasts. She notes, "Day 3." She notes, "This is the second
day." It is the goal of the continuity girl to make sure the world is
whole, to make sure it remains contained, coherent, logical beneath the
chaos the rest of us take for granted.

The Continuity Girl


The continuity girl asserts the fundamental forces of the world. She
writes 5; then 5/under erasure; she writes 4; she exhausts the series. She
adds the cosmological constant, planck's constant; she erases them; she
includes them; she erases them. The slate is a mess. The slate is 
unreadable. The slate mimics the world. The slate becomes the world. She 
continues to write. She is wearing a baggy sweater and carrying a Polaroid 
camera. She carries a great number of accessories: tripod, telephoto, 
wide-angle, scanning-transmission electron microscope, interferometer,
neutron telescope. There are a continuous number of scenes; she numbers 
them according to the continuum. It is not so difficult to describe the 
actors; they are also continuous, and the transformation of props and 
objects occurs according to aristotelian logic and fluid morphology. Only 
certain quantum leaps give her trouble, but these radical discontinuities 
also permit discontinuities within or across scenes, and need not be 
annotated. For the rest, everything appears relatively differentiable.
The slate is a mess. The slate is a continuous mess.

Unit Mo


The continuity girl is nervous. She has dreamed of blood. The set has many
actors. She is sure about her dream. She says "You are deranged." She says
"This is a film not to be made." She says to the director "There are no
actors." She says to the director "I will be your actress." She says to
the director "Do with me what you will." She annotates all continuity. She
says "There is no director." She says "I am the director." She says "I am
sure of it.":The continuity girl wears her baggy sweater. She removes her
sweater. She removes her shirt. She removes her bra. She removes her
pants. She removes her panties. She removes her tampon. She removes her
stopwatch. She puts down her continuity pad. She puts down the script. She
picks up the script. "I will be the star of this and every other film."
The day is night. Her shaved hair is long. Her brown eyes are blue. Her
perfect teeth are crooked. Her heavy legs are thin. Her small breasts are
large. America harbors terrorists in many suburban tracts. They are set to
move against Afghanistan their mortal enemy. Afghanistan is crossroads of
empire. Fundamentalists stream across oceans. Afghanistan is mortally
wounded. The script is soaked in blood. The continuity girl climbs a
tree. The continuity girl wraps up. She has observed the continuity girl.
Against her will she has participated in the film. There are broken
costume changes. The sky is another weather. Her mood is broken. She did
give herself to herself. She did wound herself from the convenient tree.
She did pick up the script from the ground. She did put it inside of
herself. She did read of it through her period the blood. She did note the
crevice of blood across the page. She did note the word "supple""ment" cut
between one stroke and another. :odin-theme:script boy

She is naked-woman. The film is War-Time Fuck. The film is The Truth About 
Angels. The film is Apocalypse Now. The film is Biograph Continuity Girl. 
The film is Mistake of the Century. The film is Miss Take.

biograph continuity girl


who is the continuity girl. she writes and underlines these words; she
checks spelling and stylistic consistency. in the world, she writes, she
makes certain that day is day, night is night; that if day for night, then
not night for day; if night for day, then not day for night. she wears
careful glasses, is twenty-three years old, and a graduate of ucla's
motion picture / television department. she has been an extra in several
post-blair-witch-project student films, shot in will rogers state park.  
she is originally from portland, maine. she studied with leslie thornton
in brown university's modern culture and media department for her
undergraduate work. it was only later that she decided to remain on the
periphery of cinema, closely observing everything around her. the film 
was secondary, she writes, to the continuous reiteration of the real. she 
thinks she is a machine. she thinks she is the perfect eye. she thinks she 
is the inconceivable eye. i am the continuity girl, she writes, who am i.

who is the continuity girl. she writes and underlines these words; she is
killing everything. everything is destroyed and mutilated. what damage
have you done; she... a soldier rapes me. i rape a soldier. i am terror. 
i am terror of the real. i make certain that day is day, night is night;
that if day for night, then what is mine, who is the continuity girl. she
writes and underlines these words: SHE IS YOURS. SHE IS YOUR BIOTERRORISM 
HERE. i dream of the naked dead-man, she writes. i am hungry. i make 
things.

she is in the armor. she writes, i owe everything to leslie thornton and 
john malkovich. she writes, i will be naked all the time. she takes off 
her baggy sweater. she writes, i am of the real. n/g. i am the real. i am
film. armies film me. i will write their names. the glass is on the right- 
hand side. it is cloudy out and 9 o'clock in the early night. she writes, 
people are dying. she writes, people are staring at me.

i am happy.

she makes certain that day is day, night is night; that if day for night,
then:checks spelling and stylistic consistency. in the world, she writes,
she:who is the continuity girl. she writes and underlines these words;
she:thinks she is a machine. she thinks she is the perfect eye. she thinks
she :careful glasses, is twenty-three years old, and a graduate of ucla.
