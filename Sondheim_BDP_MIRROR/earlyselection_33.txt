MOM SCREAMS ! DAD GOES HUNTING ! OUR CHILDREN ARE OUR FUTURE !

Yaah yaah yaah they're at it again, over and over again, in this age of
Internet technology, gluing the nuclear family with piano wire, strang-
ling MOMMYDADDYBABY altogether, what a muddle! Every other TV commercial
again has the children, _THE FUCKING CHILDREN,_ taken away - it's no long-
er diseases, no longer couples breaking apart - we're past the DIVORCE era
- it's the kids, the Kids, the KIDS, now - every mother reduced to the
stupidity of groveling before the little tyke - there's no other role for
her - because MOM's now a FUNCTION, little-kid-appendage, all-smiles DAD's
also a MAN of ACTION - the KIDS? - they're transitive, tokens of exchange,
Kula/Hula - they're the STUD holding the leather together, the NUT on the
SCREW - the kids are the bourgeois CONTRACT, REIFICATION-OPERATOR - they
make ONTOLOGY - well FUCK THE KIDS, let them fall off the face of the
earth - enough of this crap I say! - time to get a MOVE-ON! - you WANT
your baby back? DON'T HAVE IT IN THE FIRST PLACE - what are you gonna do
when it LEAVES HOME - you and SPOUSE all alone - CHRIST, THE LOOK IN YOUR
EYES! - I say: GET RID OF THESE SHOWS - THESE FILMS - THESE TINY TOKENS OF
WHITE BLOND CUTENESS! DIVORCE! YOU DESERVE ABSOLUTE HAPPINESS! YOU DESERVE
THE FULFILLMENT OF YOUR DESIRES! FUCK THE KIDNAPPERS! HAVE A GOOD TIME!
LEAVE THE GODDAMN AMERICAN PLANET PANIC EARTH  !!!!!
