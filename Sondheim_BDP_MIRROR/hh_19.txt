The Fitting of Theory


She added that the theory had to fit, configure itself, within a file 'zz'
- a universal name that traversed texts in their entirety. There could be
appendages as well, jpegs, wavs, anything in fact that reduced itself to
binary at the very least. But the text was always 'zz,' manipulated as
precipitate or sinter. 

Texts can be either part-objects-zz or transitional-objects-zz; clearly
the latter are transitive, while the former occlude the intransitive -
they're fading-objects, translucencies that shatter at a moments' touch.
The transitional-objects-zz are open sets, just as the part-objects-zz
attempt foreclosure. 

Circuits are created across these objects, and self-reflexivity construes
a variable and fuzzy cyclicity characteristic of transitional-objects-zz:
circulation, circumambulation, circumscription. Ripples are created among
these objects, blurring their epistemological wagers; these are character-
istic of fading-objects, dismemberments, imaginaries, phantoms, cortical
excitations.

The doubled order, she added, constituted the theoretical moment. At that
moment, she added a degree of insurgency. It was at that moment, inexact,
but future theory and a theory of the future, doubled over.
