"Of necessity, a commodity-based society produces such phantom objectivi-
ty, and in so doing it obscures its roots - the relations between people. 
This amounts to a socially instituted paradox with bewildering manifesta-
tions, the chief of which is the denial by the society's members of the
social construction of reality. Another manifestation is the schizoid
attitude with which the nmembers of such a society necessarily confront
the phantom objects that have been thus abstracted from social life, an
attitude that shows itself to be deeply mystical. On the one hand, these
abstractions are cherished as real objects akin to inert things, whereas
on the other, they are thought of as animate entities with a life-force of
their own akin to spirits or gods. Since these 'things' have lost their
original connection with social life, they appear, paradoxically, both as
inert and as animate entities. If the test of a first-rate intelligence is
the ability to hold two opposed ideas at the same time and still retain
the ability to function, then the modern mind can truly be said to have
proved itself."
