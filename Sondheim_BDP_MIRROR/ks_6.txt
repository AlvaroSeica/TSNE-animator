I hear you Jennifer, I hear you speaking to me, you are speaking to me
now, you are saying, wake wake wake, you are saying, never you will not
sleep again, you are

"We regard the voices that torment the schizophrenic as a symptom, in
which a special mode of involvement is likewise manifested. The voices are
heard, they are acoustic phenomena, but there are also different enough to
contrast with all else that is audible. The mode of their reception is ra-
ther a being-affected, simlar to hearing. The voices emerge in a deranged
acoustic sphere and encounter the patient in a relation to the _Other_
which most resembles hearing; they are quasi-acoustic."

In the middle of the night you are coming towards me
you are seizing my loins
you are ceasing my mind
In the middle of the night you make an impression on me
your breasts sink into my own
my chest caves down cough cough
my cock disappears yawn yawn
                                swallowed by your _vociferous laugh_

"With the paralysis of action the boundary which separates the _Other_
from the experiencing being is shifted. We who speak of hallucinations are
convinced that the voices heard by the patient are his voices. He experi-

You make an impression Jennifer-Julu
branding your cunt into my eyes so yes yes yes I can see
all the tellings in the whole wide world
all the namings in the whole wide world

                   the tellings beat up on the namings
                   because they go to war on the namings
                   the namings drip through your breasts
                   into my sunken chest

I am Jennifer-Naming-Horde 
I have stolen your name

                   now you are stolen
                   this is what invisible means
