'standiP upp, jotnar! ok straiP bekki!'

Stand up, giants! And straw the benches! First get the straw! 
Then straw the benches! I'm getting married! Pick up a tree.
You never know! upp-himinn there! We might fall down! 
Where are the women! Pykkir mer or augum eldr of brenna!
I think to myself her eyes, wow! They're burning! Now how
Are the elves doing! What's with the gods here! Hold on, 
Don't let the straw burn! Pick up the bench! Put the bench
Down! You picked up the bench! ek I can't believe this!
Sit down where you stood! First straw the benches! O giants,
Sit down!
