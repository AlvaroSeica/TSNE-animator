everywhere on me, my legs are splayed, almost in pain
yes.. pressing you so hard against the wall, flattening you, splaying you as
well, my face rough against your own


i want to wear you want to wear you in pain and pleasure always knowing
the touch of you always knowing the breath the blood of you
i am so swollen you must penetrate me now, trembling, my blood flowing on to
you... yes, all blood, all blood....
my legs are spread wide, i can smell my shit mingled with yours, yours is
