what margaret knew


the hole is given by the rim, the delineation; the rim is fissured from
the same, opening miasma; it is the miasma that participates in the
sacred; the sacred inebriates the hole.

the rim job is the locus of labor in the hole, absorption / annihilation;
the rim job is the labor of supplication and fulfillment, recuperation of
the body's / absent / bodies.

the soul is stained; the rim knows nothing of the depth. every movement of
the organism, arm and leg and mouth speaking, occurs within what might be
considered the _(phantom) limb of the hole,_ that is to say its extension
or the gap between its extension and what has never been known. 

nor is this the matter of parameters or dimension, something that one is
unutterably clear about, concerning. nor that writing, nor language.

no matter what you say. you can say all you want to. she said.

""destroy," she said."
