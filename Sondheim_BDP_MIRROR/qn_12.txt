Intentionality and suturing of the subject:

Suturing in real life: cohering subjectivity, harmonic continuity, 
incoherent and dynamic inscribing: what is inscribed, erodes, corrodes, 
decays, disintegrates; the subject, subjectivity of the subject, dies. 
While alive, the body continues, is continuous; there is no teleporting, 
no disappearance. The body physically moves in and out of presence; in 
real life, there are no (space/time) jump cuts. And the body decays; 
existing in a potential well (clothing, shelter, skin), it is always 
subject to collapse, death, detritus. The body ingests, excretes.

Suturing in virtual worlds: coherent physics, discordant continuity, 
coherent inscribing (it's inscription that holds it together). In other 
words, in virtual worlds, one's avatar is present or not present, 'alive' 
or not 'alive' - the inscription is coherent, holding everything together 
- but the virtual body is not always there. Teleporting disrupts contin- 
uity for others, not for the avatar 'owner' or the avatar itself. The body 
need not ingest or excrete (unless it is written into the virtual world 
itself); it need not sleep, does not get sick, and so forth. In virtual 
worlds, the body shape may be mobile, transformable, as well.

Problematic issues of ontology of re life: virtual particles, information 
entanglement and conservation, no backup.
