Jennifer:

I destroyed the poem. Open Jennifer Alan open open open. It was bad. The
spaces were ok. They didn't fill well. What the lines said. The between,
legs or lines. I want to put everything into me. Limbs. To ride the world. 
Stuff falls out. Rivers down my legs, stuff. Valley mud. My cunt smells of
world. I'm not Phaedra. I'd scream that. Not to be that. 

Nights are hardest. Screams from ankles knees. I walk down streets spread
myself naked, labia into perfect circle. No light. Murmur, cup your ear.
Alan, cup your ear. Pour into you. Screams from legs, asshole. Your mouth
open. Open open Jennifer Alan. Open up.

I destroyed the poem. Atoms burn. Charred flesh in me. I rage in me. Tear
my skin apart. Breasts jut. Jennifer Alan. Skin stepped from skin. A
single foot. Ripped open. Splayed. Nights are hardest. My cunt fucks dead
worlds. In Jennifer's time. Alan Alan. See Jennifer sit. Jennifer Alan.
See Jennifer; run.
