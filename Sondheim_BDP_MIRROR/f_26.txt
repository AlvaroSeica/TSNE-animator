Carefully Read Before Anything Else!


... "whereas our whole art struggles to enforce the 'life,' the 'reality'
of fictive beings, the very structure of Japanese restores or confines
these beings to their quality as _products,_ signs cut off from the alibi
referential par excellence: that of the living thing." (Barthes, Empire of
Signs.)

To be sure, by way of a _necessary introduction,_ a capital surmounting 
the column of prose, to which I dedicate this post, from henceforth until 
two days following, write in and be included!

Fortune: You will become involved with the person who has written you the 
very text post; my lover frames it with the following post. If this is, 
in other words, post x, be assured that your future partner has written 
x+1, and that my current partner is to be found, alas, separated from 
me, in x+2. 

However, I am owed a great deal of money by the individual who has written
the _post before last_ - just so you know who you're dealing with... 

And happiness becomes me! Three posts down, immediately following my 
current partner at x+2, please note: My child has written a first post to 
the Internet! As a proud father, I am sharing this with you; please 
forgive my immodest behavior in this instance!

Alas, three posts before this, at unlucky x-3 (and luck always comes in 
threes!), the cause of my death - decades from now. Read back three 
posts, and all will be revealed...

But again, what concern is that of yours? It is _this very post_ that 
tells of _your_ good fortune, future happiness, and a life filled with 
joyous accomplishments!

I salute you!

Alan!
