The Ineffable Brought Back Below


Simplices are generated in n-dimensional geometry by connecting the n-1
simplex to a point in the nth dimension (i.e. not co-n-1 with it). Begin
with a point, then a line segment, triangle, tetrahedron, etc. For dim 0
and 1, the total number of elements are respectively 1 and 3. This is also
true for the measure polytope, point, line segment, square, cube, etc.  
The latter is formed by sliding the entire n-1 measure polytope along an
orthogonal n-flat. The total number of elements in a simplex is 2^(n+1)-1
which may be seen inductively; given an n-dimension simplex, the slide to
n+1 creates 2(2^(n+1)-1)+1 elements - doubling through the 'smear,' the
last 1 for the given point drawing the rest out, almost skein-like. This
reduces to 2^(n+2)-2+1 = 2^(n+2)-1 elements for the n+1 simplex, i.e.
2^((n+1)+1)-1. Something also about binomial coefficients. For a measure
polytope, the total elements are 3^n; this can also be shown inductively.
For dim 0, the point, 3^0= 1 and 2^1-1 = 1; for dim 1, 3^1 = 3 and 2^2-1 =
3; dim 0 and dim 1 may be considered a phenomenological basis for these
generations, identical for simplex and measure polytope. Note these two
forms carry upward through the n-dimensional polytopes; this isn't true of
the other platonic solids. Now consider n = -1; then the simplex is 2^0-1
= 0; this is the ineffable point, without elements or substance. The sim-
plex below or beneath the series disappears, or might as well disappear.
Elements and elementals.

This is the ineffable point; we may read Derrida as subaltern extension:

"(50) Calculability: question, apparently arithmetic, of two, or rather of
n + One, through and beyond the demography of which we spoke above. Why
should there always have to be _more than_ one source? There would not
have to be two sources of religion. There would be faith and religion,
faith or religion, because _there are at least two._ Because there are,
for the best and for the worst, division and iterability of the source.  
This supplement introduces the incalculable at the heart of the calcula-
ble. (Levinas: 'It is this being-two _<etre a deux>_ that is human, that
is spiritual.') But the more than One _<plus d'Un>_ is at once more than
two.  There is no alliance of two, unless it is to signify in effect the
pure madness of pure faith. The worst violence. The more than One is this
n + One which introduces the order of faith or of trust in the address of
the other, but also the mechanical, machine-like division (testimonial
affirmation and reactivity, 'yes, yes', etc., answering machine and the
possibility of _radical evil:_ perjury, lies, remote-control murder,
ordered at a distance even when it rapes and kills with bare hands."
("Faith and Knowledge," in Derrida and Vattimo, Religion, trans. Weber.)

It is Pythagorean in the sense of an empathetic harmony between number, 
numeracy, and the real, drawn out into neoplatonisms. It is desire 
manifest in an absolute that drops out at the bottom of the scale; in a 
very inert sense, nothing is below zero, neither negative nor imaginary, 
neither fraction nor transcendental, neither inaccessibly high finite, nor 
infinite. It stops there, as the nub or apex, the world under erasure, the 
world not yet declared.

And it is a false derivation; a false transmission precisely within and by 
virtue of the scriptures, and the violence is there.

It's the curlicue, the diacritical mark, to the effect that 0' -> 1, tends
towards one; there is always a unique successor among the integers. One 
you start, there's no stopping; one an axiomatic system is laid out as in 
Euclid, or parameters declared, everything follows. Everything, but not 
necessarily _that_ One, which requires an extra effort, although it was 
always there by the self-performative of its own beginning; it's curious.

911: phenomenology, premonition


Derrida, Faith and Knowledge, 1994, p 24 -


Like others before, the new 'wars of religion' are unleashed over the
human earth (which is not the world) and struggle even today to control
the sky _with finger and eye_: digital systems and virtually immediate
panoptical visualization, 'air space', telecommunications satellites,
information highways, concentration of capitalistic-mediatic power - in
three words, _digital culture, jet_ and _TV_ without which there could be
no religious manifestation today, for example no voyage or discourse of
the Pope, no organized emanation _<rayonnement>_ of Jewish, Christian, or
Muslim cults, whether 'fundamentalist' or not.


Sondheim, Disorders of the Real, 1988, 103 -


What the Engine Does, of the Anorectic Airliner

The Engine swallows the air; it is the point at which the movement of air
and its dispersion begins. This is an act of devouring, gorging, the
bulimic cycle which collapses as the world is absorbed. It is a
transformation into substance as the Engine appropriates the foundations
of the signifier for itself. What an appropriation! The Engine inscribes
the absorbed world in an exhaust trail. The Engine parallels the photon;  
it refuses position as the tokenization of existence; it exists as
movement and collapse. Thus it flies and desires the air. Thus it
appropriates and seduces the air, through an act of violence which retains
its position of flight. For that which would escape it, Engine, cruise
missile, bomb, what is being said but the "I" of the engine, within a
dialectic of seduction?  Seduction in which the Origin is proclaimed, and
that is the metric established as Origin, the location of the phallus. The
cruise missile cocks its head, gives it to the world. It is semen which is
disorganized;  the world burns into paste through an atmosphere of paste,
through an Engine of paste. The world burns, the Engine burns, swells,
disgorges; it is the world returned to vomit.The anorectic airliner
shudders (therefore shudders); the line of flight is re-established. Such
an establishment with markings in the sky! Such a sky that establishes
itself as a graph with mobile coordinates, exhaust that indicates while it
dissipates, is absorbed in the clutter of the air. The tiny Engine! The
presence of Flight! The erection in the sky and the charred earth! It is
the appearance of the microtechnological once again, the bacteriophage
with its consonant and identical units. It is an empty circle. It is the
exhaustion of repetitive expansion.

it is time to face armageddon
prepare for your death
there is not enough time but there is no time for the will or contract
there is no one to leave to
there is no memory
nothing is of account and nothing will be accounted for
there is no emptiness in massive death
the world will return to substance
fires continue to burn beneath the world trade center
we do not recognize ourselves in ash yah yah
our skin already begins to fall
our breath is shorter
all we have left to do is recognize this fundamental truth
we are close to extinction
prepare for this
make peace
resign
