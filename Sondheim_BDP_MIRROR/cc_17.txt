When you walk naked through the door of the camera in the wall
on my machine in Windows opening only to that door where the 
camera is against the wall, then you repeat that walk

You repeat that walk until it glows over and over again, until
the act of walking naked doesn't stop but continues through
our naked bodies watching here on the other side

They shudder because there is no side to the other, and the other
is a shudder, and because memory remains, that of your body
and every inch beneath the breast and legs open in an eye

Which is a book of ordinary and your limbs break glass in Windows
on my machine from your machine, and your joining us before us
like an altar or table is just what one would like

Those thick files flying, your walk unencountered, 
and then that walk, then you repeat that walk
