I can't sleep so I write this. I keep checking for mail. Late at night 
when you are asleep. Nothing comes. Maybe you are awake and hate me. I 
don't know. I hope not. I wouldn't want you to hate me. But I am awake 
and there is nothing from you and I miss your words. My body splits into 
pieces. There is debris everywhere on the ground.
