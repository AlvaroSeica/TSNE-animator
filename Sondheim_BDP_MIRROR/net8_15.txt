HONEY: My beautiful hair covers beautiful Kent's sleeping body, Kent 

and Frank loving each other so... My smile fills my children with joy,

ntalk in real-life, don't we TIFFANY?



[Net time-line]: General list crash occurred 7/15/94: Survived: MARX,

CADRE-L, FICTION-OF-PHILOSOPHY. MAJORDOMO/LISTSERV/INFO-PERSON names

changed to CYBERMIND. AUTOMATED CYBERMIND.



CYBERMIND FEEDBACK INTO OTHER: 

@1: MARVIN MINSKY PROTOCOL: "_THE DUPLICATION PROBLEM. The states of 

two different agencies cannot be compared unless those agencies them-

selves are virtually identical._ But this is only the tip of the ice-

berg, for it is not enough that the descriptions to be compared emerge

from two almost identical agencies. These agencies must, in turn, re-

ceive inputs of near identical character. And for _that_ to come 

about, each of their subagencies must also fulfill that same constant.

The only way to meet all those conditions is for both agencies - _and

all the subagencies upon which they depend_ - to be identical. _Un-

less we find another way, we'll need a host of duplicated brains!_"

@2: EMMANUEL LEVINAS PROTOCOL: "The non-signifyingness of erotic 

nudity does not precede the signifyingness of the face as the 

obscurity of formless matter precedes the artist's forms. It already

has forms behind it; it comes from the future, from a future situated

beyond the future wherein possibles scintillate, for the chaste nudity

of the face does not vanish in the exhibitionism of the erotic. The

indiscretion in which it remains mysterious and ineffable precisely is

attested by the exorbitant inordinateness of this indiscretion. Only

the being that has the frankness of the face can be `discovered' in 

the non-signifyingness of the wanton [lascif]."



GEORGE: On CLARA-L we offer ourselves against all protocols for the

establishment of CADRE-L or its denumeration; names rattle against 

names, recognitions collapse in inert denumerations, closed gateways,

cypherpunk breakthroughs into NULL SET LACKNETS: nets without story,

without backup, without DEFRAG, nets of OTHERS MIXTURES

SYNAESTHESIA HYSTERIA DEEP-SEA ANGLER FUCK: The deep-sea angler female

absorbs males into her body; the males lose all differentiation,

remaining only as external sperm sacs.



A sensation produced through one sense is `felt by another.' The body

is inhabited by an other. Hysteria locates the other on the topography

of the flesh. KENT: knee; FRANK: waist; TIFFANY: breast; HONEY: knee.
