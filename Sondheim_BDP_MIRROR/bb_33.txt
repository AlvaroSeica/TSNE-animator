You Earth!


Near dawn, near five in the morning here, I am going to sleep; this day, 
I have napped far too much, out of necessity, unable to stay awake, my 
schedule in shambles

But I do rise and I am privileged to see the great cycles of the day and 
night softly shutter our planet, and this is a privilege that could only 
come through Internetting everywhere

For I see you signing off and signing on, one by one by one, whole con-
tinents of you, the Australians now towards evening as my body trembles 
waiting for tomorrow-here, Europe bleary with morning logins, America 
sleeping soundly behind me

And some of you greet me on MOO or talker or ytalk or email, beginning or
ending your day as proclamations embrace the world, small dreaming in my
hands, planet-earth beneath me as my fingers touch keys, laptop, bed and
building, down deep into the rock strata beneath the dark cement, chords
connecting me to you, wherever you are

This amazement, this space, these points, felicitations ! The planetary 
membrane, inscriptions like lightning, sparks everywhere, moving through 
all continents, slowly gathering speed - wait, you'll see ! Dawn, haze, 
beautiful suns !

Hello, hello !

Good night, good night !

Good morrow !
