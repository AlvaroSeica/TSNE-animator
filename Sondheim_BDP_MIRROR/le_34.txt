on his return

in the midst of thick text
that everyone writes, making barriers,
setting traps where i'm coming,
arrows and staked pits where i'm crossing
the great writing, i keep dreaming, jennifer,
who returns from other pages, disks, entries,
who leaps across files, directories, machines,
as if one always began with jennifer the root,
jennifer always ready at the prompt and waiting,
or jennifer@jennifer.com and jennifer@jennifer.com 
,
her legs wrap around my throat at night,
she's naked, my tongue is swallowed, i inhale her,
there's nothing left of me and i want less than that,
she's on me, i breath her into me,
my lungs are full of blood from her,
my eyes are seeing read through her,
my eyes are eyes of jennifer,
i'm in her cunt, i'm coming into her,
coming through, and the dream of men in a forest,
my mouth speaking in tones of a woman, 
my breasts larger and swollen, i feed myself,
i'm alway naked, infant, i drool and topple,
hollow, where my cock was, i'm in a universe,
i am a universe,
maybe i can get some sleep tonight
,
jennifer coughs and spits me out her mouth, what's left,
i want less than that, i'm a carpet stain, 
buried in cloth
, 
today i was walking with azure in a subway tunnel, 
she said, the ceiling's low,
i said, that's the expression, but at least here and now,
it's the floor that's high
