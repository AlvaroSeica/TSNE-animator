when they came down to the village, it was time to leave; there were
trees in bloom around the square; there were the buildings of clay and
mud; when they came down to the village there were the Squares of the
Assyrians, the streets of Akkadia, and the square was Sargon Square;
when I returned there would be other names, women in black ululation,
men rummaging around the _affects;_ there were dogs, there were other
animals, cattle baying in the distance; sheep lowing in the feld; when
there were returns, the whole village would come out and greet them;
when there were caravans, we would come in from the sun to the tents,
purple and gold would be our color; we would lie together in the shadow
of the cedar and palm; we would bathe together when the water overran
the fields; who would own this life, we would ask one another, our hands
running over our bodies; who would own all of this, the heaven and the
earth, the soul and the m'e; the square would fill up with strangers; we
would ask ourselves, who are these men and women, what is the tongue
spoken by the children in the evening; ah, if I could convey the sound
of the animals, the songs of the women, the harps of the men gazing over
the fields, having come from a long way off; the laughter and cries of
the children; ah, if I could convey the camels' burden, the oxen and the
heron in the marsh; the Square of the town gets a new name, now called
Emerald, now called Square of the Martyrs, now called Innannu, now
called Abumelech; the Square of the town is renamed, now called Estyr
Square, Plaza of Sirosh, the Mezzanine of the Fallen; now called
yaya yyaayy yaya yyaayy yaya yyaayy yaya yyaayy yaya yyaayy yaya yyaayy
Dedication-Plaque of Plague; now the square shimmers in the heat; the
flies seethe generation after generation; so I might speak of the
dancing in the evening by the fire; so I might, if the mood overtakes
me, talk of learning the tablets when I was younger; Er'Ah/Seh bringing
back the grain from the fields with the long reed pressed into the
service of the surface of Ayel; if I could erect the stars, they would
come before you with scaffolding; if I could harbor the hills, they
would shore themselves up with ramparts and deep moats walling the
valleys surrounding the trees groaning with fruit at the base; in the
town, the merchants call themselves The Way of the Merchants; the Square
fills with camels; there are goats baaing tethered for their milk and
meat; sacks unload obsidian and myrrh; I have seen velvet, I have owned
a tunic of satin, which we would have worn, had there been the length
of the span of a moon, had there been quincunx in the dark sky at dusk;
once, I have heard of a land of great rain, where water melts surface
into mirrors, and for a moment, the square is filled with scattered
blood and pigs' brains; where dogs might die roaming the mountains; once
I saw a beautiful young woman plait her black hair with henna and the
oil of olives, eyes open to the sky at dawn; the town square, called the
Way of the Temple of Shumer is filled with herds of cows and barking
dogs; I have been through Widows' Square and the Plaza of the Unfortun-
ates; musicians travel through here, and in my youth I heard the Sarala
played as you might welcome Julu; these flooded streets awash with bod-
ies floating across the Plaza of the Great Flood; we would turn slowly,
moving the Arala ahead of us, as if trembling in each and every limb

Self-portraiture is an occasional strongpoint of an operating system;
here are three examples (and note the differences between iconic and
indexical self-reference):


In {b:1} clock reports on the system CMOS clock; time time time reports on
the time it take to report on the time it takes to report on the time it
takes to report on the clock. This could form a recursive program neatly
tying up the CPU (see first entry), or at the least, making it stutter.

In this example {b:8} uses w to report on users, including the user who is
using w to report on users. But don't forget that GNU stands recursively
for GNU Not Unix, and what would one expect?

{b:8} w

  7:12pm  up 11 min,  3 users,  load average: 0.16, 0.06, 0.01
User     tty       login@  idle   JCPU   PCPU  what

root     ttyp0     7:03pm                      w
root     ttyp1     7:03pm     7                pico -z zz


Finally, in {b:11} ps lists the running processes; I've edited this down
(it's rather lengthy) to indicate that one of the processes is ps itself.

{b:11} ps
  PID TTY STAT  TIME COMMAND
...
  233 s01 S <   0:00 -dip (166.84.250.149)
  239 pp0 R <   0:00 ps
...


There are other examples, such as whoami, who am i, netstat, id, who,
users,* and so forth, but these particular ones fascinate me, because of
the glimpse into a fragmented mirror: _everything running on schedule._
