s/ms


Like every steering metaphor s/ms collapse on close examination; on one
hand they are processes, and on the other, particulations or sinters that
accompany process. One might think of them as becomings, but that implies
an internalization or intrinsic structure that doesn't necessarily hold. I
prefer to think of them as local or global, articulating - as the mouthing
of phonemes, typing of letters, assemblage of packets, machine languag-
ings, atmospheric viral cloudings - broadcast transmissions, analog or di-
gital - chaotic phenomena, and for that matter, stochastic phenomena that
escape the potential of recuperable histories. They are the subject of
postmodern analyses - you might look at dismemberings of bodies and body
politics for example. Psychoanalytically, I think of mouths and fasteners
or linkages and couplings. Metaphorically, I think of _chains, glue, and
meaning._ Chains are partial, serial or parallel; viral clouds are chains
in this regard. Glue is anything from proximity to well-ordering, from
concatenation or accumulation to rigid designation. And meaning is a base
in the relationship between attribution and sememes - reading "blue" for
example as one of a number of colors, whether or not otherwise constituted
by difference.
