titanium neon


because it is inert, because it refuses writing;
because it constitutes a sheen difficult or impossible to inscribe;
because it draws forth the desire of memory to hold fast;
because it is drawn forth of memory held fast;

precisely because of its weight and vacuity, it remains impossible in its 
relation to organism, and it is this impossibility that seduces.

whatever is uttered is already in relation to density and absence; the 
stranger is ignored in the city; archaic graphemes remain indecipherable 
until the passing of certain thresholds.

"it" helps through my helplessness, this naming of two elements.

searching for service

can you keep your cell phone in its cradle after charging?
should the cradle be unplugged?
what happens if you misdial and make a new friend?

would you come into my world if i came into yours?
do you think in whispers with your cell phone online?
do you receive web messages that excite you with their tone?

tell me about being and process, cell phone.
do you carry your being with you? do you speed-dial being?
of what would it be within this world, to have been spoken-for with
the speech of which you are the custom, the circulation within which
you are the culture, the cell phone, of which you are the harbinger
of new humans caught within the construction of creativity and
annihilation?
tell me about the world.

not enough crops


listen you, i am an ignorant tip of your world's economy; listen you, my
skin rips, it is so very soft; listen you, there is no room for kindness;
i go towards my doom in rusted cities; i swallow my doom in violent seas;
there are no fish; there's nothing anywhere; brother, brother, do not save
me; sister, sister, you are my sister no longer; i go emptied into
catastrophe; i beg you, kill me; i beg you, kill me, kill again; i walk on
the charred ruins of families; i see the future like none other; this is
the future:

:listen you, i am the ignorant tip of this world's economy; listen you,
there is no other; i am invaded by the market; my skin is cloned; my skin
is for sale; you buy my eyes; you buy my heart working under this harsh
sun; this heat will kill all living things; mother, mother, you are dead
to me; mother, mother, you have cut off my arms, my legs; mother, mother,
you have sold my eyes;

:listen you, i am the ignorant tip of the world's economy; i burn under
this harsh sun; i dream of lives worsened by famine, plague, the
destruction of war; there is no stopping me; i am stopped everywhere;
listen you, i cannot read; listen you, i cannot read what you are writing;
listen you, are you writing me; listen you, my head is a nub, a sensitive
aerial; i move because i am ordered to; i will carry a gun and kill many
people; this is my promise to this violent planet; father, father, i am
burning; father, father, i will take you out; ::everyone is done with
everyone else

in the family-way there is no future
everyone is done with everyone else
kill for money
nothing but money
i am guilty of all asservation

astonishing


crushed metal wreckage, blood and flesh interstitial
everything caught between mechanisms and components
embryonic mewlings, bodies and limbs scattered among stem cells
desperate last-minute growth as desiccation sets in, thwarted life
oh death along the vector the highway shot into darkness

just now i saw her saying goodbye by the side of the road
the road was disappearing before and behind her
she was walking out into the darkness of the other movie
her name was claire danes and she was walking in 1995
oh i was watching, gave her the tiniest stem cell of my gift

in 1995 i died holding her picture in my hands
she looked at my tiniest gift shortly after with greatest sadness
the clock ran backwards but seemed to reverse everything
the highway shot into light, life was water-nourished,
bodies grew strong, limbs joined into all of us
and we drove swiftly and far down the beautiful highway,
oh reaching at last our astonishing destination

sonnet(14)

the way it works it begins with an equivalence annulled:
0 -> f(x)
this refuses to hold the quantity changes such that
0(t) -> f(x)(t+1) so that it becomes necessary to create
0(t) > f(x)(t+n) where n = minimum of 2 so that
a surplus continues to exist
let the phrase = [U] or universe of travel/travail
on the road, in the midst of travel
0 -> 1
so that _now_ t(0) i write _ahead of the game_
which is the game of _textual production_
a series of texts T0, T1, ... Tn
therefore i am capable of keeping up the _appearance_
of textual creativity by always writing ahead of myself

nikuko says: i'm on the road, i'm traveling in a strange land.
jennifer says: this land's familiar to me, there's no buffer here.
nikuko says: there's no memory, buffer's always memory.
jennifer says: always short-term, always there when you need it.

nikuko says: hello alan, i'm on the road, i can't see anything any more.
jennifer says: hello alan, i'm here, i see everything, even the future.
alan says: what's the future for everyone everywhere, jennifer?
jennifer says: it is coming low, you have to duck, it will hit you.
nikuko says: the sky is getting darker already, i can't see the road.
alan says: pull over, nikuko, never fear invisible spirits.
nikuko says: the invisible pulls me towards the side like the wheel pulls.
jennifer says: the invisible is always a veering.
enter alan
nikuko says: hello alan. i am in darkness. thick darkness surrounds me.
alan says: this is from the past. the past is broken.
jennifer says: the absolute is not death; it is the breaking of the past.
nikuko says: every breaking is a death of past, present, future.
alan says: we run among wreckage; that is our exhaustion.
jennifer says: our exhaustion is always already broken.
alan says: the broken is dust.

nikuko says: it is darker and darker, the darkness of black earth.

this was done to occupy a space
this occurs only on an email list
in the space of an email list
within the zone of the list the list zone
this was done as an enunciation
there is always a place for this enunciation:
as soon as it appears its pleasure!
this was done a great while ago a long time ago
this was written before you were here
inscribed before your presence
an inscription waiting for your arrival
without knowledge of your arrival
without the perspicacity of your knowledge
this already has been and occupied its space
this grants you the power of the witness
you are that witness 
of the space you are that witness
"alan enters"
you are that witness

book. second go.


the relationship of consciousness to the world vis-a-vis structure, 
abstraction, symbolic systems. but the relationship of consciousness to 
its inscription: who is inscribing:

the quasi-logical structure of the lifeworld. but which lifeworld, which 
state of confusion, which state of health:

the potential for philosophical investigation through audio-visual and 
other media. but what style, what genre: whose investigation, what gender, 
what methodology, what deployment of desire:

the natural order of structure. but what nature: whose nature: whose 
cooperation: whose corporation: but what contractuality:

consciousness in relation to subjectivity. but what consciousness: what 
eidetic reduction: what cognitive mappings: what mathematical 
catastrophes: what tropes:

virtual subjectivity and its relation to protocols, the imaginary, and 
linguistic performativity. but which protocols: whose imaginary against 
what inscription and whose thetic: but what languages and what mechanisms 
of performance/perforation:

the entrapment and proliferation of detail in a partially-cooled universe 
between plasma and annihilation. but which inscription and which seal: 
but what decade and what millennium: but what substrate and cosmological 
constant:

the orders and relationships among communication, communality, and 
sexuality. but what mind lost among them:

fragility and specificity of operability and the human. but what goodness: 
but what taxonomies of errors, mistakes, phenomenologies of corrupted or 
failed teleologies, what judgments, what ethos:

propositional logics and the elsewhere of the sheffer stroke and its dual.
but whose withdrawal of the not-both-a-and-b, whose banishment of neither- 
a-nor-b:

doubt and deconstruction of conclusions. but whose doubt against what 
standards and relativisms: what auguries of truth and denial: what 
obsessional neuroses: what ignorance, incoherencies:

the scientific as that methodology among others, in spite of heuristic 
breakdowns and the problematic of mathematics. what crystalline mechanism 
inherent of the tractatus-logico-philosophicus, what neoplatonism, what 
conventions, inscriptive labor:

the topology of intention and neurality in relation to externalized mind 
and memory. but what privilege of data-banks, whose computers, whose 
optical fiber, whose skein of satellites, what membranes and firewalls, 
whose hackings and what penetrations:

partial-objects and partial-mappings as givens in the construction and 
reconstruction of the world. but of the gathering of accumulations and 
assemblage of fragments, of the clutter and a-historicity of the world:

theoretical abstraction. what stories hidden with failures, ridden with 
failures, gaps in texts, hiatus, ignorance: what negations (there are 
none): what tales (they're all fiction): what parables (pretense!):

exhaustion, defuge, and the wavering of existence in terms of the physical 
well-being of the body, as well as the deconstruction of that well-being.

syntactic endings:

what writing: what loss of writing to the world:

book. third go at it.


the relationship of consciousness to the world vis-a-vis structure,
abstraction, symbolic systems. but the relationship of consciousness to
its inscription: who is inscribing: veering back from the concern, blind
ambition (see anecdotal) tending towards theoretical thwarting, return of
the repressed

the quasi-logical structure of the lifeworld. but which lifeworld, which
state of confusion, which state of health: consideration of obsessional
neurosis as the holding-forth of the world, radical deposition

the potential for philosophical investigation through audio-visual and
other media. but what style, what genre: whose investigation, what gender,
what methodology, what deployment of desire: questions of periodization,
extension of media on a continuous feed-forward basis, inextricably tied
down to corporate research and development programs

the natural order of structure. but what nature: whose nature: whose
cooperation: whose corporation: but what contractuality: the natural world
under the sign of capital, in-corporation, em/bodiment of nature, the body
politic, political body, structure transformed into performance, action

consciousness in relation to subjectivity. but what consciousness: what
eidetic reduction: what cognitive mappings: what mathematical catastroph-
es: what tropes: the jump cut from phenomenology to mathesis, suturing the
subject for whom the book is written, the writing of explanation and
description and the problematic situating both, the fold catastrophe as
that leap which creates structural extension, boundary, moving-on

virtual subjectivity and its relation to protocols, the imaginary, and
linguistic performativity. but which protocols: whose imaginary against
what inscription and whose thetic: but what languages and what mechanisms
of performance/perforation: who is speaking for whom across avatars, first
through other persons and tenses, what insistence carries the projection
and project of consciousness across real and virtual networks, what of
consciousness as such project, what of the peripheral imaginary, the
imaginary always already at a loss against or through the symbolic, what
of the symbolic as always already foreclosing, what of the toppling of the
scheme of things, what of alterities, multiculturalisms, sloughs, symbolic
emissions and spews, flows, the flooding of clutter and part-objects

the entrapment and proliferation of detail in a partially-cooled universe
between plasma and annihilation. but which inscription and which seal:  
but what decade and what millennium: but what substrate and cosmological
constant: and what of the sweeping away of the diachronic, necessary for
the therapeutic or functioning of the organism within this space, this
imminency, annihilation at the limit taken to the level of the absurd-
catastrophic, debris

the orders and relationships among communication, communality, and sexual-
ity. but what mind lost among them: what sado-masochistic part-objects
modeling the contractual contrast of the world, who are the communities
that assemble consciousness out of linkages and couplings, out of contigu-
ities and contingencies, what are the mathematics that operate within
these fields such that the addition of a term in a chain may or may not
affect that chain, and the withdrawal of a term in a chain may or may not
transform the topology

fragility and specificity of operability and the human. but what goodness:  
but what taxonomies of errors, mistakes, phenomenologies of corrupted or
failed teleologies, what judgments, what ethos: the constant collapse in
the face of catastrophe, beginning and ending with ground zero, the null
of physics politicized, culturalized, as the embedding of the focal-point
within the aegis of any project of the subject

propositional logics and the elsewhere of the sheffer stroke and its dual.
but whose withdrawal of the not-both-a-and-b, whose banishment of neither-
a-nor-b: what of the stroke itself engendered as | in relation to the dual
v, the stroke retaining the dissemination of division, the dual tending
towards the problematic of the scapegoat and expulsion

doubt and deconstruction of conclusions. but whose doubt against what
standards and relativisms: what auguries of truth and denial: what obses-
sional neuroses: what ignorance, incoherencies: the autobiography of the
leap, short-circuiting or short-cutting ignorance, as if something could
be made out of whole cloth, there are always strategies of apology,
implications of humility, everything in the way, no clarity towards its
absence

the scientific as that methodology among others, in spite of heuristic
breakdowns and the problematic of mathematics. what crystalline mechanism
inherent of the tractatus-logico-philosophicus, what neoplatonism, what
conventions, inscriptive labor: retaining the last vestige of ontology,
giving existence a nearly-decomposable structure from groundwork to
lifeworld, superstructure disconnections, proliferations of objects,
elements, particles, things, organisms, universal constructs of contrasts
and boundaries, boundaries maintenance, the general economy of inscription

the topology of intention and neurality in relation to externalized mind
and memory. but what privilege of data-banks, whose computers, whose
optical fiber, whose skein of satellites, what membranes and firewalls,
whose hackings and what penetrations: the future of networkings among
multi-taskings, virtual realities, information wars, incandescent sexual
hysterias, thickened communalities, and the relationships among these and
other futures vis-a-vis theoretical abstraction and general accounts of
cultural and universal creation

partial-objects and partial-mappings as givens in the construction and
reconstruction of the world. but of the gathering of accumulations and
assemblage of fragments, of the clutter and a-historicity of the world:
the disappearance of history, resonance of ideological tendencies among
historiographies, irrelevance of historical and theoretical recuperation,
the loss of the world among the world

the use of cases, examples, anecdotality, perceptual modes, in relation to
theoretical abstraction. what stories hidden with failures, ridden with
failures, gaps in texts, hiatus, ignorance: what negations (there are
none): what tales (they're all fiction): what parables (pretense!): and in
relation to the audience, what demographics following what core phenomena,
core metaphors, what one might tell you of an evening in miami with grack-
les scrabbling among scraps of food already evincing a symbolic construc-
ted among all of us in crude parody of heisenbergian sheffer-stroke quasi-
analytical approaches, as if the natural world were no longer problematic
but a gift towards the understanding

exhaustion, defuge, and the wavering of existence in terms of the physical
well-being of the body, as well as the deconstruction of that well-being.
but what disease of the writer, what writing-disease: what textual wound-
ing: what ending to what written world: what semantics, what syntactic
endings: from indo-european to the absence of the subject in the sentence,
the absence of the eye and the shifter, the winding up of the winding-
sheet and loosening of the world from language in relation to or in spite
of natural kinds, rigid designators, performatives, proper names, who are
alan sondheim, daishin nikuko, who are julu-jennifer

what writing: what loss of writing to the world: such presumption that
continuous production becomes closer to the thing, defines it, the "thing"
or "it" or production, that the model of labor creates and forecloses
among entities, that divisions and boundary phenomenology are somehow
riddled with existence

that of or within existence

book. fourth go at it.


the relationship of consciousness to the world vis-a-vis structure,
abstraction, symbolic systems. but the relationship of consciousness to
its inscription: who is inscribing: veering back from the concern, blind
ambition (see anecdotal) tending towards theoretical thwarting, return of
the repressed - immersive and definable structures which are negotiations
- irreversible or reversible - hierarchy of such structures - sets and
arrows - categories - the implicate orderings of consciousness within all
of this -

the quasi-logical structure of the lifeworld. but which lifeworld, which
state of confusion, which state of health: consideration of obsessional
neurosis as the holding-forth of the world, radical deposition - the
continuous need to inscribe, reinscribe - territorializations and assign-
ations - not the theoretics of doubt but the analytic inability to take
anything for granted -

the potential for philosophical investigation through audio-visual and
other media. but what style, what genre: whose investigation, what gender,
what methodology, what deployment of desire: questions of periodization,

but the chaotic debris of the body - extensions of flesh - subtexting in
which the dissolution of language is paramount, and always the problematic

consciousness in relation to subjectivity. but what consciousness: what
eidetic reduction: what cognitive mappings: what mathematical catastroph-
es: what tropes: the jump cut from phenomenology to mathesis, suturing the
subject for whom the book is written, the writing of explanation and
description and the problematic situating both, the cusp catastrophe as
that leap which creates structural extension, boundary, moving-on - the
fold, leaping into the fold, the relationship of the fold catastrophe to
the sheffer stroke and its dual - elsewhere of not-both-a-and-b tending

be made out of whole cloth, there are always strategies of apology,

book. the fifth go at it.


the relationship of consciousness to the world vis-a-vis structure,
abstraction, symbolic systems. but the relationship of consciousness to
its inscription: who is inscribing: veering back from the concern, blind
ambition (see anecdotal) tending towards theoretical thwarting, return of
the repressed - immersive and definable structures which are negotiations
- irreversible or reversible - hierarchy of such structures - sets and
arrows - categories - the implicate orderings of consciousness within all
of this - untended: unintended consciousness: my work is already an es-
cape, already unfounded: the phenomenological investigation of this rela-
tionship requires a certain sensitivity: i have granted myself this: fol-
lowing thought into harder structures: following structures into their
languor or lassitude:

the quasi-logical structure of the lifeworld. but which lifeworld, which
state of confusion, which state of health: consideration of obsessional
neurosis as the holding-forth of the world, radical deposition - the
continuous need to inscribe, reinscribe - territorializations and assign-
ations - not the theoretics of doubt but the analytic inability to take
anything for granted - exhaustion as a condition for the constant recon-
struction of the world: thinking of the play or theatrics of the world:
methodologies of distancing and absorption:

the potential for philosophical investigation through audio-visual and
other media. but what style, what genre: whose investigation, what gender,
what methodology, what deployment of desire: questions of periodization,
extension of media on a continuous feed-forward basis, inextricably tied
down to corporate research and development programs - weakening of them-
atic thinking - the need to organization meta-methodologies of search /
knowledge strategies - on the other hand the loosening of semantics
through the muteness of audio-visual representations - what one might call
"kidding ourselves" through the semblance of research: that's all there
might be to it: a certain carelessness of thought: fudging, the kludge or
glitch: loss of rigor: one might speculate that even the theorization of
such loss constitutes a defensive fortification against theorization
itself:

the natural order of structure. but what nature: whose nature: whose
cooperation: whose corporation: but what contractuality: the natural world
under the sign of capital, in-corporation, em/bodiment of nature, the body
politic, political body, structure transformed into performance, action -
but the chaotic debris of the body - extensions of flesh - subtexting in
which the dissolution of language is paramount, and always the problematic
of the symbolic - what is the binding of standing-in-for if not already
allegory, sign, inscription, intention - think of the bound body as al-
ready the hieroglyph and its politicization, the restraint of the symbol-
ic: arousal, tumescence, distension, stretched or opened skin: upwelling
of debris and frisson, shuddering, stuttering, trembling of the subject:

consciousness in relation to subjectivity. but what consciousness: what
eidetic reduction: what cognitive mappings: what mathematical catastroph-
es: what tropes: the jump cut from phenomenology to mathesis, suturing the
subject for whom the book is written, the writing of explanation and
description and the problematic situating both, the cusp catastrophe as
that leap which creates structural extension, boundary, moving-on - the
fold, leaping into the fold, the relationship of the fold catastrophe to
the sheffer stroke and its dual - elsewhere of not-both-a-and-b tending
towards the nomadic, exhaustion - the exhaustion of "the species" or "the
organism" - planetary exhaustion, universal denouement - already present
in the specter of death - wandering in the dual - neither-a-nor-b - it is
as if it splits: neither one nor the other: then there is the proboscis or
exploratory thesis: we have escaped the monadology:

inserted into enumeration: unaccountable and unaccounted-for: "there's no
telling" of the soul: "there's no telling" of the eye: there's no future
but hunger: no future but the desire or commitment to one or an/other:

virtual subjectivity and its relation to protocols, the imaginary, and
linguistic performativity. but which protocols: whose imaginary against
what inscription and whose thetic: but what languages and what mechanisms
of performance/perforation: who is speaking for whom across avatars, first
through other persons and tenses, what insistence carries the projection
and project of consciousness across real and virtual networks, what of
consciousness as such project, what of the peripheral imaginary, the
imaginary always already at a loss against or through the symbolic, what
of the symbolic as always already foreclosing, what of the toppling of the
scheme of things, what of alterities, multiculturalisms, sloughs, symbolic
emissions and spews, flows, the flooding of clutter and part-objects -
spoken within or spoken-for by avatars - consciousness as dialectic among
semantic emissions among subjects only some of which seem real - there are

insertion of flesh or electronic diegesis - moving among cyborgs - all of
us caught in virtual realities - the keywords absent, unknown - we exhaust
ourselves avoiding death and its already equally exhausted aporia - we're
drawn in and out of it -

we're speaking as if we're spoken-for: we're spoken-for as if we're speak-
ing: imagine a speech bypassing to such an extent that it occupies another
stratum entirely: that it appears to come from elsewhere: from neither-a-
nor-b: that it is one with aurality:

the entrapment and proliferation of detail in a partially-cooled universe
between plasma and annihilation. but which inscription and which seal:  
but what decade and what millennium: but what substrate and cosmological
constant: and what of the sweeping away of the diachronic, necessary for
the therapeutic or functioning of the organism within this space, this
imminency, annihilation at the limit taken to the level of the absurd-
catastrophic, debris - we're huddled in relation to our own demise - we
can smell the fear of it - the phenomenology of scent - nowhere and
everywhere at once - the smell of a person indeterminate, unidentifiable,
seductive - the procuring of death - writing and writing against it - the
continuous evolution of writing into and out of it - writing oneself into
existence - writing oneself out of it -

the scent bringing us back: the scent of the w/hole, anal musk: the scent
of the cauterization of philosophy: the anal fissure - not the inscription
of a / not-a, but the fissure of the same among/within the same: substance
fissures, structure breaks at inscription:

the scent of abjection, falling-apart: the body bound, held taut against
or within the generation of the hieroglyph: substance into structure
through the release of no-thought: desire: glyph:

the orders and relationships among communication, communality, and sexual-
ity. but what mind lost among them: what sado-masochistic part-objects
modeling the contractual contrast of the world, who are the communities
that assemble consciousness out of linkages and couplings, out of contigu-
ities and contingencies, what are the mathematics that operate within
these fields such that the addition of a term in a chain may or may not
affect that chain, and the withdrawal of a term in a chain may or may not
transform the topology - what is the lure of a masochism in which all
theoretics are abandoned - the organism at the limit of its existence - "i
am still alive" - the shell or hull of the organism - the universal
condition - but the rupture from everyday life: but the return: it is at
the juncture that the contract is enacted: that use becomes exchange: the
incipient or implicit or implicate or emergent quality of the signi- fier:
the word just beginning as the bonds are released:

fragility and specificity of operability and the human. but what goodness:  
but what taxonomies of errors, mistakes, phenomenologies of corrupted or
failed teleologies, what judgments, what ethos: the constant collapse in
the face of catastrophe, beginning and ending with ground zero, the null

mation within and without the subject - think of the skein or membrane of
the subject, subjectivity - network subjectivity, subjective networking -
embedded survival - "i am still alive" - "i" turns against itself: is
turned: is shredded: cannot turn: loses "its" domain: fissures: it is here

a-nor-b: what of the stroke itself engendered as | in relation to the dual

writing of/by the automaton - the writing of the tape-recorder: imagine
such without tape: it is the machine which is speaking: it is speaking
through us: it is a far cry from the turing machine: turing's cry:

doubt and deconstruction of conclusions. but whose doubt against what
standards and relativisms: what auguries of truth and denial: what obses-
sional neuroses: what ignorance, incoherencies: the autobiography of the
leap, short-circuiting or short-cutting ignorance, as if something could

"such that it or that is the case": there is always the case that one does

general case:
