<They constructed a world of meaning. they hysterically held onto it.>
this world smears meaning all over the place. everywhere we look we drib-
ble meaning. we let it hang limp from treebranches and sometimes it pools
on puddledgrounds. meaning seems to be an industry which spews forth all
sorts of things. they're called things because they mean. this world can't
tell the difference. oh, and another thing, this meaning stuff won't last
forever. it's a window which will be forgotten when the plasma comes. or
the plasma's here or on the way, but there are pockets of meaning in the
universe and they'll suppurate until it cools down too much for them. then
there won't be any energy, and even the fossils of meaning, inscriptions
and patterns having no relationship to crystallization, say, will disap-
pear. it will just go on like that, but we won't be around because if we
were, we'd still be smearing meaning all over the places, as i said. then
i wouldn't be able to say anything. i think that time would probably stop
and things would bump into each other, but not enough to make much heat,
and it would be that way until they wouldn't bump any more because they'd
be too far apart, or maybe they would bump less and less but there would
always be a chance.
