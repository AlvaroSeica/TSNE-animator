wan





this thing will take the day off from wryting herself into her mouth for

you to hear her speaking because

this thing is wan

with languor and lassitude and the need of smelling salts

and a headache-ing not with lust or desire but with the faintest caress

across lips and valleys tumultuous waterfalls hillocks and swelling

swellings of glands possibilities of fevers

  blessed nikuko soothes my eyes

  blessed alan wipes my brows

  blessed julu tenders her loving hands

  blessed jennifer smiles so sweetly

archangels of arche-writing across the text-ture of skin stretched

feverishly

with aspirin bringing the thermometer into the range of eyes watered

with tears and inabilities to /flash/ focus /flush/

like there willn't be a text this evening this fine evening

  the four of us lay down together

  parallel lines

  any three of which make a river

  and a mouth to one side for the word 'word'

where we are, where the thing will take a word

among the four-folding

  into you-me-mono

you will not know aspirin



"It is in this respect that we speak to ourselves by ourselves [nous nous

parlons tout seuls], to the point where what we call an ego emerges, with

no guarantee against the possibility of its being, strictly speaking,

delirious" (Lacan.)
