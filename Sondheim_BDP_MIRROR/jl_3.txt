The News from Aix to Ghent


I was carrying a SECRET from ELEANOR to DEBORAH; DEBORAH would reward me
bountifully with ALCOHOL. I was addicted from the young age of FIVE; MAGIC
BREW kept me alive.

It was pouring as I passed through the BLACK FOREST on the way to the
CASTLE. Suddenly, I feel into a HUGE PIT of LP-MUD and MARSH-SWAMP.

SIR ETHELRED rode up to me; he and his STALWART MEN were hiding behind the
DARK OAK. Laughing, he does say: A SNITCH IN SLIME CRAVES WINE!

Thus was born the MURDEROUS PROVERB OF CYBERSPACE, and ALL THAT FOLLOWED,
FOLLOWED THEREAFTER.
