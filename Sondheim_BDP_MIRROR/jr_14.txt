The Infinite Breath of HTML 


As semantic markup language, HTML treats any text as flow - around tables,
images, across and down the page, no breaks or paragraph divisions. Any-
thing between < and > becomes potentially meta-level, interpretable, and
the use of <PRE> </PRE>, <BR>, <P> </P>, etc., creates impediments, dam-
ming the flood of symbols. The infinite breath is broken into accessible
units.

Think of Charles Olson or Robert Creeley, the Black Mountain poets with
their emphasis on breath and line, the page reflecting voice itself, in-
hale and exhale, stopping over puzzled segments of emotion, partially de-
termined by the length of breath and declamation.

Think of Aram Saroyan's early minimalist work or the situation of a sonnet
on a page, or even modernist gallery-spaces, with, say, Blinky Palermo's
paintings neat and holding the largely empty wall.

HTML avoids this with perfect infinite-breath, going on forever, a single
and singular line-turned-block, until intervention. It is the literal
breath of the machinic, without inflection. Theory becomes theory-subs-
tance, language turns into choked symbolic noise. 

Install for the rest of us, through double-parsing: machine and human in
perplexed agreement. Speech clocks.
