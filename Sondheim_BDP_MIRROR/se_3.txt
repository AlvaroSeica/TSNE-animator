Collapse-production

all over hell and back the collapse-production 
of the Centre Pompidu performance, I'm still
picking up the pieces reductio ad absurdam and
what appears in http://www.alansondheim.org/reduc.mp4
is just about the quick fix to the platform,
mobius twists to the spheres, alterations 
through 3d printer technology files, so that
the result is the presence of the American
government shutdown as fascist Republicans 
stop the succeeding of our stalwart Blues to
have equality and justice for all, but never
fear, someone's marching to stop the madness,
oh those fierce Republicans with their guns in
their mouths, come to Chicago and New York and
Nairobi and see what they can do





Lousy


My recent work has been lousy, repetitive, mediocre.
I go over the same grounds again and again as I attempt
to hold onto my sanity in a world of ultra-violence.
Any response I might have to this world is lost in the
symbolic, nothing is left, nothing left behind.
I see our move to Providence as exile from the edginess
of Brooklyn, for me the last locus of alternative
negation. I see myself going over the same musical
grounds, playing alone or with Azure, without the dark
energy of the dominant saxophone. And I see my own good
ideas already on the block and lost. I'm lousy with a 
mind corrosive with self-pity, drive, obsession, and an
easy way out. I watch the body close down: carpal-
tunnel, stretched muscles, tinnitus, insomnia, sweat,
difficult breathing, clumsiness, stress, confusion:
what's left forms the few notes of the shakuhachi. I
take note of everything; I'm drowning in my own 
mediocrity. My end-blow flute-playing is lousy, my 
theory drags out thinkers from before the wars, my 
virtual world work imitates itself and I'm lazy in 
terms of new programming, my writing's pretty much 
ignored for good reason, and I still write from the
outmoded positionings of the murmur and the scream. I'm
exhausted with theory, I haven't read nearly enough, I
take shortcuts, my lousy thinking infects everything,
turning to paranoia at the slightest provocation. 
There - you see - "slightest provocation" - a lousy
trite phrase, because my thinking short-circuits 
itself, comes up with nothing new but a fabricated 
lousy honest that's close to unhinged. I wish for 
something new, some catalyst - students perhaps or a
Festschrift (I dare dream!) - to bring me out of this
study in gray, but I've wished for such all my life,
and this kind of wish is never granted, or granted 
at best in retrospect - and certainly not for the 
kind of lousy work I do. I type and think through the
autonomous nervous system, as if my circuits were 
jolted by some sort of external machinery from the 
gods, content be damned. I write but it writes itself
and in this case, this writing, this thinking, these
virtual worlds, these video, these images, this music,
is lousy, lousy, lousy, lousy, lousy. An epitaph -
stupidly, in spite of himself, he kept trying. The 
rest of us knew enough to ignore the results. He was
his own worst result. He was lousy.

He was lousy because he took the easy way out, as if
there were laurels to collect, choices made for him.
He went with whatever fell the fastest. He kept
waiting for his life and work to turn around, for 
something to turn them around, for him. He thought
practice, not insight, makes perfect. His thought was
lousy too.

Joy of Music

http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/joyofmusic.mp3

Chris Diasparra, tenor sax
Alan Sondheim, electric saz

saw! say "sax, saz!"!

We hadn't played in a while. This is beautiful,
done on the spur of the moment with Chris' new
sax. Apologies for the slight under-recording;
we just set up and started in.



People and Sleeping

From Al Wilson I learned you have to tune your instruments 
carefully. From Vito Acconci I learned I wasn't an artist and to 
only look at masterpieces. From Laurie Anderson I learned I was 
an artist. From Clark Coolidge I learned that it was okay to go 
as far as possible, and then turn around and find out it's still 
safe. From I.A. Richards I learned I have talent. From Keith 
Waldrop I learned I was a real artist. Because I can't sleep, I 
count my breaths, read, write, shower, cry, masturbate, cuddle, 
type this, script, send email, imagine a great iron sphere, 
imagine four-dimensional projections, think about theory and 
aphorisms, take sleeping pills and melatonin, brush my hair. 
From Kathy Acker I learned never to take my chances with a 
hippy. From Dad I learned I was a wastrel and a nincompoop. From 
Jabes I learned the virtues of condensation. From Foofwa I 
learned the value of mastery and intense preparation. From Darcy 
Lange I learned the virtue of speed. From John Todd I learned 
how to write. From Azure Carter I learned most of all. From -- 
----- I learned betrayal and I won't betray. From Gerald Jones I 
learned the American way of bad dying. Because I can't sleep, 
I've learned the value of lists, the necessity of half-truths, 
the art of being quiet. But people have taught me nothing and I 
am awake in the middle of the night.

Next day: In the middle of the night I am a coward. In the 
middle of the night I rake over old stories, crash-land "on a 
constant basis." I woke and slept and woke and slept today. I 
lost and gained a career. Where are the shakuhachi's high notes? 
Nada, Azure, and I had an amazing Japanese dinner. I continue to 
pursue the recording with Azure's songs. Steve has the master 
for the instrumental. I write this useless paragraph as an 
epitaph to the one above, bringing narrative to a halt as I once 
again try to sleep in the nearby future.



Violaline

http://lounge.espdisk.com/archives/1212 (best)
http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/violaline.mp3

Modified Lamy violaline, late 19th century.
I've tuned four strings to ee aa - two unisons a fourth
apart; the unisons are played separately, allowing for
major and minor intervals of all sorts, a different
kind of chording. It reflects exactly the disruptions
in our lives as we prepare for leaving Brooklyn for
Providence, all sorts of things given away, the place
turned upside-down. The music is strange, as is the
instrument.





Pill


After I take the pill, I think to myself: 
I am free of the pill. I am not taking it NOW.

I sleep through the pill. Therefore it has no
effect. When I am awake, the pill has 
disappeared. Like me, it has no existence.

My short term memory is confused when I wake;
objects exchange positions and functions. I
know the pill has created this transformation.
The day later returns to normal, but I am 
unsure: Where did the exchange happen and 
when? Am I not disordered NOW?

The NOW is the immediacy of the reaction
which cancels all others. I hate it; I would
rather live without it, another one of my
endless regrets. The NOW contains the seeds
of misery and corrosion, and what happens
subsequently is a hideous version of Marx's
exchange value: How can one value anything,
when the world is flat, nauseous, and lost
in dull confusion?

Ten minutes after taking the pill: Freedom
awaits!

my palm bursts with embers



most of the people i see in this town live in this town. 
some of them have come to this town, they are in this 
town, i see them here, i am in this town. when she was
on top screwing me, the crucifix went in and out my
mouth, or in and out of my mouth. he said to her i was
a nuisance and said to me she was a nuisance. she left
her diary open on the table and it said screwing me was
like being with a rat but i was paying the way. i never
understood maoism or marxism in practice. the inerrancy
of any position produces a screwing machine and a 
killing machine. retribution is never an option. listen
and you must salvage the theoretical work in the middle
of all of this. she gave all of us worms and said when
you sleep with hippies you take your chances. i had to
stay with him after the killer junkie went scratching 
at his door. should i have written in the midst of. am
i now in the midst of my life or, duree duree, does 
that depend on how near to the end i might be. what is
called the further end. she wanted to be a cockroach
on my wall and then future culture would have been
different. i remember jerusalem. my life of bad
behavior, the regret of use and abuse. my life of good
behavior, the regret of used and abused. but i was 
always under suspicion, tainted. i have always been
unacceptable but i was paving the way. all of our 
dirty little secrets are all of us all of the time.
this was going to be a story but catapulted. in the 
town there are people and to get from the city to the
town i must not miss a step. the body in translation 
is as near to continuity as any other, as possibility
or potential. the jump cut comes in the text bending
any moment into an other but in the read the bending
entangles and the jump cut smears across semantics or
a form of semantic lounging. i stayed with al and the
junkie left, but not before leaving shit everywhere in
the hall, off to do another killing.


HOLD ON!


Hold on right there!

One second!

Hi! What's your name?

Well, Sick of Tricks and Repetition, let's get started! Let's
make a gender! That ok with you?

Oh well, let's get going!

What do you want to call this thing you're making?

Well, we're breathless; give us some adjectives!

Let lt !  = assassinate q=B0T=wounded~=BD=E8=AEt= mo "healed

Well, -mistreat-molest-mortal-wound-mutilate-chilblain-blow-

subverting the categories we take for granted. Beyond the

theory responsive will and willing, malady and sickness work
with that one; but it's the illness; i'm sick written under
illness with codeine surrounded by t your death, give a name to
your illness smi your wound. You are sick of existence. You
don't want to be annihilated. | | | | wound ?  ?  ?  ?  wound




Why Writing on the Move

Why writing on the move?
It's the thinnest mode of transmission, perhaps lower ascii
one of the thinnest of all, given the providence of low
code requirements - that is to say for example that the old
Morse dot-dash translates into letter and then the rest
follows - that is to say, most likely following Eco, a double
encoding.

So that it can occur on the run, so that it moves path-wise
from internals to externals and then to the world and its
noisy semiological theoretics. But the first stage, that of
the writing while, for example, I'm attempting to sleep or
shuddering yet again at the end of a difficult day - the 
first stage, like Speer on his walks, is an anywhere event,
providing of course any pain, physical or otherwise, is 
sufficiently dull or somnolent to permit a field of thought
and thought's operations, entangled, at play.

So that it requires very little apparatus, as if speech
itself would do, in the absence of any other technology
pursuant to speech's preservation, or at least the gist of
speech, minus the acrobatics of emotion or voice or tonal
structure.

I think of this as the bringing-up of speech during the 
move, or the movement of speech, bringing up the world
and its inhabitation.

And something which does not require an occasion, such as
this.
