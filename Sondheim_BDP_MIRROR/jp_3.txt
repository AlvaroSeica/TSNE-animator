HYMEN CLASH


We were trying to write a collaborative piece about subjectivity and
sexuality, illness and masochism. But as we began developing our dialogue
through electronic mail, we found ourselves taking up sexualized positions
within the discourse, such that our original issues were lost in issues of
control over the text.

We attempted a text dealing with masochism from the double viewpoint of
sexuality and chronic pain. Doors unlocked and locked; the resulting mas-
ochistic text satisfied no one. It fastens/fascinates.
