Final Notes On Slow Entry (HP 110 laptop) -

1. That cat slows down sufficiently at 300 baud - cat <file> spills a file
to the screen; at 300 baud, it's readable without using more or less. 

2. That raw telnet works with talkers reasonably well - the only real pro-
blem is that of the login-screen, or the .rev (review) command, which 
loads and replays the last 25 lines of dialog - takes quite a whle.

3. That Mail permits fairly rapid replies - Mail (Unix mail) works well, 
but insists on loading almost the entire header; replies are quick, how- 
ever.

4. I did manage to download, oddly enough, by using the vi <filename> com-
mand - it managed to make it onto the laptop for at least parts of files.
I imagine upload might work the same way. I had to turn off the HP 110's
protocols, however; it was raw ASCII. (I'd like to know more about this,
since some situations might not have x-y-z-modem/kermit available.)

5. Any program such as Pico that needs screen refreshing - or complex 
clients such as tiny fugue - just don't work properly; the key commands 
seem inoperable (no matter how they're set on the 110).

Why is this of interest? Because this is one of the narrowest bandwidths 
still possible; because it shows what might be done under relatively poor 
Net conditions; because it's a good way to learn fundamental Unix pro- 
grams, and because the relatively slow rate brings all sorts of things to 
the surface, believe it or not (particularly on talkers) that appear too 
quickly at current normal speeds to be read, or even noticed.
