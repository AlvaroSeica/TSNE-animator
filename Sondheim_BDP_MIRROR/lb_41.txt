of interior from exterior by the thin skin of glass, the cathode caught
this morning, morning's minion, and close to the bone, and my bones are
beyond, and there's always beyond:

now look! dry bones of the valley floor mind and body - but not really.
This is part of the hypocrisy of the work-mind, for whom every word is
precious and worthy of a public. Clearly, where - not the mouse, which was
the first thing that came to mind. Debris _this_ unfolding world and no
other. I would love my mind to play tricks: apparatus immediately comes to
mind - heavy electric motors, AC-DC, power-mind. Losing my mind to power:
finding it.
