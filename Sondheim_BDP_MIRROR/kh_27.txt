Parable: Resistances to Leaving


(Always I do leave one or another place, finding a home there; and always
where my home is, in the noise of the States, I think of finding a home.)

And always I do drag along with me
such things as reconstruct the land,
I am thinking of those numinous objects
which open the travesties of worlds -
what would be keepsakes or intensities,
conjured by the long red threading
back into their homeland, and I, I see
them as _them_ and the scuttling
of all the cats in the world and their prey,
and I resist leaving, and take
every memento, grasping at this image
and holding onto that stone, and now
the digital camera is loaded with eighty pictures
and now, it has become a tomb of truth
in the form of the elements earth, water, fire, wind, air
and I have a sumo chart and a soroban, and I have voices
that will never leave Daishin Nikuko alone, that accompany
her past the Net into the real world, and back again,
so that now I glimpse something when I read your words
and hear something when the sounds of a computer
run on and on quietly in the next room over -
as if these were simple things, foreclosing the complex,
creating clean neat surfaces you may scribble on,
these resistances to leaving in the form of a body losing flesh,
these crash-land nighttime skies giving way to the form of a poem.
