The reversal again: Where are the instructions for signing _on_ the list?
Surely not on the list, which must, at one point or another, have encoun-
tered, individual by individual,
subscribe cybermind firstname lastname -
so this and every other list must have a necessary leakage of course,
instructions given outside and before the fact, each and every fact
enunciated on the list.
Which within the list might be the only world there is.
Which is also related to purchasing an old edition of a book, desperate
for the newer bibliography updating the work.
Suddenly one is thrown from the book itself, foreclosed and immanent,
to the debris of scholastic/academic/popular studies - nowhere to turn,
nothing to look towards beyond, now, a hotbot or amazon.com or altavista
search.
Which is a search into the space of infomatics, and hopefully the future
of the older edition will be advertised there.
There is a conundrum here of course, rather easily solved, but nonetheless
related to Lyotard's differend, as well as the Terror.
