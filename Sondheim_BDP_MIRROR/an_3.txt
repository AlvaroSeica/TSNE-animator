Perfume


Two nights ago, working, I put perfume behind my ears, slightly around my
eyes, around my nose. The heavy and subtle smell lasted and lasted for
hours, so associated with body, pleasure, the glance of someone down the
street and the girl on the subway car; later the same night, sleeping, it
was as if all the you in the world were there beside me, and I would say
this, not wanting to sound so formal, but nonetheless - that my space was
reconfigured, blossoming with convexity and softness, the subtle thrill of
satin, hint of moisture in its crevices which remember infolding forever,
even past down into the harshness of the day. Such blossoming in the form
of voice and murmurs as well, softening my exterior as I slid into dreams
and memories rising like slow and tepid lava to the surface... The whole
night was such an ellipsis... no longer the point or node of the telephone
headset or computer screen, but everywhere, everywhere... So that there
were nothing to be said but the soft Joycean saying of it, this odor which
flowered, defined the real, this very real flowing...
