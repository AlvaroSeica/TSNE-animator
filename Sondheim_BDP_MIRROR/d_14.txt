Misrecognition: Disturbances of Third Sex





Lyotard, the fictional discovery of a manuscript, as reported in Pacific 

Wall, in which this occurs:



"It's precisely - to use the American phrase - off limits. Look: this 

center is the true nomad. The center is actually migratory because all 

cultures come here and exchange their movement quantities - lose them- 

selves. So come. Come and pillage that migratory movement. Come and carry 

off its real power."



To _whom_ this is addressed, and the lateral subject of the text, remains 

for another day. The passage I present is reconstituted from the French, 

a minor-key, flattened affect, and judging by the date of the Wall, per- 

haps even a reference to Anti-Oedipus. But I say:



It is the subject that is the center, and it is the subject that is off-

limits. And for the center, Jerusalem, to wander, well then the boundar-

ies themselves are thrown off, although one might imagine for example an 

ellipse or further distorted figure with a region of wandering centers.



Apart from the wandering centers, there is language, lost and simultane- 

ously describing movement. And it is language which as the key to the un- 

conscious, recuperated this text for me in an/other/'s, or why _this_ is 

being written, uneasy thetic lost in the midst of chaotic trajectories:



I speak of the speaking of cybersex, from experiences where language is

lost through its presence; what appears metaphorically is _chora_ at best,

region of clashing drives. Cybersex can overwhelm, overcome, the body left

to the other's devices. And it is this that, I argue, creates a _third

sex,_ beyond masturbation or visible partners, a third sex based on the

language of the unconscious returning, creating within you a realm of

_uncanny desire,_ the distension of the other in the same, the collapse of

the Irigarayan self/other/self into other/self/other. For if the un-

conscious speaks, it questions the _possession_ of this unconscious: Who

is it that speaks me through the screen, if not my other/self? Ravish-

ment here is always already unravelling of Borromean _nots_ held together

by the last vestiges of the erased subject. I am sure about this. 



In cybersex your desire is spoken _by the other_ becoming your desire; 

what returns is desire-being-spoken-for, a position of masochism, splay

and display, no matter what the guise. Obdurate matter returns in mean-

ing's annihilation, rows of letters hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhx signalling orgasm

as the hand operates gesturally (Tran Duc Thao begins the beginning of

language precisely in gestures - but _this_ gesture is blocked, returning

the body at its limits as well.)



If in first or second sex, the _you_ disappears, in cybersex, the _your_ 

disappears as the body is parcelled out through torn sexuality. The text, 

languaging: We are so used to it! It cuts like a microtome, removing 

tissue structures holding everything together, the big ball with holes. 

We hardly know what's happening to us!



And what about this loss of _your_? This isn't the ordinary little-ego

boundary bye-bye teased out by liquid physiology; this is tied, bound, to

the text, the _your_ taken from you, ingested in the mouth of the _other,_

spat out - there's nothing to hope for! 



Lyotard's text continues through politics, backwards and forwards, but a

woman might well desecrate: "Come and carry off its real power. Act like

white women. Pretend to be white skin." Third sex is skinned sex, text

skinned as well. No longer reading/being read, the terminal _mouths the

body,_ inscribes the neural musculature directly. The ideology of domina-

tion, the uneasy politics of "normative" sexualities, races, ages, and

genders, do not disappear; they are a _secondary your_ that in fact also

is taken from you. (If the first _your_ is related to a primary narciss-

ism, the second is related to secondary narcissism, cultural trajectories

close on by disappearance.)



Once you find out you don't know who you are you can't return to the sec-

urity of knowledge whatever.
