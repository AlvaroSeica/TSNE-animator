Kids Say the Darndest Things!


Hi Dad!
Want to come to school with me?
Can I have some cereal?
These toys are cool!
Look what I can do!
Can I have that?
Where did Mom go this afternoon?
What's that?
Good night!
Dad, I can't sleep!
Okay.
Where are we going?
Look what I wrote in school!
My room looks okay I guess.
Thanks!
Do we have to?
It's hot out!
