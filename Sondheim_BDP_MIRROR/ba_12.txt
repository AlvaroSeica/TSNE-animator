Kneed


Everything is always _placed_ in the past. I need _you_ for my future. I
need the dominion of the square of the land. I need protection of the
sharpness of the corners, sliced edges. I have more needs than you can
imagine. I need _you_ here and now and forever. We _need_ to violate the
present. We _need_ to cordon off the present. We _need_ its isolation and
its sustenance. 

But I put the text away. But I put the text _to bed._ But I come to you
refreshed. But I come naked and hairless, my penis _jutting out._ But I'm
all new and wet and shiny. 

Although I won't be for long. Although the world is coming to an end. Al- 
though there's no more room for us. Although there's nothing left for us.

However there will be others lalala. However they'll be sitting in this
room lalala. However they'll be talking about new news. However it will
not be our news. However it will not be our world. 

They'll be talking about us. They'll get everything wrong. They'll move on
to other subjects. They'll get lost in the past. They'll be in the past
tense. They'll be past tension. I need _you_ to forget them. I need _you_
to forge the new news. I need _you_ to _stay_ with me. My _needs_ are
enormous.
