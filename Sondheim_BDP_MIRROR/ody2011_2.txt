[13:35] sandy Taifun: i was thinking last night that the performance at 
brown was our best in many ways - because we projected both of our screens

[13:36] sandy Taifun: You begin to understand that not all avatars are 
bots or expert systems that some of them are symptoms just as I am

[13:36] sandy Taifun: natyasatrotpatti: mythical origin of the work

[13:36] sandy Taifun: Well, there's no more to it, and his writing avatar 
discourse itself is getting stale. He's taken you and I around the bend
