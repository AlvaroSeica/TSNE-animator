The Infinite Post


A simple example of an infinite self-reflexive sentence: 

The first word in this sentence has three letters and the second word has
five letters and the third word has four letters ... 

In terms of syntax:

The first word in this sentence is an article and the second is an 
adjective and the third is a noun...

Both of these are relatively simple, self-generating.

One can nest levels as well:

The first word here is "the" and the second is "first" and the third is 
"word" and the fourth is "here" and the fifth is "is" and the sixth is 
'"the"' ...

Although first two above owe something to Bory, they're not of particular 
interest except as a now moribund conceptualism. But there is one scheme 
that has been fascinating me since I discovered it:

The last word in this sentence has seven letters and the next to last 
word has five letters and the next to next to last word has three 
letters   [...]   has three letters.

Now the _last_ three words refer to the first word, "The," everything wor-
king backwards, and in fact, both the ending and beginning of this monster
can be determined to any degree of precision. The ending is an infinitely
distant memory of the beginning of course; the order is that of the infin-
ity of the integers. So this is an infinity with clear boundaries, hover-
ing around, but not quite penetrating, the transfinite. I don't believe
there's a paradox here, but the sentence amazes me. 

Alan - and please don't attempt to send any of the above in full to the 
Net; you'd bring everything to a halt...
