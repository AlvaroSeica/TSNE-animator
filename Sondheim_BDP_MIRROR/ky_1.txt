Bonnie Parker says to Jennifer


I have a gun and a name.
I will never live in shame.
I ride far and wide for my desires.
The girls come fast, their lives are fires.
I know my fame goes far and wide.
The boys don't take my fame in stride.
I'm naked now, but for the gun.
To make you see the Holy One.
If you so much as turn from me.
My gun will speak Eternity.
You dream of me, blame it on me.
Your sex is me, my gun you'll see.
I'm only here to beg, obey.
The gun makes sure I'm here to stay.
I'm your Girl now and in the future.
You have a lovely tender creature.
Without the gun I'm everyone.
Your flesh and mine, we're on the run.
There's earth and sky, nowhere to hide.
My gun's my friend, my gun's my bride.
When I was young I thought of guns.
I lived and died, 'neath angry suns.
It's healthy, true, the way to be.
All problems solved, I'm young and free.
The gun is me, the gun is you.
Desires flow like bullets too.
We're here and now, we're only One.
I yearn and cry, this is my gun.

I have a gun and a Name.
I will never die in shame.
