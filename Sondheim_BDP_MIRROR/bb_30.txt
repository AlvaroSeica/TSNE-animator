Happy days are again! Everyone is full of joy!
I jump up in Brooklyn, clicking heel in pure air!
But wait! I need to travel to foreign country!
I look up and down my block! I am so shy I look my feet!
Happy feet! Are here again! They jump me up!

But wait! I write you this Hello! It is Just Like Visit!
To You I am Just Like Visit! Hello! Finland! Spain!
Do you want to be my country! 
Hello!

Now I sit here and wait for you Hello!

Alan! Hi!
