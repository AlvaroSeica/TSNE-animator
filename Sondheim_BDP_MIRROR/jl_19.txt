I'm somewhat pessimistic concerning the efficacy of even partial retooling
of any number of local economies for infomatics functions. This amounts to
a movement from agricultural/industrial trajectories to information soc-
iety, which may make the region vulnerable and its proffered services out-
dated or redundant. At this point in time, there are reasons to be optim-
istic for a limited number of regions, however; many of the service areas
above need to be addressed, and local regions can outbid more centralized
metropolitan areas. 

In the long run, I think one of the main uses of CMC in non-metropolitan
areas will be for the intensification and presentation of local culture
(hopefully with only a limited degree of packaging and reification); a
means for dispersed families and communities to remain closely in touch;
and a means for the intensive distribution of local (and even national/
professional) information to those who need it most.
