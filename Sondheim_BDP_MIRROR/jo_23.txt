Video-Jennifer


Video-Jennifer is completed, a half-hour long, noise reduction up full,
soft or auto-focus a good deal of the time; the result is a continuous
milkiness, paralleled by the sound. The series of rephotographed screens
within screens creates, not layerings of representation, but framing de- 
vices situating her within the machine; very occasionally she breaks out
in TAZ-discussion, for example, the temporary autonomous zone, as if she
were a literal moment in some crazed transcendent metaphysics.

Video-Jennifer in panties, speaking in a man's voice, neither transvestite
nor transsexual, her skin hugging to my own in the form of apparel, Alan-
Jennifer pushing towards borderline psychosis. Video-Jennifer whimpering
for doctor, cancelling herself out, crossed by numinous self-reference;
there are always moments when another seems to appear, only to resubmerge
in breast-penis, liquid, the exacting enumeration of the skeletal appara-
tus of TCP/IP beneath the surface.

She speaks and speaks, doubles her speech; at the end doesn't everyone
realize that the voice appears solely from the interior of the body, that
expulsion carries the memory of blood?
