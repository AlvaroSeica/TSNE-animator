none of it is bad of course, but it's frustrating; I'm greedy, I think a
lot of us are, I want it all: I want to know how things will emerge, and
then how they will emerge after that, and after that...

and with Azure, to be sure, it's a thing that is always there, that my
death will almost definitely precede her by decades; for me this is an odd
emotional and inconsolable state, a broken future; I think to myself,
always, _I won't know, I won't know_ ...
