Parable of questions


How many parables? How many stories miniaturized as if there edification
along the traderoute from Japan to America, crossing the deserts and
mountains of the globe? How great the depth of false wisdom's saturation,
the motivation of lies - each parable branded against the others, the
whole held together by a skein of mucilage and damaged life? How much
longer the writing which curls against itself as skin is heated, almost to
the breaking-point? How much longer these questions, proverbial warnings,
curled reflections on absence, Nikuko's throbbing and aggressive sex? I,
Daishin Nikuko, am tired of the truth! Do you understand, I am tired of
the truth! Tired of it. Tired of it.

I will write lies. I will fill the world with lies. I will join the world
from the bridge of my nose to the soles of my feet. I will press valleys
and oceans against my body. I will write with blood from my body, spit
from my mouth, piss and shit from my holes, fragments of skin and gristle
under my fingernails. My nails are dark with other organs. My nails are
dark with other organs. 

I cry lalala into the wilderness! I lie in the wilderness! I cry lalala!
I cry lalala!

Lalala, I am living you! Lalala, I am living you!
