There appears to be some writing on the note ...

  Is this whatever truth there is?
  Because I wonder what the biz is.
  Or if the biz is biz.
  And who are you to gain the plane
  Which has taken off (your clothes)
  Leaving you plain and in pain
  And nothing left you suppose
  To your brain but a stain
  When there is nothing to gain
  Here hexed by text
  Nothing more before
  Nothing left to store
  My Poem by Julu              [this is bright new text]


aural-phone, uterine tendrils, extrusions, circulations of internal fluids
striations, lamina, internal of Tiffany, external of alan, it is closed
language a dark space of annotations, unreadable, the dinner readied by
the male, trapped, a web-inversion, violation, fabric: He sees: a lance
impaled on an endless plain of skin wholed with Tiffanyalan or leftoral 
skin, rimmed with Tiffanyalan               [this is dead old text]
