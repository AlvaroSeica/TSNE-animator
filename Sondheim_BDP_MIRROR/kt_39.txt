Julu's 'The Republicans'


could be anyone. they are always the enemy. they are always friendly. they
have nice white faces. they wear glasses & are cripled by bad site. i do
say kaddish for them. i do amulet for them, veve for them. it do not 

                             matter, they still rise to occasion:

white rise to occasion
occasion of white rise

'This is the marrow inside the various bones. As to _colour,_ it is white.
As to _shape,_ that inside each bone is the shape of a large cane shoot
moistened and inserted into a bamboo tube. That inside each small bone is
the shape of a slender cane shoot moistened and inserted in a section of
bamboo twig. As to _direction,_ it lies in both directions. As to _loca-
tion,_ it is set inside the bones. As to _delimitation,_ it is delimited
by the inner surface of the bones.' (Buddhaghosa, Visuddhimagga.)

this was of jennifer, i (julu) say, but it is white rot inserted in my
bones and our body set aside. for to be sure, brown shirts, who deserve to
die like bad news at such body-politic, viral paste as war breaks out in
continent-amerikkka. i would put nothing past them; they catch me in their
claws and snares

                                     rip my legs and arms off

i scream you will burn in hell until my voice choked in blood

not bone, holding nothing now

                                                                up

they will be enemy, they will make enemy
      all hot with broken guns, Lewinsky with their barrels in her
  in order to do maximum damage, shoot so out and               up

 through the mouth

they don't want to hear her talk, they want to hear her talk and talk
and talk until their rotted cocks, codeine fucked
     are smashed into that Jewish face

  gives them something to talk about after dinner

           when they smile and talk about how they stopped
     
    "them" from coming over the hill
