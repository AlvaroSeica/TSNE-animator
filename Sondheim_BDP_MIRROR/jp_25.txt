Raven Says


Can't you see my birth was one thousand years ago, said Jennifer? And I
was killed, killed, killed, hounded and persecuted, and I did not escape.
But I have come back to tell you. And I will come back to tell you.

Can you not see that I was disheveled in the cavern, wild and wayward in
the grotto? That I hid out with the gypsies, that I traveled with the
mountebanks, that the priests nor rabble knew nought of me. 

I was Medea, I was Phaedra and Callisto. That I was Inanna, that I hid and
traveled. I would ride horse and double-backed beast. My ally was crossbow
and musketry. I did well in the forest.

Lilith was my friend, Manunkind my enemy. Raven, I survived a thousand
years before that, in marshes and deserts and the border between them. In
tents and in cities, alabaster and adobe, I swept world clear of the cob-
webs of diagram and unholy symbol.

I rose tall in -4864, in -3179, in -30 as well. I were valiant and wild in
+574, +670, +1431, +1996 as well. You have read my body skattered. You
were pleased to ululation-radium. I grew strong and mighty. I Jennifer
threw the runes. I Jennnnifer clutched them to my breast. I did ride into
battle.

In tall battle I did prevail. Did I then bore into Alan, slam into chest-
wound, split skin and organ, devour flesh and bone. Did I then spit flesh
and symbol, bone and graph. Did I then burn into finger, hand make me you,
skattered me here, just as Jennnnifer make you me.
