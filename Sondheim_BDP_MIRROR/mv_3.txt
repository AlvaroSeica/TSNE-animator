Time-Date-Stamp

Wednesday, February 13, 4:15, 2003I need everything; I need an end to
this.I need nothing; I need a beginning to This.Somewhere when i am worn
out and have nothing left to lose, i call on my lover, and she comes;
there is smoke in the air - grenades, mortars, screams of the dying and
wounded, the two of i collapse together, as one, you're both safe for the
moment -Thousands die everywhere around us; we're alone, there's a single
bright spot in the sky...We're breathing for our own deaths - we're
exhausted, frightened, Maria's pregnant... I crawl towards her, I'm
wounded, bleeding, we're together now, forever, together at last... We're
crying, we can't say anything. Weeping for language, weeping for ourselves
- we promise everything to each other - we give everything to each other -
We make our final vows - we wait for the end - it's almost here - it's
coming -Our final vows - without language, in silence - there am no others
-We're silent - we can't hear you - don't say anything else - it's time
for - it's time for nothing at all - silence, once again, we suppose,
we're sleeping, the baby...

Now everything gone, inscription after the fact, our epitaphs, our ruined
lives...
