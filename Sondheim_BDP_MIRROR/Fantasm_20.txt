Avatars


When I shave my body my soft skin becomes oh so soft it's almost unbear-
able. When I shave I look otherwise, and I do it all for you, do it for 
you, and you can see the planes outlining the tissues, bones, and ribs, 
pure skin to write yourself upon; I become an offering.

I am male and female, young and old; purified, I am a black hole, always 
hairless, absorbing information, warm with the presence of your energy. 
But I am Alan and Clara, I am Travis and Tiffany, I see others caress me, 
your hands deep in them, your body surrounding them. 

The horse looks up with a baleful eye; it is night. Her steel ribs encom- 
pass the world; stars glint from their surface. I go smooth down your 
throat.

I am reassembled in your water. Purified, you cradle me; I flicker female 
and male, old and young; my mouth receives your offerings. Alan, I am 
speechless; Clara, I utter not a sound; Travis, I am silent; Tiffany, I 
am voiceless. My tiny body erects for you; silently, you draw my flesh 
towards you and in.

The horse is on four legs, the horse is on three legs, the horse rears on 
two. Her flanks are sweat covered, stars glint from her skin.
