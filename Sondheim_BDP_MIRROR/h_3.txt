cool world.



the day is done. another cold onslaught freezes

like spoiled milk unlapped by some forgotten cat. o bomb,

bomb me! before I remember what liquid is, its untoward paths



slaving to drown each and every object of the world, mocking,



mocking them. liquid reminds itself, and through itself, us,

that everything returns to rust, ruin, or simply damp cloth

useless in drying emergencies. I confess I have not had

"them" for years; I threw the towel in, watching it cohere



to the surface of a locomotive. for the first time, I under-

stood, what steam "was," and just what that had to do

with shape.
