Artist: Robert Morris

Completion Date: 1961

Style: Minimalism, Conceptual Art

Genre: installation

As its title indicates, Morris's "Box with the Sound of Its Own 
Making" consists of an unadorned wooden cube, accompanied by a 
recording of the sounds produced during its construction. 
Lasting for three-and-a-half hours, the audio component of the 
piece denies the air of romantic mystery surrounding the 
creation of the art object, presenting it as a time-consuming 
and perhaps even tedious endeavor. In so doing, the piece also 
combines the resulting artwork with the process of artmaking, 
transferring the focus from one to the other. Fittingly, the 
first person in New York Morris invited to see the piece was 
John Cage-whose silent 1952 composition 4'33" is famously 
composed of the sounds heard in the background while it is being 
performed. Cage was reportedly transfixed by Box with the Sound 
of Its Own Making, as Morris later recalled: "When Cage came, I 
turned it on... and he wouldn't listen to me. He sat and 
listened to it for three hours and that was really impressive to 
me. He just sat there."

"Since I must save the day of tomorrow, since I must have a form 
because I don't feel strong enough to stay disorganized, since I 
inevitably must slice off the infinite monstrous meat and cut it 
into pieces the size of my mouth and the size of the vision of 
my eyes, since I'll inevitably succumb to the need for form that 
comes from my terror of remaining undelimited - then may I at 
least have the courage to let this shape form by itself like a 
scab that hardens by itself, like the fiery nebula that cools 
into earth. And may I have the courage to resist the temptation 
to invent a form." (Clarice Lispector, The Passion According to 
G.H., trans. Idra Novey, Penguin, 2012, p. 7)

these terms and my use of them are of course arbitrary; one 
might use encoding to reference the act of program-creation and 
coding that which operates on input, with all the phenomenology 
of input already indicated. I choose a distinction between these 
words in order to articulate a distinction within the field; 
otherwise we are off again into unnecessary obscurity. as for 
the element of a code, there is a sign or sign-function, there 
is a process drawn from tables or closed lexicons. as for the 
element of encoding, there is none; an input may, in relation to 
the encoding program, be fit (in the sense of harmonization) or 
not; in a sense it does not matter, as encoding is matterless, 
codeless, just as coding is mattered, albeit the ideality or 
cyberneticization of matter. inhalings, harmonics, harmonizings,

Story, Dream, Foundation


http://www.alansondheim.org/sdf.png


Framework for a story -

A group of characters, similar to rotifers, who have identical 
cells, postures, gender (there is only one), appearance, etc.; 
the story proceeds as the characters, drawn by differing events, 
behave differently, without any change whatsoever in their 
makeup, appearance, etc. The world is bent by the skein of 
identity, what happens?


From a dream -

A dream last night in which Azure and I were with my father 
(deceased) and brother and some other relatives (my brother's 
children?) in an airport; I went to bring something back (a 
drink? magazine? food?); and when I returned we began talking. 
While we talked there were two moments when the sound cut out 
completely, as if a speaker were disconnected; each moment 
lasted at best one or two seconds; when we were audible, when 
the world was audible again, I asked if the others had (not) 
heard the same; they did; I had a great terror; I said we must 
get out of here; we began leaving; I woke. What interruptions 
occur that pass unnoticed, that come from elsewhere, or appear 
to? What plots dissolve, bringing us along in their wake?



From Sappho in Loeb, translated Campbell - 


' Sappho to an uneducated woman: But when you die you will lie 
there, and afterwards there will never be any recollection of 
you or any longing for you since you have no share in the roses 
of Pieria; unseen in the house of Hades also, flown from our 
midst, you will go to and fro among the shadowy corpses. '

Azure points to a body region; Kira moves it.

i'm always trying to find a home away from illusion and 
misrecognition, somewhere i might be comfortable, with good 
friends, community. when i leave a place i'm always taking with 
me dozens of 'homeland' photographs, as if they can pull me back 
to a dwelling that will hold me and azure forever. i'm always 
failing at this as well, everything seems illusory and the world 
is far harsher than i could ever have imagined as a child, and 
as a child i had a picture of the hydrogen bomb by my bedside. 
it was scary but it was distant, it didn't gnaw from within. now 
the world seems colder, more violent, with great sadness and 
upheavals everywhere, i'm thinking of so many species plunging 
to extinctions, a planet which can only be described, now, as 
trashed, and the feeling that there is no place called home 
anymore. i can't live in illusion, grace and life itself are 
illusions, i'm teetering, can one fall into light, i don't know, 
i haven't heard of that but i'm listening, ear close to the 
ground, listening for the slightest signs, hoping against hope, 
that somewhere in the universe, for someone, something, is a 
dwelling place of eternal comfort, homeful and hopeful, if only 
a tiny place, a small hut, small community, something outside 
the illusions of the light of day.

archtectural beauty of banjo-in

http://www.alansondheim.org/banjo-in.png
http://www.alansondheim.org/banjo-in.mp3

banjo with pipa tuning, japanese in scale, improvisation

half-steps and major thirds are characteristic

melancholy sounds of a rough day, sanshin and garcia lorca

and what else i forget what else in the music 

forget bushido forget zen forget buddha

but i don't want to kill anyone and i want this banjo to survive

it is my desire it survive and its beautiful music survive

uncanny passing for another one hundred twenty eight years

formulaic condensation: most western dramaturgy emphasizes 
affect an effect: thus a panoply of effects and transformations, 
machinic virtuality. in my work, as in the natyasastra, i 
emphasize effect an affect: thus a split and tendency towards 
psychological interminable and indeterminate states: or the 
difference for example between types of state and types of 
states.

of course these distinctions don't hold under scrutiny; i'm 
fascinated working with the abject, the underbelly of the world 
we live in, and equally fascinated by contemplating cosmology, 
particle physical, mathematics and their entanglement. music is 
interstitial, bounded on one hand by limited potentials and for 
that matter by human hearing and its vicissitudes, and on the 
other, by dwelling within coordinated affect, no matter the 
bandwidth. everything meshes, doesn't it?

scales running on two unusual instruments - the Okinawan sanshin 
and the Chinese qinqin (the latter is a new instrument with 
seven equidistant frets to the octave). i'm running the Japanese 
in and various Chinese scales which are also mixed with 
Cambodian scales and at times something sounding like old-time 
banjo, too much confusion and too little accuracy perhaps on my 
part. i'm running everything to the limits of my ability, using 
constantly changing intervals played and replayed on one and 
another string... good learning here in Brooklyn, NY... good 
music the result...

Sad and Hopeful Song for Ossi the Cat

Guzheng
http://www.alansondheim.org/insts01.jpg

The guzheng is a Chinese zither, plucked on the right-hand side, 
which is tuned with both pegs and bridges. The left-hand side is 
'out of tune,' and the strings are pressed down on the left to 
raise the pitch on the right. Think of the left-hand side as a 
support structure, an abject cacophony of potential sound, an 
existence in the depths, played when the soul is deeper than 
scales and perfect tuning. (I play back and forth, among the 
fields in this piece.) But the left is also, I think, the field 
of spirit, of universal cosmology, of dark matter, and here I 
play for our cat, Ossi Oswalda, who is doing poorly now, but 
still with us, after ten seizures over four days three months 
ago, and those numbers are meaningless as we stay close to her 
and hope for the best. The piece is a threnody of hope, listen, 
(she did, but then she had no choice!), thanks.
