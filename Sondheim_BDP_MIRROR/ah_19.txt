You never listen to you.

I'm free to be you and me. A room of my own... I'm you, okay? Face under
fire... That's easy for me to say. Take a walk in your shoes. I am every-
thing to you. I promise you a rose garden. You are what you write. You
never said that to anyone before. You just opened your my mouth and my
words came. I just opened my mouth and your words came. I never said that
to anyone before. I am what I write. You promise me a rose garden. You are
everything to me. That's easy for you to say. Space under fire... You're
me, okay? A room of your own. You're free to be you and me. 

My underpants are half-way down my legs. Your underpants are half-way down
your legs. Your panties are half-way down my legs. My panties are half-way
down your legs. Would you be my animal.

Spread your lips, smell your hands. Finger your ass, smell your fingers. 
Squeeze your balls, smell your hands. Squeeze your cock, smell your fing-
ers. Would you be my animal.

Tell me something your wife doesn't know. Tell me something your husband
doesn't know. I want to do you like your husband doesn't. I want to do you
like your wife doesn't. I want to make you as comfortable as possible. 
Open yourself more. Open yourself more and more. I want to make you as 
uncomfortable as possible.

You mean everything to me. You mean nothing to me. I mean everything to 
you. I mean nothing to you. I love myself. I love you. You love yourself. 
You love me. You hate me. I hate you. Crawl for me. Crawl for me. I hate 
me. You hate me. I'll do anything you say. You'll do anything I say. You 
do me. I do you.
