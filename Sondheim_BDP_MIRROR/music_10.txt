Track 11 is recorded live on the same keyboard acoustically; you can hear 
breathing, key and nail sounds, and so forth. The recording is stereo. 
Here the machine gives way to the periphery of the human player One might 
place this configuration in the symbolic.

The Cluster tracks are recorded from a very large Beowulf computer cluster 
which generates considerable electromagnetic radiation in the radio 
spectrum. These are recorded acoustically from a Realistic Patrolman SW-60 
radio slowly tuned across various SW, VHF, and UHF bands. This is the 
sound of the machine in air, transformed into audio signals within the 
range of human hearing. Machine-states and machine exist in the imaginary. 
Emanents exist within and without the machine.

Think of the true world in all its glory.
