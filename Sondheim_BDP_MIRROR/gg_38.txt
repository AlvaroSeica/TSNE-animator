Hollowed, Wean

Every thing is born in youthful innocence, made tiny and perfect and
pure, not a blemish in the world. Every little thing... We should remember
this, staring with tears in our eyes at the little piece of candy, fallen
to the ground, out of a loved one's basket. Do look at the ruins around
you and celebrate this day as funereal.
