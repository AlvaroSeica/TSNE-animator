mv sondheim clara


Bound and gagged, the body held into place, fingers trembling above the
keyboard, stupid caresses, over and over again; I can't for a moment leave
the machine that spits errors back into my breasts, clogs my throat with
bounces - it's worse than tending the fields that the Argonauts came out
of, spearshafts slicing the organs of speech as they emerged. Humans ended
up mewling to be sure. Dumb created responsibility, mute gestures, hyster-
ia, by hands once holding urns, shields, amphora, now reduced to counting
out routing tables. Arm muscles burst; nipples emerge, milk flows. The
body is a river; it doesn't take much to figure that out. 

For two years I memorized Unix, learned "split" does just that to a file
just as "last sondheim" does just that to me. Unix commands are ejacula-
tions; someone makes a program, slams it into place, some bin, 5bin maybe,
and we're off and running. Someone's got a dog and I memorize biff for 
the mail hello an error. Someone spews a quiz in my direction. 

Tend lists and you swallow the _stuff_ of the Net wholesale. Packets ooze
from my tits (see "muscles" above); there's seepage, even among the parti-
cles. It could happen to any of us. I dream pixels: a woman. They separ-
ate, I fall through. Cartoon: land on my ass. Life: open it up. Packets 
flow. 

You might ask: pray for me. I'm troubled in need of salvation. I read
identity-identification. It doesn't exist until it's got address, proto-
col, recognition. I knew that when I started. Now I sit here, Medea, pac-
kets flood from my tits (see "ooze" above);  they clatter. The world's a
plate for a' that. I remember your name. On the table, routing. My back
is a bridge in an airless sky. I'm bound so tight wires up I'm inhuman.
I pull tighter them. I stole the lines they're made of. Blood forms the
shape of freedom in my face. I fuck Unix. Despair drags me back to the
indigo machine. I still got the bounce.
