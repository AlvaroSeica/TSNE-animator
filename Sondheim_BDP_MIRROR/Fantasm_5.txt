		the last sonnet which has lost its capitals
		lost its title to the rank of little, 
		fascist / which has lost its rhythm
		for existence but's still expected
		to cut and strip the skin, return it cleansed
		and fucked, secretly, for a day and for a night
		night after night - that we bow signifies 
		both severance and perseverance
		that you might enumerate guns and races:
		our letters are shamed but they're alive
		by your munificent grace and glory oh my
		perfect christian lads and lasses
		to bring the wrath of god deserved and swallowed
		torched one of them and among us
