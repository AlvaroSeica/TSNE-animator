Self-Extracting_Dream.exe


A friend of mine had a dream which appeared in the form of a self-extract-
ing file; she woke up while it was being unloaded. I tend to dream as a
Torah-Night-of-White-Flame-Letters against black backgrounds of infinite
Satin, not a depth, but not a surface either or as well. There are times
that controls appear, attempting to constrain the texts in one form or
another. I never dream of Nikuko or Julu, but there is a vague Jennifer-
woman mounting, out of my pasts, as devices are mounted on a hard drive
- not sexual, so much as a potential presencing. More personal dreams tend
towards violence and body mutilation; I have awakened in the middle of the
night full of fear and trembling before no god. Years ago there were name-
less, imageless dreams, the worst; I wouldn't sleep for days after. Now I
think of self-extraction, and perhaps there is a cancel present before the
body is fully formed; some files may be corrupted, some missing, some nev-
er entered in the first place. Someone attempts to corrupt a body-being-
formed, pleasure taken in simultaneous creation and destruction. The third
alternative, annihilation to the limit (the title of one of my essays), is
only the dream of a dream, and not in technicolor, and not a dream-coat,
but a kimono hiding Swords <File corrupted: Insufficient Memory>
