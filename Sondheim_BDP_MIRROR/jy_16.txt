To a T

Time for the scythe, time for the reaper
Time for the mowing which loses the lawn -
Torn to the right, paper is deeper
Than the homegrown print, than the home-grown lawn.
Then turn the home towards the metal deeper in paper
Timed towards torn flux, you know about the trace,
The ash, the bark, the tree, the foliage,
The paper of redwoods, sequoia, taller paper,
Taller than others, timed for the furrow, 
Tinned for the moment, this memo torn from the pad,
Torn from the bedroom, kitchen, bath or closet,
Turned towards you from my torn lawn,
Torn paper deeper than you've torn my screen into.
