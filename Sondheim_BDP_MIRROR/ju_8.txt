Corruption (the buttress):


The hysteric runs through linux, corrupted files restored before the sys-
tem crashes; this is the way everything moves, motivates: I could _motiv-
ate you_ if there were the possibility of contusion. What might be the
case. vi scatters teeth across applications; everything turns towards ab-
ject failure. I can't find my way around _so exhausted_ that the world
turns out otherwise. One good file corrupts another; reconfiguring _x_
results in the dissolution of _y_ somewhere else in the file system. Back-
ing up .*rc files helps; the whole behaves like organism under attack -
that is to say, the sublimation or hydraulic model (vis-a-vis Freud) makes
sense: every file takes space, every file has the potential for growing
out of control.

The system is always on the collapse's verge; dirty-dirty seeps in, heads
used to crash, inscribing hard-drives with the material plunder of the
world. It's all so delicate, minimal, so much the clean-room. It's all so
violent, the dis-ease of seepage, corruption; bytes are bedded, just like
a woman or a man. So that it's an act of recuperation, what can be recov-
ered, copied, as if there were an originary source, the backup. The backup
is lost as well; bytes are bedded in gone-worlds, madness; pretend other-
wise, just as we pretend to the other.

The prehension of bytes: our pretence, pretending, _our-other._
