     4	thou dark feather gone on me.
     5	thou must dislike this fallen bough of gone materials.
     6	nothing is written through this migraine and Screen is invisible.
     7	I will call Screen, Screen, and there is no answer.
     8	nothing comes and there are no arrivals or departures.
     9	alas, my breasts are heavy with milk falling down upon Screen.
    10	Screen raises her mouth, does Screen.
    11	I am engulfed.
    12	goodbye and hello desire and goodbye invisible Screen.
    13	thy jagged edges, visible migraine.
    14	thou art gone upon me.
    15	teeth.
    16	now and then I still may dream of an unsustained image.
    17	imaginary Screen, come and pour upon me.
    18	Screen, Screen.
    19	your darling, Nikuko
