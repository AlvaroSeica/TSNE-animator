phenomenology of radio earth


phenomenology of the earth in relation to vlf and crystal - how fields 
recreate an alternative 'mapping' of the planet, encased in a skein or 
membrane of radiation (radiations, single or plural).

these mappings are always 'cleansed' - pure no matter what the ostensible 
content of the carriers. from a technical viewpoint it's all modulation, 
all encoding. extrapolate from this back to visual perception - there's 
that neutrality again, as if every visible, every wound, suture, object, 
process, were not only of equal value, but of null value, or rather - as 
if value had no place in the world.

Buddha might have relegated suffering to the broadcast band.

induction forms intimacies with the earth; crystals are the fundamental 
filters, assigning direction and flux to topological space.

earphones etc. are nothing more than mechanisms of evidence; - it's here 
that the origin enters into the image - earphones establish the origin: of 
the perceiver, but also of the signal content and the implications of the 
location of the signal itself, if not the location itself.

loop and magnetism, but also loop and interrupter, the self-containment of 
the loop. the loop virtualizes the magnetic flux transmission, inheres it.

the phenomenology of the open ground/antenna system implying segment or 
vector; the earth and skies are tied to their fields, extended elsewhere 
and continuously.

this tends to become too mystical, too much Heidegger who might has well 
been describing early radio; the Fourfold is superhetrodyning.

>> the idea is to listen to the weakest part of the band, amplify until 
something, no matter what, is heard - the potential well falls apart here 
- i.e. the signal-to-noise ratio of safe information collapses. <<

think of coils and communities, coils as circumambulations surrounding 
what is peripheral, perhaps preset. communities of ostensible content, 
speech, interferences, adjacencies.

capacitors - inductors - proximities all: metal near metal, curled or 
flattened. every capacitor induces, every inductor capacitates.

CB radio as relic community - how does this relate to the net - CB hacking 
- how does this relate to codework. CB: local straggling across the earth; 
your car or truck extends nine-miles in every direction.

what could constitute mineral or organic inductors, capacitors - was there 
physical circuitry before humans. it's important to imagine radio as al- 
ways already present, not only as background/interference, but as fore- 
ground/content, intentional transmission.

i don't want to harbor on this, remain in this harbor of spectral audio. i 
don't want to remain here, i want to point out the myriad phenomena, their 
constituents, their being-thought-through in problem worlds, or rather, 
their problems in the worlds of knowing. then it's time to leave the con- 
sort, or for random acts of internalization, surgical knowledge, then it's 
time to leave those as well.

[10:30]  Miulew Takahe: hello alan!
[10:30]  Esther DeCuir: afk
[10:31]  You: Because virtual space is cleansed, purified, and one can 
always sign out when things get too hot. But investigating, producing, 
corrupting, exalting, the abject body, that's something else, this body 
which is both prim and flesh, which doesn't quite let go when you hit 
delete or quit.
[10:31]  Paco Mariani: sorry esther
[10:32]  Esther DeCuir: np!

[10:52]  You: SURFING THE WORLD WIDE WEB!
[10:52]  You: I LOVE THESE INTERNETS!
[10:52]  sandy Taifun: You begin to understand that not all avatars are 
bots or expert systems that some of them are symptoms just as I am
[10:55]  sandy Taifun: Avatars are always disturbances, always 
irruptions of language, a lang- uage portending _the raveling of 
existence and essence
[10:55]  You: getting near time to begin

[10:56]  sandy Taifun:     Enter the new reality     The world, 
suffused with sound. 
[10:56]  There is no suitable surface to sit on, try another spot.
[10:56]  sandy Taifun: Over Lord 1      Quon: The tone of war... Wings 
creak, the sound of a beginning.          (Subtitle)  
[10:56]  sandy Taifun: My avatars! My little people! They run around 
everywhere, underfoot. I will play a  song, a little aire, a jig or 
rondelay!
[10:57]  You: getting near time to begin
[10:57]  sandy Taifun: I wish I was home making new avatars on my  
computer to fuck with. 
[11:01]  sandy Taifun: engineering and reverse engineering an avatar

into a deadly inferno within seconds Friday, when a hot air balloon 
burst into flames.
[11:05]  You: testing one two three
[11:05]  You: that will be later
[11:06]  You: sure
[11:06]  You: if you do i should perhaps comment while it's running - 
hope it's not too long
[11:07]  Miulew Takahe: i think it is 10 minutes
[11:07]  Miulew Takahe: WE ARE SOON ABOUT TO START
[11:07]  You: whatever you think would be good here -
[11:07]  Miulew Takahe: WELCOME EVERYONE
[11:08]  Maxxo Klaar: Hello dearest art lovers and friends from all 
spreads ;-) at our last talks of the little DRESSCODE AVATAR week
[11:08]  Maxxo Klaar: Tonight I'm very excited to welcome Alan Sondheim 
and Sandy Baldwin @art.xxXtenxion
[11:08]  Maxxo Klaar: I would like to screen first a video by Alan, 
which for me pretty much shows a lot of insights and aspects of his 
work on the avatar topic. This video is called mini and lasts exactly 
10 minutes.
[11:10]  You: let me know when the video is about to begin and i will i 
will behave honest i iwll iwllbehvesds
[11:10]  Miulew Takahe: STARTS SOON...

[11:11]  Howl Yifu: thanks for the welcome. ok i speak for sandy
[11:11]  Maxxo Klaar: great
[11:11]  Maxxo Klaar: alan prepared a performance lecture for us titled 
AVATAR DRESS CODES. and i guess we will be in for some surprising 3D 
poetry from sandy which should be terrific. sandy is researching on 
that topic and we are so happy he will share with us the latest hot 
stuff. ;-)
[11:11]  You: i speak for nikuko

[11:14]  Maxxo Klaar: so the space is all yours alan and sandy now ^^
[11:14]  You: flesh in the something or other....
[11:14]  You: WE'll I'll begin, I'm going to try pasting what I want to 
say and if that doesn't work I'll type in
[11:14]  You: better yet it might be best if I type in
[11:14]  You: I'm not sure what re: dresscode references since we're 
speaking of prims here and protocols and linden so hear goes:
[11:15]  You: "Of course the dress-code is code and what protocol 
structures there are: - in other words, it's just what's a given in the 
space
[11:15]  You: or the spatial subtext sometimes it makes me think of Kant
[11:15]  You: I have no idea re: - and this is the background to all of 
this -
[11:15]  You: what Linden, what Michael Linden or the others know
[11:16]  You: - if this is anything like the older MOOs, the wizards 
there - I was one - you could literally read/see anything/everything in 
the database
[11:16]  You: which was completely open -
[11:16]  You: so for the Lindens it might just be a question of 
processing the flow of say 30k people at once. but I see no reason they 
couldn't follow each and every avatar/space
[11:17]  You: so that's our limit here; we're working in apotentially 
transparent environment of course.
[11:17]  You: for me - hopefully that did come through?
[11:17]  You: For me building, that's building something in the space 
besides the shadow-lozenge that accompanies me and speak of my death 
and destruction -
[11:17]  You: Are you reading this? there are no words appearing at 
this end, - those lines were reversed, that's lag for you
[11:18]  You: anyway, I thinkm of building as a kind of masquerade, 
participating in a dubious economy I can't afford
[11:18]  sandy Taifun: we read in the other direction
[11:18]  Lanne Wise: reading fine for me
[11:18]  You: literally can't afford -
[11:18]  Maxxo Klaar: i m reading alan
[11:18]  filmwand: The movie will play soon directly from d-oo-b video 
server. Ask Eifachfilm Vacirca for details. d-^.^-b
[11:18]  You: And I'd want, if I did participate, the knowledge that 
the land, that is th esubtext or ontology here, would out-exist the 
lindens; otherwise, for me it's useless
[11:19]  You: but in any case I've spent only $2.40 on Second Life so 
far.
[11:19]  You: To the more serius issues - I identify with Gaz' work 
because of the dis/comfort it causes - it's this dis/comfort and the 
accompanying pcyhoanalytical issues
[11:19]  You: that fascinate me and I think for me is important in this 
space.
[11:20]  You: Because virtual space is cleansed, purified, and one can 
always sign out when things get too hot - .
[11:20]  You: This is the opposite of Levinas' alterity or Sartre's for 
that matter, where a gaze is obdurage, can't be avoided.
[11:20]  You: Where you can be annihilated or created/reformulated by 
the Other.
[11:20]  You: Here youj just leave.
[11:21]  You: Which is why I'm interested in investigating, producing, 
corrupting, exalting, exhibiting, the abject body -
[11:21]  You: that's something else, this body which is both prim and 
flesh,
[11:21]  You: a body which doesn't quite let go when you hit delete or 
quit.
[11:22]  You: It's this body that reminds you of flesh in the midst of 
non-flesh, that speaks, for that matter, that _matter_, of the number 
tattooed on a survivor's arm - and the relation of that number to the 
system of integers.

[11:23]  You: Every arm, leg, big rez, hot car, agro, hack, swollen 
outfitting, is sex, most often phallic here, writ large. Every phallus 
is a masquerade, nullpoint, whose transcendent meaning disappears in 
the vagaries of real and quote weak flesh.
[11:23]  You: Weak flesh: avalanches kill people, they're just snow.
[11:24]  Sagesse Sautereau: hi
[11:24]  You: I'm quite possibly in the wrong place/space, but I miss 
issues ofr governance in Second Life, issues implicit in the software, 
not riding the World Wide Web.
[11:24]  filmwand: The movie will play soon directly from d-oo-b video 
server. Ask Eifachfilm Vacirca for details. d-^.^-b
[11:24]  You: It's as if we're allowed to talk endlessly here.
[11:24]  You: Do what we want etc. in someone else's space, borrowed 
life, which is still better than no life at all.
[11:25]  You: Just a word here about MOOs - anyone could (and can) set 
one up - look at the code, thanks to Pavil Curtis and others. And MOOs 
give you an idea of the governance issues - what's at stake - and the 
transparency of power
[11:25]  You: Now the SL engine's far more complex; it's monolithic, 
distributed but appears monolithic; were's in a GIVEN space like the 
earth, but one, like the ghetto, that can be taken away from us at any 
time.
[11:26]  You: So we're feudal, peasantry, and dress accordingly, 
something of the carnival comes to mind, Bakhtin
[11:26]  You: On an email list - someone complained, I think on empyre?
[11:27]  You: that there's no Guernica in second life. But there is: 
Gaz's dress/ed/de/codings - my body: these are Guernicas, as safe and 
dangerous as Picasso. Response Guernicas, that process and are 
processed in an environment - not masterpieces which, with all their 
delicacy, are left behind.
[11:27]  filmwand: The movie will play soon directly from d-oo-b video 
server. Ask Eifachfilm Vacirca for details. d-^.^-b
[11:27]  You: SL might disappear tomorrow, who knows, but this is a 
radical change from any real we've known, there's no turning back, not 
even if teh net collapses tomorrow.
[11:28]  You: Back to the dress code. My avatar appears to bleed. My 
avatar's a woman, sourcing speech, behavior, chora, abjection, Timaeus, 
Kristeva. Her body distorts, her body always returns from distortions.
[11:29]  You: She came out of my work with another avatar that's still 
the same, Nikuko, who appeared in print and video for a long time; 
Nikuko's a demiurge; this avatar, an extension of Nikuko, is 
demiurgency.
[11:29]  You: It's name is Nikuko but it uses the name Alan and write 
me withn her. The very interactivity, dialectic, of Second Life, 
ensures she's only in partial control, just as one might wander,
[11:29]  You: Situationist-like, through any city.
[11:30]  You: She's dressed nude or blood-covered or organ-covered; 
she's tantra-fierce, I'm her consort, not the other way around.
[11:30]  filmwand: The movie will play soon directly from d-oo-b video 
server. Ask Eifachfilm Vacirca for details. d-^.^-b
[11:30]  You: She leads me. She inhabits me. I face myself in her in an 
_uncanny maner._ It's not comfortable, comforting; when she leaves the 
space through extreme behavior
[11:31]  You: I can't find her or myself any more than you can.
[11:31]  You: Her root is still here; you can read/feel the language, 
but she's gone.
[11:31]  You: I can't see through her eyes.
[11:31]  You: I'm a camera.
[11:31]  You: Her otoins are behaviors or behavior collisions - 
combinations of behaviors that result in contradictions, one bvh file 
piled on top of another. The behaviors themselves are, for the most 
part, constructed from motion capture equipment
[11:32]  You: using live human performers. But the mocap sensors are 
re-arranged toc reate virtual bodies in real physical space, and it's 
these virtual bodies and their motions that are mapped
[11:32]  You: onto the Second Life avatar.
[11:32]  You: There's a clear relationship to dance here. I work with 
Azure Carter, Foofwa d'Imobilite, Maud Liardon in the past -
[11:33]  filmwand: The movie will play soon directly from d-oo-b video 
server. Ask Eifachfilm Vacirca for details. d-^.^-b
[11:33]  You: A fair mount of the work's been nude in real life - not 
to create a 'pure' body , but to give the cultured, acculturated, body, 
room to breathe.
[11:33]  You: If you've seen our videos, you'll find real-world 
imitations of avatar imitations of real-world behaviors; the spaces 
shimmer and meld into each other, all of them, in virtual and liver 
performances all over the place
[11:34]  You: Sexuality is always in the eye of the beholder; it's not 
in the prims. I enter the sheaved interior of my avatar (which I have 
to slow up! hold on)
[11:34]  Paco Mariani: dear audience, please press the media stream 
down right ;)
[11:34]  filmwand: The movie will play soon directly from d-oo-b video 
server. Ask Eifachfilm Vacirca for details. d-^.^-b
[11:34]  You: Anyway to continue
[11:35]  You: Nikuko's nude within a triply-articulated space -
[11:35]  Maxxo Klaar: just continue alan,m we should watch later
[11:35]  You: 1 Articulated by the exigencies of the avatar-construct 
itself;
[11:35]  You: 2. Articulated by motion-capture files that are then 
chained or collided;
[11:35]  You: 3. Articulated by the Linden contextuality and all that's 
implied there.
[11:36]  You: Nikuko behaves, one way or another, variously i various 
spaces. I work as much as possible at the edge of the game-space, where 
physics is different, and where I'm mostly alone or working with Sandy 
Baldwin.
[11:37]  You: (those are triggers)
[11:37]  You: ...but then I imagine furiously dancing arcoss the 
landscape, inscape, outscape,
[11:37]  You: roiling, creating havoc,
[11:37]  You: everywhere, everywhere I go,
[11:37]  You: just churning like a star half-way burnt to a cinder, 
burned-out,
[11:37]  You: dead before 1914-, 1939, 2002,
[11:38]  Maxxo Klaar: thank you allan
[11:38]  You: for my name might as well be Anita Berber as Nikuko, or 
Walter Benjamin for that matter,
[11:38]  You: just posed there betwen Spain and France, RL and SL, on 
the edge of armageddon
[11:38]  You: thanks, and now Sandy Baldwin....
[11:38]  Howl Yifu: WE ARE A NEW- AND NON-SPECIES HERE
[11:39]  Maxxo Klaar: thx again, so very very interesting
[11:39]  Howl Yifu: IN RELATION TO NIETZSCHE'S QUESTION "WHAT IS NOBLE?"
[11:39]  Howl Yifu: I speak in relation to animal spendor and display
[11:39]  Howl Yifu: I see "avatar dresscode" in terms of excessive 
inter-special relations that cannot be simply acounted for socially or 
informatically.
[11:40]  Howl Yifu: I'm thinking here of the logic Portmann develops in 
the book on _Animal Forms_ of "organs to be looked at," that I tie to 
ostentation or splendor.
[11:40]  Howl Yifu: So, not only "transfer effects" (the 
becoming-ornament of interior states as part of intra-species seduction 
and ritual, etc.)
[11:40]  Howl Yifu: but to a kind of exorbitant riskiness towards the 
Other that I think is also described by the "handicap principle" of the 
Zahevi's.
[11:41]  Howl Yifu: (display at risk beyond survival...)
[11:41]  Howl Yifu: So, avatar dresscode neither in terms of the 
semiotics of performance within Second Life,
[11:41]  Howl Yifu: nor of the difference between these codes and the 
real world / first life,
[11:41]  Howl Yifu: but rather avatar dresscode as about existence, 
impermanence, and compassion.
[11:42]  Howl Yifu: And, at the same time, I am trying to think about 
the problems of using this argument,
[11:42]  Howl Yifu: e.g. environmental and predatory issues of 
inter-species communications qua Second Life.
[11:42]  Howl Yifu: How to compare SL build such and such with 
exigencies of decaying ecosystems and hunter-gather-behavior?
[11:43]  Howl Yifu: plumes nectar beaks
[11:43]  Howl Yifu: Towards this, I speak of through the profundity of 
surface itself.
[11:43]  Howl Yifu: I speak of there is impermance and splendor, there 
is nothing and nobility.
[11:43]  Howl Yifu: I speak of through what is the splendor of avatars. 
I speak of through what is a noble avatar.
[11:44]  Howl Yifu: Dress code firstly as camouflage.
[11:44]  Howl Yifu: Camo: I code myself avatar to appear.
[11:44]  Howl Yifu: Camo: I transcode myself avatar with and against 
the community standards of behavior.
[11:44]  Howl Yifu: Secondly, and in following, dress code as 
semantics, as the depth beyond camouflage.
[11:45]  Howl Yifu: I express myself avatar.
[11:45]  Howl Yifu: I experience myself avatar. I mask myself avatar. I 
armor myself avatar
[11:45]  Howl Yifu: "We hope you'll have a richly rewarding experience, 
filled with creativity, self expression and fun," goes the welcome to 
second life.
[11:45]  Howl Yifu: Mark all these terms: "we," "you," "richly 
rewarding experience," "creativity," self expression," "fun."
[11:45]  Howl Yifu: Codes with addresses, signals with sources.
[11:46]  Howl Yifu: The big six of tolerance, harassment, assault, 
disclosure, indency, disturbing the peace
[11:46]  Howl Yifu: - set out in community standards -
[11:46]  Howl Yifu: redress and address code semantics in camouflage.
[11:46]  Howl Yifu: i.e. The address and source of avatar may be deep 
or shallow, but they are personal and proper.
[11:47]  Howl Yifu: You avatar look at me avatar.
[11:47]  Howl Yifu: mollusk antlers luxury automobiles
[11:47]  Howl Yifu: All this is of through being human.
[11:47]  Howl Yifu: I leave being human let it fight over the scraps of 
richly rewarding experience.
[11:47]  Howl Yifu: The splendor of avatar, the noble avatar is a third 
logic of ostentation, of impersonal monstration.
[11:47]  Howl Yifu: There is existence here.
[11:48]  Howl Yifu: Not camouflage there is avatar existence.
[11:48]  Howl Yifu: Speak of through the great ephemeral skin of 
existence are a segmented organism.
[11:48]  Howl Yifu: Avatar is not an image of my body; it is, however, 
part of the imaging of my body, part of the visual imaginary of my body.
[11:48]  Howl Yifu: These postural diagram of/through body.
[11:48]  Howl Yifu: gestures going nowhere, words of splendor
[11:48]  Free Radar HUD v1.1 by Crystal Gadgets
[11:49]  Howl Yifu: Tantra: I confess that avatar is an emanation of me 
that consumes me consumes confession.
[11:49]  Howl Yifu: I am consumed in splendor.
[11:49]  Howl Yifu: stones blood cut that's all thanks
[11:49]  sandy Taifun: Avatars are always disturbances, always 
irruptions of language, a lang- uage portending _the raveling of 
existence and essence
[11:49]  sandy Taifun: natyasatrotpatti: mythical origin of the work
[11:49]  sandy Taifun: You begin to understand that not all avatars are 
bots or expert systems that some of them are symptoms just as I am
[11:49]  sandy Taifun: the subject on the other/ near side of the 
screen 
[11:50]  sandy Taifun: this machine: undoes his belt buckle for him, 
finds the right diagram with which to support my weight, tongue, zone, 
other love
[11:50]  sandy Taifun: MOUTH LETS GO OF CHAINS OF SENTENCES, RAMPLES, 
GIGGLES, TONGUES SPREAD WET OUT OVER LIPS, LEAKS, COLLAPSES, MELTS, HIS 
FINGERS
[11:50]  filmwand: The movie will play soon directly from d-oo-b video 
server. Ask Eifachfilm Vacirca for details. d-^.^-b
[11:52]  You: because there's lag here
[11:52]  sandy Taifun: consider the _projection of the self_ - its 
written or constituted appearance - in various applications
[11:52]  sandy Taifun: We do look at ruptures or disturbances created 
by characters resonating or interfering with configuration files
[11:52]  You: there's no control and no tomorrow
[11:52]  You: says nikuko
[11:52]  sandy Taifun: gave new Life to my Avatar and now Her  Body 
moves just like I would move if I had a File called God
[11:52]  You: not certain where she is
[11:53]  sandy Taifun: the beginning of transparency, wizard 
listening-posts on MOOs for example. Here we are, the virtual 
becoming-virtual still. 
[11:53]  sandy Taifun: Given that the danced-to-infinity motion-capture 
second=life quasi-avatar  is tethered at a root somewhat distanced
[11:54]  sandy Taifun: construction torsion near avatar edge-space. the 
limits of avatar are the limits of world. 
[11:54]  sandy Taifun: avatar anorectic 
[11:54]  You: Avatar-woman balks, looks out
[11:54]  sandy Taifun: i prefer the small, seeping, the peripeheral, 
marginal, the scattered words
[11:54]  sandy Taifun: outcries screams unnatural acts after-image 
liquefy vaporize crime shortcircuit dissipate thickness passion trigger 
calculate
[11:54]  sandy Taifun: OOH AHH OOH AHH YOU ARE YOU ARE OOH AHH OOH AHH 
YOU ARE YOU ARE OOH AHH OOH AAH YOUR ARE YOUR ARE OOH AAH YOURS YOURS 
ARMS ARMS
[11:54]  You: looks outside, says
[11:54]  sandy Taifun: rudding odors sweat vaginal semen ova 
decompositions bacteria vegetation and hummingbirds and sparrows and 
flies and mites and
[11:54]  sandy Taifun: "i detest her because i know her well" "i will 
imitate her" "i will curse her" "i have felt"
[11:54]  You: nothing doing
[11:54]  sandy Taifun: rangadevatapujana: worship of the deities 
connected with the stage
[11:55]  sandy Taifun: My avatars! My little people! They run around 
everywhere, underfoot. I will play a  song, a little aire, a jig or 
rondelay!
[11:55]  sandy Taifun: My avatars! My little people! They run around 
everywhere, underfoot. I will play a  song, a little aire, a jig or 
rondelay!
[11:55]  sandy Taifun: thanks
[11:56]  Miulew Takahe: /claps
[11:56]  You: The lag was horrendous here which shows
[11:56]  Lanne Wise: BRAVO
[11:56]  J0RI Tokyo: /claps
[11:56]  You: that it's impossible to be anything but solitary although 
I'd love to see a chorus-line stopped
[11:56]  Maxxo Klaar: bravo,
[11:56]  You: in mid-air
[11:56]  You: thank you for both and all of us!
[11:56]  Howl Yifu: yes thanks -
[11:56]  You: if there are any questions...
[11:56]  Maxxo Klaar: WE ARE A NEW- AND NON-SPECIES HERE
[11:57]  sandy Taifun: yes, we are
[11:57]  Maxxo Klaar: There is existence here. Not camouflage there is 
avatar existence.
[11:57]  Maxxo Klaar: avatar dresscode as about existence, 
impermanence, and compassion. I experience myself avatar. I mask myself 
avatar. I armor myself avatar
[11:57]  Howl Yifu: My avatars! My little people! They run around 
everywhere, underfoot. I will play a song, a little aire, a jig or 
rondelay!
[11:57]  You: Well, all of this plays out against the background of 
unbelievable cruelty in the real world
[11:57]  You: not only against humans, but animals, the environment as 
a whole
[11:58]  You: the suffering is unimaginable, and i think indicates a 
responsibility
[11:58]  You: for using this space? maybe in relation to that? or , I 
don't know; most of the time we're in despair,
[11:58]  Maxxo Klaar: shall there be some questions or ideas from the 
audience?
[11:58]  sandy Taifun: that strikes me in your talk alan: insistence on 
the clean purified virtual dirtied by the real?
[11:58]  You: but on the other hand this shouldn't be escapist I 
think...
[11:58]  You: the idea of the clean and proper body
[11:58]  sandy Taifun: no, not dirtied, but shot through by 
responsibility
[11:59]  You: comes from Kristeva I think in relation to fascisn
[11:59]  Lanne Wise: that does create a certain tension here....which 
you seem to be addressing
[11:59]  Lanne Wise: thank you for that
[11:59]  You: fascism with its emphasis on purity of all sorts, the 
term ethnic cleansing comes to mind
[11:59]  You: and I think this is characteristic of anything digital; 
dirt in digital just destroys the illusion, breaks the protocols down
[12:00]  Hars Hefferman: ?
[12:00]  You: the analog on the other hand, the real world, is fecund, 
replete, with dirt , suffering, abjection - which I think is important, 
just as alterity is
[12:00]  Hars Hefferman: !
[12:01]  Lanne Wise: and there was a moment....when I thought of 
Whitman's Song of Myself...I celebrate the body digital.....
[12:01]  Howl Yifu: or i sing the body electic
[12:01]  Maxxo Klaar: most people think the 3d - worlds are full of 
dirt and sick ideas and not the real - they take the real for granted
[12:01]  Howl Yifu: ecclectic
[12:01]  Lanne Wise: absolutely
[12:01]  Lanne Wise: :-)
[12:02]  You: I think the two are so psychoanalytically 
interpenetrated, fucked, that it's impossible, inconceivable, to 
separate them
[12:02]  Lanne Wise: well....true...but it happened so quickly that you 
have to try and look back to see how - don't you?
[12:02]  You: Most people also think the Internet is a catchall for 
'perverts' who will reach through the screen and grab your kids, 
whatever
[12:02]  You: you're right
[12:03]  Howl Yifu: the dirt gets cleansed here, so we can desire 
whatever we will, and at the same time, everything is lurid -
[12:03]  You: there's something medieval about this space, literally 
iconographic much like Giotto
[12:03]  Maxxo Klaar: alan , you mentioned : there seems to be a matter 
of reversal - you said i m her consort... She leads me. She inhabits 
me. I face myself in her in an _uncanny maner._ It's not comfortable, 
comforting; when she leaves the space through extreme behavior - She 
leads me. She inhabits me. I face myself in her in an _uncanny maner._ 
It's not comfortable, comforting; when she leaves the space through 
extreme behavior
[12:03]  Howl Yifu: also medieval in the sense of allegory (perhaps too 
academic)
[12:03]  Maxxo Klaar: so are you some kind of avatar to nikuko?
[12:03]  You: don't forget the gold-leafed backgrounds in Giotto, the 
materiality (at that point) of light and allegory
[12:04]  You: Yes, doubly-smeared. I read a lot of tantric texts and 
they emphasize male consorts;
[12:04]  You: but the necessity of the female consort in relation to 
the male - still it's the woman facing the man, and I wonder how this 
plays out in reverse -
[12:04]  sandy Taifun: can you talk about this in terms of 
ghost/shamanic relations?
[12:05]  You: I haven't seen anything on it - there's female literature 
in the Pali texts but I'm still looking
[12:05]  Maxxo Klaar: this is very interesting, this reversal
[12:05]  sandy Taifun: not we dream the avatar but it pulls and dreams 
us
[12:05]  You: Ghost-traps? I think come into play; shamanism is 
something else, it seems specific to me. But the idea of trapping 
ghosts - and this gets back to what Gaz does of course -
[12:06]  sandy Taifun: howso?
[12:06]  You: where you're trapped and transformed, you're looking at 
your own body, Nikuko's looking at her own, and it's distended as if by 
a medical apparatus
[12:06]  You: - she applies surgery - but then when you logout log back 
in, of course you're reset, normalizsed - which is why alterity fails 
here -
[12:06]  You: no matter how abject
[12:06]  You: you can leave or come back and everything's ok
[12:07]  sandy Taifun: inside of the medical appratus
[12:07]  Lanne Wise: I am sorry....I am missing or unaware of the 
connection to ghost-traps here...can you explain that?
[12:07]  You: We'll you're litearlly on the outside, of the prims, in a 
chair, something like that
[12:08]  Howl Yifu: alterity fails - or remains there every surface?
[12:08]  You: Ghost-traps (I think the word is mdos believe it or not) 
are cross-threaded constructions in Tibet for impaling or retarding 
malignant demons; similar construdts are found everywhere in the world. 
So you have ephemeral real-world objects which are mostly non-objects, 
in fact the geometry is polygon-like, catching invisible spirits or 
demons.
[12:09]  Maxxo Klaar: the ghost trapped in the machine
[12:09]  You: No, alterity fails I think - alterity lies in the 
face-to-face encounter
[12:09]  You: Yes!
[12:09]  Lanne Wise: ahhh thank you...yes of course
[12:09]  Lanne Wise: that was it Maxxo - lol
[12:09]  You: Alterity is uncomfortable, if you ask someone for a date 
in RL and are turned down - there are you, annihilated at the age of 
fifteen.
[12:09]  You: I was annihilated a lot!
[12:09]  Howl Yifu: hee hee
[12:09]  Lanne Wise: lol
[12:10]  Maxxo Klaar: he-he
[12:10]  You: But it really does efface you to the depths of your being 
- and online, unless your psychotically invested (whicdh is actually of 
great interest) - this wouldn't happen the same way
[12:10]  Howl Yifu: there's stil an ontological relation here....
[12:10]  You: It's the ability to walk away that led I think to 
flamewars etc, in newsgroups etc.
[12:10]  You: How so?
[12:11]  You: What's the ontological relation? I could see it 
epistemologically, i.e. different knowledges...
[12:11]  Howl Yifu: yes, i'm thinking -
[12:11]  You: But there seems to be an ontological split - everything 
in second life - EVERYTHING - is referent
[12:12]  You: the whole think reeks of the indexical...
[12:12]  Maxxo Klaar: referent to the sl matrix?
[12:12]  Howl Yifu: isn't there necessarily a psyche investment?
[12:12]  Maxxo Klaar: to the digits
[12:12]  You: Referent to RL
[12:12]  Lanne Wise: even this conversation?
[12:12]  You: Absolutely a psychic investment
[12:12]  You: Conversation in this regard I think is interesting -
[12:13]  You: the sememe is the same as in any interactive 
communication - I mean we're talking here, and it's the same
[12:13]  You: habitus to some extent as if we were talking in real life
[12:13]  You: it's the rest, the body, the abject, the wounded, 
suffered, that's so utterly different
[12:13]  You: unless again you're psychotic of course
[12:13]  Howl Yifu: ok, i see. who are you calling psychotic?
[12:14]  Lanne Wise: not last time I looked anyway.....:-)
[12:14]  Maxxo Klaar: could be in irc chat and the rl connection would 
be absolutely on hand
[12:14]  You: No one at all, but I think it's like followers of Elvis 
impersonators! I mean SOMEONE must believe He's come back toLive Within 
Them!
[12:15]  You: I'm thinking of people who can't "let go" of Second Life 
- I used to know people who would be logged into MUDs for example for 
36 hours at a time.
[12:15]  Maxxo Klaar: would you call that a psychic investment also - 
the irc chat ?
[12:15]  Howl Yifu: surely so?
[12:15]  You: That's a different state.
[12:15]  Maxxo Klaar: can last 36 hours too *lol*
[12:16]  You: IRC like ytalk - these are different I think in that our 
own bodies are often foregrounded for lack of visual stimulus but I may 
be way off course here
[12:16]  Maxxo Klaar: only the "body is missing, the flesh and blood"
[12:16]  You: But in a sense that's everything.
[12:16]  Maxxo Klaar: which is quite something
[12:16]  Howl Yifu: foregrounding in irc is another form of 
projection/introjection
[12:16]  You: I haven't seen stats on Second Life sex - I'd be curious 
about it in relation to MOOs, IRC and the like
[12:17]  Maxxo Klaar: that would be interesting, yes
[12:17]  You: And I wonder what most people actually DO is second life. 
THepeople I know who aren't artists usually fly about a lot!
[12:17]  Howl Yifu: sitting is nice too
[12:17]  Maxxo Klaar: one thing wouldnt refer to irc anyway- heres the 
body - the peformer - the coder
[12:17]  You: Ah...
[12:17]  Maxxo Klaar: you said
[12:18]  You: One thing I remember about MOOs that made them 
interesting - when you logged out, your body remained behind.
[12:18]  Maxxo Klaar: i love the guernica picture and that you are 
transriding it to the ^^existential^^ being with the gaz and dojiji 
avatars here
[12:18]  You: Sometimes it was in a 'body bag.
[12:18]  You: But it was _there_ - the kind of disappearance that 
occurs here is uncanny but again emphasizes the distinction between a 
concrete or obdurate alterity and what occurs in the real.
[12:19]  You: Second Life is an eternal jump cut.
[12:19]  You: Literally.
[12:19]  Maxxo Klaar: what do you mean by that analogy?
[12:19]  Maxxo Klaar: with guernica
[12:20]  You: Guernica was I think a wounded responses to a wounded 
slaughter, as if the bodies could not be but otherwise given the 
bombing. And I think of carrying those wounds, constructing those 
wounds here, as a way of reminding ourselves of the real/abject bodies 
outside the fictive space. It's a kind of witnessing in an odd way. I 
may well be reading Gaz wrong here
[12:20]  You: - it'swhat I find in hir work.
[12:21]  Howl Yifu: do you see added modalities - e.g. sl speech - as 
reinforcing the jump cut?
[12:21]  You: I've been thinking a lot about the origin of language in 
scars - we're naked furless creatures, scars, which carry history, show 
up easily -
[12:22]  Lanne Wise: very nice idea.....
[12:22]  You: they're readable, ikonic in that sense - and of course in 
SL the scars have to be constructed, painlessly - it's different, they 
carry only signifiers of manufacture technically
[12:22]  You: but they also reference, through dis/comfort, something 
else...
[12:22]  You: I see btw added modalities as 'suturing' the jump cut
[12:22]  Howl Yifu: ok
[12:23]  You: Speech - always speech - contains the grain of the real 
(this from Barhtes) - in other words, if I speak on the phone, the 
voice is 'there' in a way a projected visual image is not
[12:23]  Lanne Wise: and they are self constructed - scars - which 
gives them another meaning.....another history in SL
[12:23]  You: since the voice is always already projected; it's very 
nature is projection
[12:23]  filmwand: The movie will play soon directly from d-oo-b video 
server. Ask Eifachfilm Vacirca for details. d-^.^-b
[12:23]  You: so speech in SL brings a kind of sense of the real 
closer, it's 'suturing' the cuts in a sense. What if we're talking, you 
turn me down for something or other, and I begin crying?
[12:24]  You: That's obviously different than a 'boohoo' gesture - and 
it's that differencde that in a way constitutes the whole difference 
here
[12:24]  You: Sandy, do you have anything to say or add?
[12:24]  Maxxo Klaar: so are the new talk possibilities interesting for 
your further explorations, alan , sandy?
[12:25]  Howl Yifu: no, except thanks for all that you've said here
[12:25]  You: Oh definitely. There's something called the Access Grid
[12:25]  You: I've used a lot for visual/sound work - it's open source 
virtual audiovisual classrooms
[12:25]  sandy Taifun: internet2 connection
[12:25]  You: and it's possible to throw voice and music/sound around 
the country that way!
[12:25]  sandy Taifun: plus exploration of direct mocap --> sl
[12:26]  You: Yes, I2 - you can get a personal node that can go in 
through DSL, but it'squirky!
[12:26]  sandy Taifun: or more direct than currently
[12:26]  You: There will be choirs springing up al over the place ...
[12:26]  Maxxo Klaar: he-he
[12:26]  Maxxo Klaar: ghost choirs
[12:26]  Lanne Wise: hahaha
[12:26]  You: Or real choirs ghost chairs
[12:27]  You: Just want to thank you for this opportunity for both of 
us!
[12:27]  Lanne Wise: can't wait.....
[12:27]  Maxxo Klaar: yea
[12:27]  Lanne Wise: THNK YOU BOTH!!!
[12:27]  sandy Taifun: yes thanks again.
[12:27]  sandy Taifun: bye!
[12:27]  You: Bye!
[12:27]  Lanne Wise: bye
[12:27]  Maxxo Klaar: i experienced now 90 mins of fulminant thoughts 
and thank you so much for it




My Eclipse


"Are there bread-crumbs on the moon?" I ask M.
"There's precisely one bread-crumb on the moon."
He offers me whiskey and I drink half-glass; he won't stop otherwise,
We're staring at the stars.
A large Hudson drives down the street below us, full of merry-makers;
it's the total eclipse of the moon!
It's three in the morning and we haven't seen anything yet.
It's four.
It's five in the morning and the curtain descends at a distance.
You can see earthlight as frustrated earth denies its own shadow.
"There you are, that's the disk I've been telling you about."
"The moon is round, isn't it?"
The bread-crumb would have dried up by now, blown hither and yon by
lunar winds.
"There aren't any lunar winds."
"Are you telling me... because of the vacuum... the very absence of air...
that the moon is windless? I don't believe it!"
"I've heard that, it must be true! Not a breeze!"
"Nothing! Not a breeze!"

big penis rock hard balls joy ride history of the world

teenage boys drive big penises and wear big penis ornaments and we're all 
pushing our tiny penises around the playing field or looking for a rhyme 
to hid our tiny penises while we arm ourselves with big penis guns and 
missiles all pointy and the like to kill big and little penises anywhere 
we can, we want to be the only penises in sight and we want our tiny 
penises hidden but our big penis houses and big giant penis top-fuel 
dragsters in sight so we can raise big-penis fear while we stain books and 
canvas with big penis smearings while our tiny penises throb and shake,

Cryptic Philosophy of Dispersion


Reification as false consciousness in relation to mediation of labor

BUT commodities in relation to exchange-value are transformed into
fields of exchange - the ontology of commodities becomes a process-
ontology (as opposed to state)

Statements are reification / residue - their communality establishes
virtual community (all communities are virtual)

Commodities and statements are field phenomena (re: Minsky, mind)

(Field phenomena are virtual) (Processes are virtual)

BUT what do we mean by virtual?

Processes and communities are measurable through verification 
procedures inhabiting inscriptions

Don't all verification procedures inhabit inscriptions?

What constitutes the MATERIAL SUBSTRATE of verification?

One can imagine an OBJECT, but one can also imagine a REPORT

OBJECTS REPORT

Inscriptions are REPORTS OF REPORTS

REPORTS SPLIT into constituent syntactical elements

Semantics : MATERIAL SUBSTRATE :: syntactics : INHABITED INSCRIPTIONS

Rewriting Marx via Lukacs: "A commodity is therefore not a thing at all. 
The social character of human labor appears to us as an objective 
character stamped upon processes which problematize the very concept of 
objective character. Social relations are smeared among processes and 
consciousnesses, among the social and a hypothetical objectivity. Not 
commodities, but commodification is simultaneously perceptible and 
imperceptible, and commodification undermines the very concept of 'thing' 
as well as 'ding an sich.' The relationships among humans and processes 
are incapable of disentanglement; we are far from the techne of Marx and 
classical reification of Lukacs."

Rewriting Foucault: "Concepts such as discontinuity, rupture, threshold, 
limit, series, and transformation all characterize, not only the analogic 
and digital, but the liminal regions of consciousness and physicality 
inhabiting (not existing within) the virtual. Now we can call 'formula- 
tion' the individual or collective process that construes signs, signing, 
tagging, and/or inscription (keeping in mind that THE VIRTUAL IS ALWAYS 
INSCRIPTION). Formulation, if an event at all, is a smeared or stained 
process which can never be localized (located by its spatio-temporal 
coordinates); it need not relate to an author, issue from an author (real 
or virtual or bot or any Other/other); if one insists that formulation is 
performative, then one must also insist that THE WORLD ITSELF IS PERFORM- 
ATIVE. There is no getting around the sign, getting around with it; it is 
easier than one might think to get around without it."

"_Letter Deity._ Then, think that [the mind realizing the ultimate deity] 
appears in the sky in the aspect of the written letters of the mantra of 
the appropriate deity. Think that the mind having the aspect of [realis- 
ing] the suchness of oneself and the deity as undifferentiable has become 
a moon disc and that on it [the letters] are set in order [the sounds of 
the letters mixing with the form] like very pure mercury adhering [that 
is, mixing completely with] grains of gold. This is the letter deity." 
(Tsong-ka-pa, The Yoga of Tibet, The Great Exposition of Secret Mantra, 
trans. Jeffrey Hopkins.)

Akasa (space, principle of accommodation): "Akasa ever remains untouched 
by dust and darkness. Dust and darkness appear and disappear; they are 
contingent; but akasa ever remains as it is. They are not anything that 
itself arises and perishes, nor do they ever become dirty; not becoming 
dirty they cannot even be said to have become pure, for they never were 
impure; in truth they lie beyond the determinate natures of pure and 
impure. They ever remain untouched by dust and water." (Reworked from 
Nagarjuna's Philosophy as presented in The Maha-Prajnaparamita-Sastra, K. 
Venkata Ramanan.)

Begin with singularities within a classical Wittgenstein (TLP) / Hertz 
axiomatic tradition; subtract the logicism; liquify the singularities; 
channel them through Waddington's chreods; channel them through hierarchic 
networks; channel them through holarchic networks; eliminate the nodes and 
channels; transform the liquidity into dust-motilities; transform the 
dust-motilities into radiations; transforms the traditions into groundless 
flux-processes; whirl the flux-processes around the interned memory of 
singularities and axiomatics; report back to the reports; report nowhere; 
whirl the flux-processes around the reports; remember deaths and annihila- 
tions; whirl the deaths, the annihilations...

Ground Plain

Smaller crystal radio (double-tap single coil) fed directly into the mike 
input of my laptop, then filtered with CoolEdit. Nothing but ground hum 
and static was picked up; these were modified into a semblance of ontol- 
ogy. Clearly there are impedance mismatches at work and ground problems 
resulting from the general radiation spewing of the laptop. The result as 
usual is interesting soundwork, but the coiling itself, running the power 
grid into and out of the earth, conjures an impossible mythos; this 60- 
cycle would already be otherwise throughout most of Europe, half of Japan 
for example.

It occurs to me that someone or some thing is speaking just around the 
corner, or coroner, given the propensity of the dead to inhabit anything 
but the clear evidence of the living. So there's plenty of room for a 
poetics of ground-space grid-space, provided both of them are at least 
somewhat subservient to the corporate powers that provide the thrumming in 
the first place.

You know, the whole world is electrified, humming along on whatever funda- 
mentals occur from region to region - and their respective additions, sub- 
tractions, etc., pretty Lissajous figures all.

So we've joined the fish with their electric organs, not to mention the 
effects of insect wings on very low frequency radio reception - such 
effects perhaps on each other as well.

Still, given the ground and ground plane and hum's ubiquity, we're mostly 
listening to ourselves listening to ourselves. The 'said' rides the 
current like obscene outriggers, even though it's the riding we care for 
as we face one another over any distance greater than a few meters. And 
perhaps even less than that distance as well.

Shadow sounds

Loose-coupled crystal radio fed into 96hz Zoom H2 recorder; the .wavs
were then processed for subterranean information. Processing included
stretching 400%, notch filtering to eliminate 60hz, hard limiting and
normalizing, noise or signal elimination, added echo. I approached 
dreams. There was enough headroom in the 96hz signal to embrace them.

Soon we will stretch lightning, thunder; then we will hear the proper
mapping of the earth. Think of the instantaneity of a virtual particle
spread into a packet of unknown shape, carrying the shadows of the 
cosmos themselves. In the meantime we have the following:

VICTORIA http://www.asondheim.org/victoria.mp3

long harmonica solo on Hohner Victoria harmonica;
this is from 1901 and unusual - there are no sound-holes,
creating a soft 'velvet' sound
(a long form replete with errors, working myself into and 
out of corners, pretending everything was/is perfect)



Grim(e) Day

This has been a grim day. Whenever I speak with my father, his hatred 
manages to hit home. From his viewpoint I'm a failure. He's been paying my 
health insurance; otherwise I'd die which might not be that much of a dis- 
pleasure to him. Thinking about this there were voices in my head which 
managed to expand into a world I prayed was out there, but am certain was 
just going on between cortex and ego. Yes, things manage to leap ontolo- 
gies just like that, the sign of madness. I listened to crystal, worked on 
rearrangement, all those voices spewed into the aether through systems of 
coils echoing one another, http://www.asondheim.org/echocoils.mp3 . I 
began to recognize the mockery of dissonance, played music and toppled the 
line upon itself with echos and delays as I thought what to do next, in 
the meantime beginning world-building once again with universal harmony, 
http://www.asondheim.org/universalharmony.mp3. By this time I was raging 
in tears fighting myself repeatedly, not that my health has been in good 
shape, it hasn't. I'm as far from my family as an event horizon filled 
with nothing worthwhile. I curled into myself. I curled farther into 
myself, I thought myself monad, I thought myself rage, I thought myself 
consort, I stopped thinking, I began again with the harmony of monads 
purring softly in molecular air, http://www.asondheim.org/harmonady.mp3 , 
open the windows, monads and let the soft flow healing in, the curing of 
rage against the selves swells to uncanny beauties that never makes the 
pain worthwhile.
