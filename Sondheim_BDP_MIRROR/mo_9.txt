speech of the assassin





we begin to arm ourselves

this is not a joke

prepare for war to come

prepare for bullet in the heart



i am a refugee hiding out in america

everything i think stems from war

already a century old, energy and suicides

trapped and hiding in america, where are guns,

the riots hiding in america, where is energy,

the flower's iron petals, the bodies hanging on the edge

can't think beyond, mechanism without electronics,

third-world newsreels, network implosions

bodies dissipated into bodies, no hope for america

smashed, afraid of everything

culture, knowledge, worlds of identities,

thefts and fabrications of identities, our murder-rape

let me tell you, comprehension is useless, only violence

remaining, gatherings of storms, the furies

and the horror, gunships gathered above,

drills beneath the ground, exposing rage,

smashing rage, decades of inactivity, violence against

innocent, we are all innocent, we will carry guns

i am hiding in america, have been hiding in america, i abjure

citizenship, watch voting-theft, rights-theft, land and water

theft, body theft, bone-and-marrow theft,,

smashed remnants, ornamented colonialisms flowered

with american bombs, they will fear me, fear the attack

from below, the vertical gun, the fury of anti-gravitation,

bomb and shrapnel, there will be capitols at the mercy of moles,

bombers against bombers, ruined limbs in piles, dead presidents,

blind animals, forests cut like flesh, annihilation

until we disappear, hiding out in america, we do our part, we

disappear together, we forget our names, we write from nothing,

we write from nothing



let us lead our enemies into temptation.

let them die with the fury of their hideous violence.



there will be a day we disappear.

we take up arms, we disappear.

we disappear, we take up arms.

brothers and sisters, we take up arms.
