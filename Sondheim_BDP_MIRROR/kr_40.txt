broken paragraph


i am not a very nice person, i would like to be a nice person, but i can-
not be a nice person. i am too vulnerable to words snaking into my cave,
taking over my avatars, eating away at the breast of complacency. what can
i do, i must listen to the wires, speaking in many voices. they cancel
each other out, make mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.... machinic (but who decides a
machine, determines the machine, programs the machine, defines the mach-
ine, and why not an organ or an organism) or multiplexing roar that never
resolves. on the other side, far side, when desperate calls for help go
unheeded, tell me about kitty genovese, don't name kitty genovese, kitty
genovese dies, no one calls the police, she's being murdered, while noise
screams in neighbors' heads
