Emily's Riddle


There is a large house many storeys high, without doors.  Built of wood
and stone and brick, it withstands the strongest storms. The windows are
curtained or otherwise obscured (perhaps they are fogged over); one can
see almost nothing of the dark interior. No sound or light emerges from
within; no one has been seen looking out, half-hidden behind the shades.
The house is without electricity, gas, water and sewer; apparently unin-
habited, it seems nonetheless well kept up. The pathways around it are
clean, the sidewalks immaculate. Lovely rose gardens grow nearby; these,
too, seem unattended, but are always neat.

What is this house and who is the gardener?
























The house is the past, and God is the gardener.
