WORLD


"It's based on the two World texts (World and World ii) I wrote recently, 
about a philosophical phenomenology of string theory, particularly in 
relation to text. The two World texts come at the end of the attached 
text. Above, are various code/work manipulations of the texts - as you go 
from the beginning, incoherence of style transforms into coherence of 
content. In other words, the later portions are 'easier' to read than the 
earlier. The whole embodies a world or Worlding, an attempt to contain 
meaning and syntax which are leaking out in all directions." 

(From an email. I quite like this piece I wrote for a chapbook; it turned
out to be somewhat long. Enjoy hopefully! - Alan)

World

String theory knocks a loop into analog/digital, nothing remains certain 
that is one way or another, what occurs can be read accordingly pre/sent 
or sent/from. Holographic theory knocks a loop into ding-an-sich, / Ding 
an sich Ding an sich is unknowable though certainly /: The roads to the 
visible real are tortured, one can't say anything. This is the dead-end of 
philosophy, with the exception of the social - you have justice and ethics 
beneath the aegis of situational heuristics, but one ultimately appeals at 
best to primatology without teleology or theology. What happens to the 
episteme, epistemology, around the circuits of a black hole? The ontology 
of strings and information scattered (presented, coded, irretrievable) 
might as well devolve into mathesis where ideality itself is problematic: 
At the end of the day, nothing remains, but everything is present; nothing 
is everything, and so forth. The broken ontology of the middle way is 
broken in another and more radical way: Nothing can be said, because what 
there is, is literally unsayable. Try translating equation into language, 
language into everyday doxa, dark matter into descriptors, descriptors 
into primitives, primitives into foundations. Give it a go: That the movie 
we watch is ourselves watching the movie, that projection is sourceless, 
that every four vector carries the potential of an imaginary. There's no 
'it' to go farther than this: We are the dream-screen of an unconscious 
universe, no matter how far, how many conventions, dimensions. Convention: 
What we call as a past posterior. Accountability: Unaccountability. It's 
the knife-edge of good things in catastrophe theory transmuted through 
classicism into the anthropic principle, mythos of origins. Cause and 
effect: Scattered. Hallucinated projections named 'real' by hallucinated 
projections. The buildup of dimensions, topologies, branes, dark-matter, 
virtualities: No buildup at all, the baroque edifice of something given 
meaning by something naming by some fantasm or an other. Membrane/brane 
among Planck's lengths, masses, times, embedded seethed or froths as if 
non-embedded. You can always: Add, subtend, augment, the pressure of 
mathesis, eventually loose consistencies, heuristics, seem to dominate: 
The four-color theorem as example. What of this? In the small: Classical 
logics, set theories, Ptolemy and Kepler: Reductions because math can do 
that. Divide and spread, emit, spew, sourceless, targetless, broiling, 
then what might be phenomenologies of coagulations: Maybe Wolfram's 
automata giving shrift to these, cells falling apart, failing, location- 
less. So we're: Present and accounted for as-if 'among us': Therefore a 
literary as if 'object and process' or one or another ontology, creaky but 
functional epistemologies: As long as the hallucinogenic withdraws, 
'doesn't look too close,' as if 'there were looking,' as if 'there were a 
ground of one sort or another,' of which: None of these, they're knot

Fields appear to have no touch, nothing germane to the body; one thinks of 
action at a distance because distance seems emptied. Heat transgresses for 
example; nothing happens in mediated space. Magnetism implies qualitative 
distinction; the field attracts or repels, depending on polarity and just
what is brought into the vicinity. An approach may be +/0/-; two out of 
three attract. Epistemologically, ontologically, difference is drawn out - 
here is something out of the ordinary, perhaps non-Aristotelian, who 
knows? In any case, it's neither 'spirit' nor a thing of the world, 
although clearly it is of the world, within the world, part and parcel of 
the real. No hands push or pull the metal; were it not so common, it would 
be miracle, but it seems to 'come along with' everything familiar. Even 
boundary is contradicted, and one might be sure that the attractive 
impulse, presence, is there, even in the absence of the Other. It just 
_is._ This should, except for that familiarity, already have signaled a 
break, bringing the edifice of thing and logic down. How is space and time 
- how is space-time - when something so common is there that is not within 
as an object is within, that is not graspable, except by effect? Energy 
already seems something other than the world's thinging, yet just as 
concrete. It's not far from these considerations to an aporia of three- 
dimensionality, not to mention mass, image, light, heat, all those spatial 
fillings that seem neither possessed of projection or ordinary physical- 
ity. The clues are there, have been there. Yet again, the dream is an 
Other whose ontology isn't simply a mapping for or against a real (which, 
yes, might be the dream itself) - we're back where we startled from, 
making harmony and fit where none exists in the life-world, where bridges 
are ad-hoc at best, still taking on the characteristics of extensions and 
truth. Then there's dirt, filth; I remember Socrates' bypassing mud as 
ideality - already a fly in the ointment. What simmers beneath the surface 
isn't just abjection; it's also froth, roil, wisp, membrane, magma, clay, 
plasma, species productions and particle rains. And it's here that the 
dissolution of things is the clearest, that humans are capable of tempor- 
arily reining-in, a momentary act of meaning-generation. Yet we're invaded 
by our knowledge; our projection bodies are processing, in the process of, 
corrosion, of being-vanquished, of always already disappearance of memory 
and noise. When lines are drawn, analog/digital, they're dependent on an 
alien phenomenology of potential wells: Existence is always bypassed, and 
bypassing characterizes existence. Fielding and being slough and incohere; 
to be sure there are formings and swarmings and no one can say much more.
