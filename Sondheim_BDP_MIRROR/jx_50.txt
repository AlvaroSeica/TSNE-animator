Nervousness produces 0/spew, 0-ing on on its/elf, extended library files,
each containing 0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0, each byte bit, configurations which,
given a careful historiography, _might_ be considered a suite of opera-
tions, whose defining characteristics and origins were recuperable.
Thought considers those convex operations of positioning, 0 * 0, 0 + 0,
concatenation, substitution, without inversions or the potential for
higher-order procedures such as 0 ^ 0. 

Nervousness produces chains, 0 + 0 + (0 + 0) * 0, perhaps even to the
extent of subtraction as the least common, 0 - 0 - 0 and so forth; here a
plenitude has already announced itself, spewing forth without considera-
tion of chain-length or file size.

It is comforting to know that the operations of normalization and absorp-
tion lend themselves to a certain therapeutic, perfect-tetris remaining at
constant speed, checks with a board large enough for perfect avoidance.
Like Yoko Ono's artwork with white pieces on both sides, a stream occurs
that flattens affect, contains all the sense and nonsense of the world,
and comfortably sutures the subject in eternal transference.

( For example:
0 + 0 - 0 + (0 * 0 * 0 * 0 * 0) - 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0
(0 * 0) - 0 - 0 - 0 * (0 * 0) = 0 
and so forth. )
