remember

http://www.asondheim.org/combtomb.gif
this is the one of the crenellated towers in the spectrum created
from a comb filter produced by the reading of a nineteenth-century comb
remember it turned three-dimensional with the spectrum
but still retains a relationship to the crystal palace or crystal 
cathedral
remember you forgot to remove the coordinates
http://www.asondheim.org/fetremake.jpg
this began as the fetish.jpg remember it was taken from a digital image 
made in the miami apartment shooting up from the ground with a flash
azure and i wearing robes this one is me and the robe was parted by 
the erection like the tent of abraham was it
that image elsewhere then taken through a floyd-steinberg filter 
that changes it into something like photogravure which was then sent
through photoshop
remember at first everything became messier or relatively confused
but then you applied the neon filter which lit up the edges and after
a while the result then was faded
remember you tried different kinds of fading and this one worked
turning it back into an odd three-dimensionality all the the while
you're feeling ill and feverish with a bad allergic attack and more
think it might be the flu in any case you worked through the difference
fade and then intensified the saturation and upped the curves a bit
resulting in this dream of broken lust something like jelinek 
might have written in a still image from one of her bleaker novels

i have to get another text out there
nothing will survive if this one isn't included
others are behind me this one isn't
this is one that will survive me if i only get it out there
if you read it or not read it if it is included if it is out there
something out there i feel ill today
i feel ill today and have for the past several days
i may not get another one this one must survive out there
no mistake about it out there is really there
no mistake either out there is not in here not at all not at all

the world is a world of replete suffering fecundity of pain
not buddhist pain pain pure and simple debilitating pain
pain of utmost savagery we do what we can we contribute
pain could be autonomic no feeling but reaction the organism survives
survives peacefully fighting off the intrusion from within and without
the natural world follows no such leads follows no leads at all
pain is irrelevant to the suffering mind only a signal
if the signal close down mind the organism makes way for others
others and betters if the pain is so intense so furious
we do what we can in this regard of furious pain
the elimination of our species will eliminate one iota of the world's pain
we can do no better we are of the most violent we should know better
destroying everything in our path crawling towards armageddon
animals and plants all the narrows will be open wide and poisoned
our minds are the worlds shit we dig from the earth with furious teeth
with teeth of iron slash flesh from eyes and stomachs in animal fun
how else shall we know what we are made of we alone feel pain
we will survive momentarily no longer that is fine
the faster we go the longer for beginning others
perhaps waiting just around the corner they're already dying
lateness of the hour a bad joke

On Code and Codework


Consider a well-defined entity x, and its complement -x. Then x^-x = N, 
the null set. Consider a second entity y and -y, y^-y = N. Think Nx and 
Ny, the null set relativized to x and y. Consider three separable entities 
x, y, z, and take pairs xy, yz, zx. These are symmetrical yx, zy, xz. Let 
ab stand for a^b. Then xy, yz, zx are equivalent to null. Let x, y, z 
divide a planar region into three regions bordering on each other. Let x@y 
represent a line equidistant from the entities x and y. Then x@y, y@z, z@x 
all meet at a single point. Divide the plain so that all entities are 
grouped in triads; each triad meets in a single point. Divide the plain so 
that these single points are grouped in triads and so forth. What branches 
are available? Is a single point reached? To operate with x and -x such 
that x^-x = N is to operate with discrete entities common to distributive 
aristotelian logic. Now consider a second set, X, Y, etc., mapped onto the 
first; the mapping may be one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one. If the 
first, the resulting mapping is reversible. If the second, it is 
reversible but the coding itself is not reversible. If the third, the 
mapping is not reversible; the result is a set of possibilities, not a 
single one. Codes are mappings. There are two types of codes, declarative 
and performative. An example of the former is Morse; it is one-to-one, but 
all that is produced is equivalence. An example of the second is Perl; 
Perl codes procedure. If procedure is coded, then the contents of the 
procedure are doubly coded. If a Perl program parses {A} to produce {B}. 
then the primary coding is the program which constructs and orders 
procedures. The secondary coding is {A} -> {B} which may be considered the 
semantic plane of the code. In Eco's A Theory of Semiotics, only a rule 
'may properly be called a '_code._' and a rule couples items from one 
system with some from another. Eco extends the possibility of code to 'a 
set of possible _behavioral responses_ on the part of the destination. 
This is performativity. In codework, primary and secondary coding are 
entangled. Entanglement may be considered noise in the system. With noise, 
the null set N is blurred across fuzzy sets with parasitic inputs; x^-x 
and x^y may be and usually are ill-defined. It is this ill-definition - 
which functions for example in current definitions of words like 'freedom' 
- that tends towards political economy. Political, because culture and the 
social are at stake in relation to the definition which is always already 
under contestation, and economy, because there are limited resources and 
examples for any particular definition. With codework, meaning itself is 
problematized as a result of entanglement. In Eco, it is the code which 
reaches a destination, not the message. The decoding of the message may or 
may not be equivalent to the source. Noise is always already present and 
is considered within the channel. This is the T-model of the parasite 
described by Serres. Eco states "When a code apportions the elements of a 
conveying system to the elements of a conveyed system, the former becomes 
the expression of the latter, and the latter becomes the content of the 
former. A sign-function arises when an expression is correlated to a 
content, both the correlated elements being the functives of such a 
correlation.' Code is a collocation or system (not necessarily the same) 
of processes; processes are performative; both are temporally-embedded. A 
mapping f(x) = y is not temporally-embedded; thus the mapping of the even 
numbers onto the number system may be considered an ideality which _is,_ 
regardless of temporal processes. The structure is given all-at-once 
within the formula (and its proof); its proof is a carrying-out of the 
truth-value, or a revealing of the truth-value, of the structure. There 
are mappings which are systemic, i.e. structure-dependent, and there are 
mappings which are non-systemic or purely heuristic, such as randomly 
assigning letters in a message to a triple number (page/line/letter- 
position) originating from a particular edition of a particular book. In 
all of these instances, of course, terms like 'system' and 'assign' are 
themselves fuzzy; nevertheless there's a tremendous difference between the 
anecdotal and the structural, and there are practical differences in the 
ensuing codes and their employment. Peter Gardenfors, in Conceptual Space, 
The Geometry of Thought, considers 'conceptual spaces' which are related 
to tessellation of the plane. This reminds one of Peirce's simplest mathe- 
matics, which is also related to Venn diagrams; in all of these, sets of 
entities and concepts in the life-world are mapped into other spaces which 
may or may not reflect thinking processes. Geometry is always bound by its 
spatial representations; there is no reason to think, at all, that the 
mind necessarily works through spatial or any representation for that 
matter. Representation is always coded; Sebeok, in Approaches to Animal 
Communication, 'Semiotics and Ethology,' points out that the 'model 
suggested here entails a communication unit in which a relatively small 
amount of energy or matter in an animal (a) the source, brings about a 
relatively large redistribution of energy or matter in another animal (or 
in another part of the same animal), (b) the destination, and postulates 
(c) a channel through which the participants are capable of establishing 
and sustaining contact. Maturana somewhere talks about such communication 
as the mutual orienting of cognitive domains. Sebeok states that 'Every 
source requires a transmitter which serves to reorganize, by a process 
called encoding, the messages it produces into a form that can be 
understood by the destination. The source and the destination are 
therefore said to fully, or at least partially, share (d) a code, which 
may be defined as that set of transformation rules whereby messages can be 
converted from one representation to another.' As long as one sticks to 
transformation rules, code is always procedural. Sebeok states that 'The 
string generated by an application of a set of such rules is (e) a 
message, which may thus be considered an ordered selection from a 
conventional set of signs.' I think that 'ordered' is problematic as well, 
since there is clearly a qualitative difference between book-ordering as 
described above, and a set of rules based on mathesis. Where does the 
arbitrary come in? One might say - and this is an important principle - 
that the content of a code itself is directly correlated to its 
arbitrariness. In this sense, the measure of a code is related to the 
entropy of information within the process of encoding. The greater the 
degree of the arbitrary, the more difficult to break, the greater the 
entropy and therefore the greater the degree of information within it. 
This is not on the level of the double-level of the code, i.e. the content 
it operates upon, if there is such content (as in the Perl example above), 
but within encoding itself. Every encoding is an encoding of encoding; if 
the encoding is fully realized by the product of the code, then its 
semantic content / information is low. If Morse encodes a message, more 
than likely the message may be decoded based only on the distribution of 
letters. The Morse content is low. If a book is used, the decoding is 
increasingly difficult and the content of the code is high. This is also 
related to issues of redundancy vis-a-vis Shannon and Weaver. Note that a 
message and its destination are irrevocably ruptured; there is no 
guarantee that an equivalence is attained on any level. Code operates more 
often than not on an ontological plane disassociated, or associated by 
intention only, with both its source and its decoding; there is no 
guarantee that the source and the message-at-its-destination have anything 
in common. There is no guarantee of the coherency of the practice of 
coding in a particular case, no guarantee of one-to-one or one-to-many or 
many-to-one, no guarantee of a zero-parasite-demographics - no guarantee 
that the channel, in fact, has not been derailed altogether, as often 
happens with bacteriophages. Bateson, in Bateson and Ruesch, Communica- 
tion, The Social Matrix of Psychiatry, states 'codification must, in the 
nature of the case, be systematic. Whatever objects or events or ideas 
internal to the individual represent certain external objects or events, 
there must be a systematic relationship between the internal and the 
external, otherwise the information would not be useful.' Today one can 
say, 'otherwise the information might not be useful,' since it is 
precisely in the breakdown of systematic relationships that innovation 
emerges.' But meaning may be produced even out of tautology. For example, 
propositional logic may be 'derived' from the Sheffer stroke, 'not both A 
and B'; it can also be derived from its dual, 'neither A nor B.' What can 
we say about these? Only that they represent, as processes or _cullings_ 
of particular bounded universes, an unbinding/unbounding - 'neither A nor 
B' points elsewhere altogether, and 'not both A and B' points either 
elsewhere or towards an underpinning of union. At the heart of this 
reduction of propositional logic, is a tendency towards dispersion, 
towards wandering, the nomadic, even though the symbols within the 
calculus proper are completely mute. The Sheffer stroke and its dual, by 
the way, are related as well to the processes of inscription with which 
this essay began - for what is x^-x, than an _inscription_ of an entity, a 
process of coding (and all coding is inscription of one form or another) 
the real for the purposes of comprehension, a process that produces, not 
only meaning, but _all the meaning there is._ There is no outside to the 
sememe, just as there is no landscape without a viewpoint. In this sense 
we are bounded, and bound to be bounded. I want to acknowledge and take 
responsibility for interpretations here which are necessarily shallow and 
possibly misrepresentations as well; this is true in particular of 
Gardenfors' book which is complex, and which I have just begun. I have 
found the concept of conceptual spaces of use here, as a way of thinking 
through code, process, representation, sememe, Eco's planes of expression 
and content, etc.; but I do not yet understand it within Gardenfors' 
theory. I have also completely neglected what I think is most necessary, a 
detailed typology of codes, taking for example temporality into and out of 
account in various ways. I cannot see how one can proceed without a deep 
reading of Eco's 'Theory of Codes' which is the major section of A Theory 
of Semiotics. In the same book, Eco develops a typology of sign production 
which is quite useful. Other references might be Barthes' S/Z (although I 
constantly find his poeticizing beautiful and problematic), and a quite 
useful early book, Symbol Formation, An Organismic-Developmental Approach 
to Language and the Expression of Thought, Werner and Kaplan, Wiley, 1963. 
Finally, it is clear from all of the above that at best one can sketch a 
_discursive field,_ complete with intensifications themselves representing 
concepts; this is similar to a loosely-structured Wittgensteinian family 
of usages. 'Code,' like 'game,' is always a strategy and a wager from a 
theoretical viewpoint, and like much such viewpoints, everything and 
nothing is at stake. One would hope for a future of usefulness, politics, 
and aesthetics to emerge; the danger, in relation to 'codework' itself, is 
that a style develops, and that the uneasy underpinnings - which at least 
for me are the most interesting aspects of it - eventually disappear, 
absorbed back into issues of genre, etc. Code, like the processes of 
postmodernity, is always in a state of renewal, whether or not the 'type' 
or 'concept' remains, and at stake within this renewal is our interpreta- 
tion of the world itself - our actions and our 'reading' of being and 
beings. Wittgenstein's 'silence' at the end of the Tractatus is code's 
success, not failure; it is the always already of the always already, but 
not its foundation.
