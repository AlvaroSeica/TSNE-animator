Barometer


Feverish, I wake up in the middle of the night, sit stark naked at laptop
station, dial in world, hoping your singular eye emerges cyclopian from
central screen.* Temperature rises as lid opens, gauges, precise shame of
sheen of skin, offered to you, knocking at the door, banging on the ceil-
ing, banging on the floor. Even the crevices unfold, dreary flesh plain,
extinctions, survivals. 

Shame is an occurrence of the worlds' barriers, inability to carry _this_
meaning-skin into the zone of physical life, doubled doors locked down-
stairs, holding the world at bay. World, you know who I'm talking to.

Admitted to a friend I could not, for first time, begin to create a date
or meeting or occurrence, would have no idea how to talk with someone in
that space where things fall. I had blanket and tea, watched our videos as
her concerns with dis/ease translated into my dis/ease of the virtual.
Temperature rising, the skin falls from my bones. Come eat, I would say
that watching the good meat suppurate, huddled in CPU, hard drive / down
to the floor.

A woman said hello to me on the street today, that building tumbled to the
ground, burning roof. I was ashamed of myself.
