the platform dance "Eyebeam" done for all the "swells" in the

abstract animated avatar maquette 
the holes open to one another or not at all
the bodies are crimped, collapsed, coagulated
the bodies crash and crumble without destiny
it's as if the holes puckered and faltered
and they might slosh what might be there
pure gifts from one to another 
there's no happiness without exchange
there's no grief without collapse
the holes no longer speak or chatter
animated communities have no history
their history's left behind
monotony... monotony...
but there's always an echo in the hollow
where a letter lies sleeping

when all is abandoned, when i die before my time
the video which surrounds the others, the other,
the video which is a gift from the other to the
other and the video which is the seeing of some
of death to the world, unworlding beyond

when all is accepted, when she lives after my time
the video surrounded by the others, my self,
the video which is a gift from myself to the other,
and the video which is the seeing of some of life
in the world, among the worlds beyond

For Occupy Wall Street, Jesus' Third Way * 

Seize the moral initiative.
Find a creative alternative to violence.
Assert your own humanity and dignity as a person.
Meet force with ridicule or humor.
Break the cycle of humiliation.
Refuse to submit or to accept the inferior position.
Expose the injustice of the system.
Take control of the power dynamic.
Shame the oppressor into repentance.
Stand your ground.
Make the Powers make decisions for which they are not prepared.
Recognize your own power.
Be willing to suffer rather than retaliate.
Force the oppressor to see you in a new light.
Deprive the oppressor of a situation where a show of force is 
effective.
Be willing to undergo the penalty of breaking unjust laws.
Discard fear of the old order and its rules.
Seek the oppressor's transformations.

* This is in Walter Wink, Beyond Just War and Pacifism: Jesus'
Nonviolent Way, in Volume 4, Contemporary Views on Spirituality
and Violence, in The Destructive Power of Religion, Violence in
Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, J. Harold Ellens, Editor.
The articles in the four volumes are based on close theological
readings of texts, actions, and hermeneutics, and well worth 
reading. I think their relation to OWS is really useful.



Avatar / My Human Wounded in Time and in Space

My Avatar / Human Wounded in Space and in Time

this is what happens in the real world when you're eyes
are closed by others or you agree not to witness the horror
you were born into, you didn't ask for this, this shuddering
in space and time, this uniqueness with its catch-basin of
nerves already ruptured and furious at the world,

this is what happens when you step out of line, when you
can't come clean, can't clarify, can't suck your clean and
proper body, this stuttering in time and in space, this
smear with its basket of nerves torn to pieces, screaming
at every other world than their own

Happy Thanksgiving -  12:55 PM  -  Limited

http://www.alansondheim.org/warning.mp4 

wrote and lost everything, just an accounting in the midst of Happy 
Thanksgiving, working on mss, for WVU Press and Continuum, the FireMuseum 
record out soon, articles due on RMB city in Second Life and a performance 
in SL as well in January, working with Foofwa during the first week of 
January w/ collaboration with Mark Skwarek and Slava towards the end, then 
a 2nd performance with Monika Weiss Feb.2-4, and next week, the Window 
Gallery using crystal radios, guitar amp, the small models I made of 
distorted avatars and hopefully an accompanying video if I can quickly get 
the format right, no idea what that should really be. it feels emptied out 
with the deaths, flood, embezzlement, family split (which at this point I 
don't want to heal, just want to get over it). the Eyebeam scheduling was 
arcane and I hope it's actually fixed at this point so I can start working 
on various ideas here and there. I worry I'm a burden on everyone, like 
James Ellroy with his hushhush always going on in the background. i make 
short and simple videos here, still in Aurora Colorado, at least for 
myself; there aren't any comments at all for these. One of these, New York 
Woman, is a recap of an older audiotape, as embarrassing now as it was 
then, Reading Wilfred Owen, Ellens' The Destructive Power of Religion, 
Confederacy of Dunces, a book on cactus identification, a book on the 
Korean komungo, watching the news, keeping my mouth shut about the 
right-wing swirls of local tv. More and more I think that nature in fact 
really is red in tooth and claw, suffering and dissolution are the two 
positives of the world. I take walks and photographs around the nature 
preserve/reservoir and capture the encroaching mansions everywhere, 
devouring energy and any other resources they can find. Sometimes a hawk 
and new sparrows. The sky is steadfast blue, Around the world, there's no 
Thanksgiving and people are suffering. OWS lost almost all their library; 
books are trash in this world. I keep going back reading Dendy's 
Philosophy of Mystery and making calls, trying to connect to my friends, 
to keep them my friends in spite of all my faults. I stare into the dark. 
The dark doesn't stare back. In Pennsylvania, the house we grew up in is 
slowly collapsing. I inherit two antique guns and two antique swords. The 
world no longer needs them. Like 2 seconds ago Collapse this post

nothing's under them. when in doubt, swell.
neither penis nor vagina will do. too ripe.
breasts hearken back to the old days.
the old days listen in the imperative mode.
stone hears stone. oh for swollen breasts.
the earth heaves. no, the earth was heaved.
nothing's under them. when in doubt, swell.


on the move

Fi and Michael on the move, crossing themselves out,
the door open, and Fi and Michael are on the move;
we've waited for these moments of empathy and love,
waited for years; they're on a plane, they're doomed
to repetition. Fi and Michael don't know that; each
is new to them, their emotions opening like flowers;
they don't know each time is like the first or last,
all looped and circular, always the same opening,
they don't know that, we do, we do, we do.
http://www.alansondheim.org/burnotice.mov

Blue Skies as I am on the move, separated by encounters,
the beatings of the heart of the machine, and breathless
Blue Skies, they are so simple, they are so profound,
and like them, pulling us along, we are profound as well,
pulsing with empathy and love, these encounters coming,
fitfully, to an end, like flowers, like love, like Fi
and Michael, unlooping.

1-2 'fossil' outlines of wounded avatars on 3d printer plates 
3-7 crystal radio setups. the silver-black RCA BP-10 radio was the
first real portable (vacuum tube) from 1939-41. The loop antenna 
is used with the crystal sets. Better, the ribbon loop antenna on
the shelf in 3 was used. A variometer and early antenna tuner-
condenser are also visual. The sound was loud and clear; a large
number of stations and background sounds were received. This will
be amplified by a modern guitar amplifier.
