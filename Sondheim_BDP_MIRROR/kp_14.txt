Thats all it is. Give the cigarette to the girl. Shell put it out on
him. Like those circles, eh. You might not in the morning. What do you say
honey. Come on speak up. Wasnt there some time in your life you just had
one thing you wanted to do and youd die to do it. More than anything in
your life and you just thought about it all the time. Im not kiddin. Id
lie awake at nights thinkin of it. Open your mouth wider boy. Act like
you enjoy it. Life doesnt get any cheaper. "Life doesnt get any cheaper."


I read this somewhere on the net. You can find anything there. Its what
you pay for when youve got nothin better to do. Its what jumps on you when
your dreamin. You cant control it, you got to have it. Sometimes I lie
away at nights thinkin of it. This thing I got to have.
