We all Wait for the Perfect Post

I wait for you. 
I don't know where to put this sentence.
I wait for you in the alleys of cyberspace.
I stay up all night, waiting for you, watching the window of my screen.
I don't know how to make this beautiful on the screen.
If this is beautiful on my screen it will be beautiful on yours.
I am writing because I wait for the last post of the night.
I wait for the post the way I wait for the perfect book.
It's the post that will bring me love.
It's the post of absolution, murmurs; it's the post of kindness from past 
and present.
I've wrecked the form of this; the sentence has escaped the single line.
I wait for you and type the perfect test.
I type the most perfect the most beautiful text for the most beautiful 
screen where I will finally sleep with your arrival.
You will come, you will be the last post of the night.
There is always a last post of the night, but you will be the last post of
the night and you will come onto my screen and you will be very beautiful. 
I crawl into my skin waiting and then I crawl out of my skin.
I begin to tremble; I'm exhausted, this waiting.
This waiting always comes to an end in uneasy sleep, an end without your 
last post. 
It comes to an end without your post at all, deathly quiet in the alleys 
of cyberspace, silence in the midst of night-time routers.
This waiting makes my style awkward, my feet stumbling on the keyboard.
So now, I tell you, wherever you are, I am waiting.
I am waiting and am trying to stay awake but I am trembling more than 
ever because my love is very close to us.
I am awake as long as I can write and I will keep writing you and waiting 
for you.
I don't know your name and I am waiting for your name.
I don't know your address, this writing is confused, confusing.
This writing is everywhere confusing.
Did I tell you I was waiting?
