On a Sunday

 
Sun Sep 12 19:29:40 EDT 1999
i'm addicted to you, your holes, my tongue in you, tasting you, in your
ass, swallowing you, inhaling your interiors Sun Sep 12 19:30:42 EDT 1999
abandoned debris from your body entering mine, smashed protein, dna Sun
Sep 12 19:31:05 EDT 1999 returned in acid form, liquid-liquidated across
membraned interiors, swallowed growth as well, begging you for more, you
withdraw, hold yourself back from me, i dream your swollen interiors,
stillbirths, all of you in all of me Sun Sep 12 19:31:59 EDT 1999 churned
out elsewhere, new coverings for old, glistened memories shaved against
cleansed surfaces for the dermographia Sun Sep 12 19:32:50 EDT 1999 hot
breath on skins and touched and welted in the form of letters, no pain
really, emerging texts, my meals Sun Sep 12 19:33:20 EDT 1999 now swal-
lowed, the very open of the throat absorbing you Sun Sep 12 19:33:45 EDT
1999 shameful, covered with you, begging you for more, penetrating your
holes, swallowing your waste, liquid and solid, odor and scent Sun Sep 12
19:35:23 EDT 1999 turning into perfect rail or wire, turning around my-
self, what is rapt or rapture, ecstatic with full and swallowed mouth Sun
Sep 12 19:35:53 EDT 1999 please please open your holes to me i'm hungry
Sun Sep 12 19:37:08 EDT 1999                  

Sun Sep 12 19:29:41 EDT 1999
i am your plate, your toilet, your toaster, your hammer, your nail, your
implement, these things follow me on rusted wire banging on the road, i
walk down, forty kilometers in dirt, ruined wooden building in a field
dismal at the stormy end bearing your waste within me, carrying your in-
teriors, your abandoned dreams, your asides, your unconscious, your for-
gotten memories, all within Sun Sep 12 19:36:39 EDT 1999 please please
open your holes to me i'm thirsty
