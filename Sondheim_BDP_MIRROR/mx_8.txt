The Higher Pantheism in a Nutshell


One, who is not, we see: but one, whom we see not, this:
Surely this is not that: but that is assuredly is.

What, and wherefore, and whence? for under is over and thunder:
If thunder could be without lightning, lightning could be without under.

Doubt is faith in the main: but faith on the whole is without:
We cannot believe by proof: but could we believe doubt?

Why, and whither, and how? for barley and rye are not over:
Neither are straight lines curves: yet over is under and clover.

Two and two may be four: but four and four are not fate:
Fate and God may be twain: but God is the same thing as eight.

Ask a man what he thinks, and get from a man what he heels:
God, once caught in the fact, shows you a fair pair of feels.

Body and spirit are twins: God only knows which is ditch:
The soul squats down in the flesh, like a tinker drunk in a which.

More is the whole than a part: but half is more than the soul:
Clearly, the soul is the body: but is not the body the whole?

One and two are not one: but one and nothing is true:
Truth can hardly be false, if falsehood cannot be two.

Once the mastodon was: pterodactyls were common as ox:
Then the mammoth was God: now is He a prize cocks.

Parallels all things are: yet many of these are you:
You are certainly I: but certain I am not askew.

Springs the rock from the plain, shoots the stream from the cock:
Cocks exist for the hen: but hens exist for the rock.

God, whom we see not, is: and God, who is not, we dee:
Fiddle, we know, is didle: and diddle, we take it, is see.

Humanity Belief in Goodness


Humanity Belief in Goodness will bring all of us into an untimely end as 
no one will agree with one what Goodness is or even Belief. I think 
Goodness is not hurting but what if one in Humanity is hurting me. I think 
we are all in Humanity. Everyone will want to be Good but sometime we 
forget we want to be Good and then there are problems. What do we do then. 
I think I agree that Mr. Hussein forgot to do Good but when he would think 
he would laugh but sometime he would think about being Good. Mr. Bush 
thinks all the time I am doing Good and has his Belief. Mr. Hitler from 
long ago thinks all the time I am doing Good but he would not eat meat. 
Mr. Bush will eat meat. I do not think it is Good to eat meat because I do 
not Believe an animal will want that. We cannot ask the animal. If I could 
ask the animal I would know.

this turn of fate, this monument:: <::> this transformation
<==> you can meet her in the dark <::> it's the best 
place:: lit by the fires of the burning of the national archives -
koranic interlude - you can wait on the floor -
there are always times for bodies
i just got this guitar today
so I thought I might use it in the performance.
but then I don't think it would work
since I didn't plan ahead of time for a guitar
but I couldn't resist this one, it cost $40
(that's almost 40 Euros!!!!)
thank yoU! thank you!!!
can you hear me!
thank you!Q thank you!Q
the guitar cost forty Euros -
anyway....
on the left anja schmidt on the right foofwa d'imobilite
foofwa the immobilized -
whenever one moves, there's a relationship with an object
which is a three dimensional cauterization of the real

this is one of those objects - this isn't a joke -
embedded in time and space-varying projections
transforming him into an object - you're seeing the object

oh oh oh I'm beside myself now!
I"M BESIDE MYSELF NOW!
HEHEH!

so anyway - you're seeing the object up there on the screen
- which is in front of me and what if I couldn't type this fast?
I'd be at a loss
becauxe when you work three-dimensionally it's all,
not even object-oriented,
but it's the object itself - it'
s the object itself - going inside and outside of the object -
whatever happened to the body 0-
it moves through violent spaces
	EACH SPACE IS AN ARCHIVE
	EACH SPACE HOLDS ITS OWN AS AN ARCHIVE
	YOUI CAN'T IMAGINE, YOU JUST CAN'T IMAGINE..
	`	parameters...there are always
        parfameters movinag -moving - parameters at work
caressing the space
forcing you through it / into it
THIS IS THE SPACE OF ARCHIVES
THIS IS THE SPACE THAT WAS DESTROYED IN IRAQ
the space in which an object appears in fifty-thousand
or onehundredseventythousand forms and formats.
a FOREST OF SPACES AND APPEARANCES

information carried down to the molecujlar level
look on the LEFT - the viruses from SARS
look on the right - who or what is in the LAST STAGES -

SO WHEN YOU STUDY HITTITE
you learn in cuneiform that there are...
strata,l layers, images, viewpoints -
for example, you might want to write MY FATHER
which is my name in hebrew - avi - but you would
use Akkadian - in the middle of the Hittite - you'd
write ABU.YA - like that - you can see the resemblance, 
but the hittite's gone, just like it
s gone when sumerian or other forms, mitanni for example, 
start to take over - it's ALL a matter of layers and images -
and their destruction - their overt destruction.
what we need is something else - another form/at - for 
example the mouth - or a litany of plants and animals
and humans on the way to extinctions...
as plato would say - you get the IDEA....
Kant you understand?
by the way Florian is here, hello Florian! we were waiting...

which reminds me - that there are no end to them,
the protocols and codes and codecs and levelling,
no end at all to them....
so what you're seeing now... flattened images,
collapsed parameters - every image is already an imperialism,
a destruction - every image loses the memory of its creation....
thank you very much for coming and remember
that the war isn't over yet
that people and archives are being destroyed
that no protocol can rescue them
that everything is invaded from within
that i'm playing a guitar with five strings
that the six one is gone as in 'gone world' -

The Apparition


"Indeed, the apparition of order that was usually associated with
equilibrium phase transitions appears to be characteristic of systems far
from thermal eqiulibrium. This phenomenon, which was initially considered
as exceptional, appears now to be the rule in driven complex systems. Even
living organisms have long been considered as the result of chance rather

Astonishing.

It is astonishing.
How or what is astonishing.
It is full of wonder, the light beyond the characters.
The characters march. For each position, another name.
For each name, another character. Everyone its own.
I can't conceive of anything else. The plasmas and fires.
The bombs and debris. It's incomprehensible.
War returns the earth to the primordial. 
Enormous temperatures at the heart of bombs. Furious winds.
Nothing remains of stromatolite culture.
There are refugees. They live and wander.
Settle in deep salinity. Stare at nothing. The stars.
The moon. The vacant sun. Inconceivable, this blankness.
This blankness full of wonder. This astonishing.
The stromatolite is a character. Grounded in a pool.
Against the beach-edge. In-shore, off-shore.
I have a name and it is inconceivable. An instant.
The shortest possible time. The ephemera of transmission.
Ephemera of protocols. The chance of communication.
The imminence. It is astounding. The is.
