Phaedra

This is in the mountains. This is where one thinks through the thinking 
of truth. This is where you begin with one thing always.

At dusk rain falls.

Area: falls

You are on the path. There are stones, worn down by glaciers, surrounding 
you, and you hear a waterfall in the distance. Dense fog... The cries of 
a roc break the silence. A monk walks in the distance, chanting. It is a 
picture from the Sung.

Exits are:  peaks  pines  emptiness  Phaedra  

You are alone here
