Knot

Totalitarian temptation of unblemished skin: The photographs in numerous
sections of 1000 Nudes (Koetzle, Scheid); Julia Kristeva on the _clean and
proper body_; Klaus Theweleit's Male Fantasies; material on Neue Slowenis-
che Kunst (Laibach, etc.) in Amok Journal (Swezey); Deleuze and Guattari's
BWO; Charles Peirce's sheet of assertion; the pure skin preparatory to
tattoo; the classic manifolds of catastrophe theory; lampshades from the
concentration camps: the violence of in/scribing; the _trap_ of pubic
hair: Rebellion: the body that refuses to reflect!  Resistance: The body
that refuses to deflect as well!: The skin and hole that absorb; the tat-
too that seduces; the piercing that ensnares: That drag the body _into_
and _within_ the gaze; that _hold_ the body no longer suspect: "Our mis-
sion is to make evil lose its nerves." (NSK):  Without nerves, the body
has no name: Nerves are blemishes (although seductive for the torturer);
and again "We never speak of life as such but of the commandment of life."
(NSK): _What commands, totalizes. What commands is totality._ But: What
resistance with the _technology, prosthetic and otherwise, of the body?_
of _exercise, the workout machinic?_

Which _expels_ the abject, blood, woman, other, jew, gypsy: _Capital 
punishment of the tattooed number, defenestration of the _name_ as well. 
They have killed the body: What do they do with the corpse? 

Tiffany: "Hovering above the glistening woman on the rowing-machine, I see
myself reflected in the supple curve of her limbs." 

Tiffany worries about the ease of the mirror-stage.

Tiffany worries the future.

Tiffany hugs the laconic woman with a warm and tender hug.

_The woman tenders Tiffany._
