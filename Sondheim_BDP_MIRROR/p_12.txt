note: invisible territories. but the (white) man wanders (here) in (this) 
desert, in a circle. he wanders in the snow in a circle. he is tethered 
to the snow the desert. he is let loose not thinking about writing but 
writing anyway. but it is the granary and shepherding where it all begins 
and this is just about the same time as that.
