as with all creatures, we're going to die, perhaps a bit early, perhaps 
in a
bit more debris, surrounded by debris, or choking on debris, but die , 
just as
ever and before, and this is the urgence, this dying, but only -
the last of messages for nikuko, for anyone, the last of what might have 
bee
lasting
ah goodbye, goodbye, meeting is neither sweet nor sorrow, but the meat of 
death
itself...
goodbye, garcia
