(for Murat)


Eda


I wander up and down in my father's caravan.
The camels are old   they are laden with wine and cloth
And the ground yes the ground is stony and hard to traverse
The camels move and I   I work back across the limits
from one end to the other covering double the distance perhaps
Perhaps covering half   or now a slow wave my father's caravan
and I walking   the route of the stony ground

""Ankara is a wife, Istanbul a mistress"" (Murat) that is to say
Ankara geveret Istanbul isha    no that is incorrect, it means
nothing in no language    I walk back against the dark order
of forgotten language   the camels   gamal   they are walking
the cliffs

Between them there is a woman

Among them a woman  More and more is forgotten   the brass
knives    something for food   jewels pale before her   It is an
illness this mind   going quickly   I will beg of the doctor   I
will say  hasten my death faster than this   this forgetting
I will cease walking   after all it is only one   an end
to the other
