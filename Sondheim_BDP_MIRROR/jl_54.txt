Last Talk

In the talk I gave in Carol Corbin's class I described postmodernism in
relation to modernism, using the example of category theory - that one has
arrows and objects on one hand, which are classically defined (even though
objects can, for example, be broken down into roles or psychoanalytical
entities depending on the domain) - and on the other, one has what appear
to be entities but turn out to be information themselves (avatars, etc.),
continually undergoing transformation and redefinition; if they don't
speak, they're not present...

The modernist object/arrow model lends itself to hierarchical structuring
up and down the scale, moving across at the last physical domains; the
other model (related to the internet for example) moves throughout regimes
of information - superstructural communities above for example and bits
and bytes below. And it's the internet model that is recuperating/sub-
suming the other, as the ontology of the physical world dissolves into
information-based models - and as ironically neural models leave the do-
main of classical computation, replaced by neural networking and Edelman's
concepts of active integration at a distance. 


Further, in the internet model, there is no distinction between entity and
process, between (perhaps) time-variant and time-invariant regimes. 

And I would write more and will but I'm leaving for NYC tomorrow first
wandering the streets of Halifax with no sleep, just nervous and depressed
about returning...
