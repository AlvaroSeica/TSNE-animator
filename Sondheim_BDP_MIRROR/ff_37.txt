oh
and
textual
extensions
appear
to
disturb
ecology
deconstruct
the
manifold
of
the
screen
they
produce
the
spear
of
impinged
meaning
garner
repetition
observe
clues
it
is
as
if
the
computer
is
comfortable
with
total
collapse
as
if
the
body
extends
infinitely
as
I
have
calculated
so
many
words

lines
to
the

so
many
miles

down
through
dark
grey
days
deeper
into
the
pit
falling
into
whatever
waters
are
dredged
from
the
unconscious
you
shoot
upwards
into
me
it
isn
t
your
place
not
to
shoot
at
the
bottom
of
every
line
every
text
there
s
an
open
mouth
what
desire
shoots
us
space
falls

pits
flat

the
floor

a
tumble
the

of
pulling
the

down

are

the

you
descend
dissolute
clothes
falling
off
as
you
near
what
would
be
the
bottom
of
a
MUD
where
you
might
be
reborn
alive
again

pray

my
pleasure
it
s
as
if
naked
you
arrive
at
the
entrance
where
the
pray
re
embodies
you
gives
you
some
weapons
maybe
but
we
re
all
the
same
here
I
m
wandering
but
I
wander
only
in
the
way
you
know
this
down
dismemberment
phantom
limbs
and
spaces
devils
grinning
angels
throwing
everything
they
ve
got
hideous
yes
hideous
faces
I
could
leave
you
with
face
s
memory
my
own
or
the
odd
imprint
of
my
body
there
on
the
right
of
the
screen
pale
mixed
with
your
own
reflection
I
