   Characterizing the technological by virtue of the frame can lead
     to a circulation of reasoning; thus one extracts parameters
     from a situation, and these are used as steering-mechanisms
                     for others of a similar ilk
     through repetition - which amounts to reproduction. So that
      one might find the following in relation to the _frame_ -
      and it is here that one can start investigating what sort
         of material artifact surrounds whatever we examine:
       1. Circumscription - thus there is always a surrounding
              _discourse_ within and without the frame,
    which is not to say that it is not well-defined and one-to-one
             - but only that the frame is an _embedding -
      2. Which is associated with _bracketing_ - the foreclosing
 of the domain, which one might consider in a sense a potential well -
     3. From which parameters are drawn forth - or searched for,
        we might begin for example by placing gas in a beaker,
   increasing or decreasing pressure, noting the change in volume -
     later, temperature might come into consideration - but here,
  what's important is the _wall_ (such as DNA statistics separating
              one species from another) - the _domain_ -
   4. Within which _mathesis_ is applied, or rather disovered to be
    an integral part of the whole - the mathematization associated
     with standards, types, tokens, typifications, the whole run
                            of the world -
     5. In such a manner to create a condition of both isolation
                         from the environment
    and potential reproduction everywhere across it - the greater
       the degree of isolation, the more exportable the frame -
                 "Here we are in another country!" -
        6. Within which, however, "country" is reduced, as is
    the _subject_ and _subjectivity_ itself - or rather one might
    think of the _formalization_ inherent in this form of focused
                             perception -
     7. Forming the core of a _discursive formation,_ perhaps not
      one among others, perhaps one in allegiance with mathesis
                           and the world -
     8. Expelling the anecdote, narrative, singularity, in favor
        of repetition, ideal elements in cohorts with the real
            placed within a beaker or chamber otherwise -
    9. Through instrumental reason, this inherent observation and
    testing of reality, who know? ultimately implying both formal
            logic and formal consensual means of assent -
                              It's these
       that form the core of the frame problem, beginning with
                            What is there?
                              How is it?
                 Why is it there instead of nothing?
  - the _it_ formed by a degree of impetus constructing an originary
    division which _must be dealt with,_ in one or another form -
         that is, there is a _cut_ or _inscription_ at work -
      so that technology both divides the subject, then sutures
                        and interpenetrates -
       on one hand, the microtome, and on the other, the cyborg
             which are both carriers of viral parameters:
    These penetrate the flesh, invade the political body, the body
                              politics -
        These are _constitutive_ of the subject by virtue of a
                       _technological parabola_
         which arches _through_ the machinic, back out again,
     these kids running havoc with the spaceship operations room!
                 and I'm hearing numbers in my head!
          but it's the speaking of these things that permits
                 even this _word_ in the first place,
        placed here in the midst of other places, in the midst
       of domains, mobilities, presences still quiet, hungering
                          hungering to enter
  within and without the frame, it's this that comes to the chamber
                  in the middle of the stormy night,
   crying hysterically - you can't hear anything from the bulkhead,
      you're stuck there, running the ship - it's pretty neat -
 technology hurtling organic chemistries across inconceivable worlds
                        - I've heard of them -
      you've heard of me speaking about them - Heidegger says -
       "Enframing means that way of revealing which holds sway
   in the essence of modern technology and which is itself nothing
                 technological." and Heidegger says -
      "The essence of modern technology has for a long time been
   concealing itself, even where power machinery has been invented,
       where electrical technology is in full swing, and where
                atomic technology is well under way."
     But the primordial was there from the first mapping, and all
     those parameters and symbols, gesturing across the savannah,
                    look here, there's game afoot!
 and one might look instead towards those superstructures that close
  off _precisely_ because that's their intention or basis - I refer
        again to the foreclosing, the potential well, the real
                      _transport_ of the frame,
                          as a missive, say,
 as this missive, say, from me to you, message identification number,
              packet after packeting finding their way -
                         a way I do not know,
        later - the reading and writing, perhaps the replay -
                        later, the repetition.
