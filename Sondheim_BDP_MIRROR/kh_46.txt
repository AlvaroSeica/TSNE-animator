Nomail


I can't read you. You can read me. If you are reading this, you're inside
me. You know where I am. You know what I am saying I'm thinking.
But I can't read you. On nomail, I'm stopped, turned off, disconnected and
no longer in existence.
It's safe not existing. There's no rain here and the waters - there are
waters - are cool.
Or just the temperature of the body, or like the onsen with the snow
coming in from above almost the height of stars. It's exactly like that,
this nomail, the height of the stars and I call you from there.
It's summer, late spring air but here it's fall, early winter air, just
like that, this air on nomail.
Oh I want to be safe from you, O you!
Its leaves of golden signs enclose the world.
The world is encircled by its leaves of golden signs.
My silver body, copper thinking.
My iron thought rusting through while I tell you on my breasts,
What I have given to the thinking of these bodies.
Oh, my shame!
O shame!
On nomail, I am in the dark forest.
On nomail, I turn my redding face.

"I can't read you. You can read me."
