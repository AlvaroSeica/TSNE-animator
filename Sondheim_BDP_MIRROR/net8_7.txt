THE CADRE-L LIST





"They would erect a critical language, every word in Skolem-normal

form. For there are an infinity of errors, and only one clear path

among them." (Karl Marx)



TIFFANY organized the CADRE-L, hetero-, trans- and cross- sexual 

yearnings to embrace the other, always the body of dreaming through

the body of TIFFANY; it was KENT and FRANK who formed the shock-

troops, HONEY and JOAN who rallied on the outskirts of the list-

throng pledged to subterfuge.



CADRE-L had members and holes; you shed your skin when you joined;

you developed new appendages, old misappropriations, handicaps such

as the loss of the middle-joint of the middle-finger of the middle-

hand; language served you, CADRE-L multiplied through the interiors:

CADRE-L geared up for the invasion.



I would swallow my member, blood dripping from the tip, writing the

larynx. My blood wrote through larynx into the body of TIFFANY. WHO

CADRE-L: Tiffany@mind.com, Kent@body.com, Frank@psych.com, Honey@

psych.gov. WELCOME TO CADRE-L. CADRE-L is a list devoted to the 

ALWAYS-OTHER, nothing returned to the Same: Become a member: SPLIT

CADRE-L. Cells multiply, return to the body of TIFFANY, the chora

of violent drives, pre-symbolic, allusions to the dark spaces of

undifferentiated chaos. CLARA joins, Clara@body.com, applies the 

theory, Henon-maps all. QUEER THEORY: You would have to annotate  

this; ranks swell; TIFFANY doubles genders: THIS OR ANY OTHER. TALK
