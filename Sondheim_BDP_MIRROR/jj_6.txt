Elegy, Impossible Mourning


I am not in Perth.
I have never been in Perth. 
No one awaits me in Perth.

She has never arrived in Perth.
She has never been awaited.
She has never been to Perth.
She is not in Perth.

He has never departed Perth.
He has never been awaited.
He has never been in Perth.
He is not in Perth.

You, who are in Perth, do not await me.
You, who have been to Perth, do not await her.
You, who have been in Perth, do not await him.
