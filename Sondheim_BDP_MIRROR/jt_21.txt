Syntactics/Semantics


As the Net develops, the Internet courses taught at the Computer Instruc-
tion Center at the New School also change. And one of the deeper changes
is a movement towards _semantics_ - towards content - and away from the
syntactic strategies previously necessary for basic applications. It's no
longer important to teach the intricacies of ftp mailbox configuration,
tcp/ip stack setup, etc. Instead, one can concentrate on content - search
strategies, managing knowledge, etc. Push technology, active filtering,
intelligent agents, are all steps in this direction - but these are rela-
tively self-evident in terms of usage. So the teaching itself evolves to
cover specific searches, issues (censorship, screening, bandwidth, flat
rate, etc.), favorite push and outboard applications, and research.

These changes parallel the movement from, say, archie and WAIS towards
HTML itself, originally formatted as _semantic markup._ Only now, within
the past year or so, are design elements deeply incorporated within HTML
3.2. In the class, I give the basic structure of HTML - simply to demon-
strate the flow, impediments, and organization of text around any object
or browser.

In the future, the courses will simplify still further on the technical
side, and, hopefully, search strategies, useful sites and applications,
and the overall _image_ of networking will become the main focus.

In any case, I'm sending along the course outline below, as symptomatic.
