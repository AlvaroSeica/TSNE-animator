Island (Vancouver to Cape Breton) Life


Looking across the water to _an other shore_ (italics emphasizing the
metaphoric aspects of the world's subjective), the landscape is displayed
for well over a mile, under or over, perhaps twenty or a hundred miles.
Hidden features are emerge into consciousness, and there's a cerain trem-
bling in relation to the unruly exhibitionism of the hidden. Sky above and
water's gleam frame the spit or fjord's farther shore, landscape tongue
and teeth cradled by immobile lips. It's up to us to sing the words,
_.map_ or _look map_ at the ready for whatever gifts we bring to the edge
of consciousness, indeed. 

The most difficult truth concerns the continuation of desire, far beyond
viewpoint and framework of daylight time - that illumination is only the
partial consideration of the real, that recognition in its fullness would
overwhelm and suffocate us. Hence _nothing could be farther than the
truth_ - the distance is necessary.
