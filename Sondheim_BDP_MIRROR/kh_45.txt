Nikuko's Warning


"No more vague wanderings. You are not likely to read your memoranda, your
histories of Greece and Rome, or the extracts from books which you put
aside for your old age. Hasten then to the end, discard vain hopes, and if
you care for yourself at all, rescue yourself while you still may."

(Aurelius, op.cit.)

No more parables, perhaps. You are not likely to read them, to use them,
to gain the advantage thereby; nor shall your philosophies of France and
Germany, England and America, Japan and four-fold Japan, render thereby
the hope one might have for old age. Kill thyself, forget the world which
has already forgotten you, and whether or not you care for one and all,
plunge into the abyss, at least within your ken, not waiting for the de-
nouement of old age, the violence of disease, or the disease of violence. 

Do as I do.
