We invite you to THE NOWHERE DANCE

A performance at Alan Sondheim's Second Life exhibition "The Accidental
Artist"

Alan Sondheim: "We'll teleport people into an installation which has been 
constructed over a period of eight months. It represents nothing of 
architecture, fantasy, or surrealism; it's a space unlike anything in the 
real world. It's difficult to move through, a field of alien processes 
which has a life of its own. Sandy Baldwin and I will dance through and 
around it - on the ground, in the air, and on the ocean floor. Part of the 
dance will be based on learning to move around; part will be based on 
adding to the clutter."
