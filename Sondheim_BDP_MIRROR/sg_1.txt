recorded during last night's great storm; the first instrument 
is a double-tongued dan moi or Vietnamese/Hmong jaw harp, and 
the second is the octave harmonica from East Germany. the 
recording was done at the height of the storm and reminds me of 
Alpine cabins in a mythical past, fire and water entangled, 
music underlying all.

hocchiku after the clearing
earlier last night i couldn't play shakuhachi
in the upper register. the lord was bad to me. 
i was bad and full of regrets. i could not make
the instrument do my will and i had no will and 
i knew i should have no will. so i waited and 
then the hocchiku came to me. but even then it
was a slow centering.




At UMN:


[What I'm talking about, with video and image, later today,
12/2/13, at UMN, Judaism as it relates to my work. Beginning
with quotes from Hillel in Avot of Rabbi Natan, end perhaps
with live examples. If there were more time, I'd be applying
back-to-front transformations, as well as the elimination of
duplicate words - mimicking and enlarging upon the entanglement
of speech and creation. There is only so much time. Thanks to
Maria Damon, Sandy Baldwin, Foofwa d'Imobilite, Maud Liardon,
Azure Carter, examples and performances from everywhere. You
may have seen much of this text; I keep refining, recreating
the original from the debris of origination, such as it is.]

Semi(o)te Xt 2: Reading Jewishness Between the Text

Date: 12/02/2013
Time: 3:00 PM - 6:00 PM
Location: 125 Nolte Center for Continuing Education
Cost: Free
Description:

"Semi(o)te Xt 2: Reading Jewishness Between the Text" is a 
one-day symposium/workshop on Jewishness and poetics broadly 
construed; we will explore how poets and writers think about, 
produce, and enact Jewishness in their texts. The two main 
presenters will be Maria Damon and Alan Sondheim; Elizabeth 
Workman (MFA candidate in the Department of English) will read a 
response to last year's event, and Eric Lorberer of Rain Taxi 
Review of Books will respond to Alan and Maria's presentations 
as well as read some of his own work.  The goal is to engage in 
critical discussions about the permutations and fluidities of 
Jewish texts and how they situate themselves (or not) in this 
loose matrix.  The presenters will address, sometimes obliquely, 
the ways in which Jewishness is textually present in their work. 
One focus of the symposium will be to explore how this textual 
presence enables a shifting and changing of Jewishnessdifferent 
ways of enacting Jewishness in a range of media, but especially 
language.

IF I AM NOT FOR MYSELF, WHO THEN? IF NOT NOW, WHEN?

As a Jew, I am an unbeliever.

A Jew _must_ be an unbeliever: the Jew testifies to the silence
  of God.

All my work stems out of the discrepency of care - how can one
care in the (literal) face of death?

So I begin as an aetheist, but a haunted one, haunted by ghosts
and my own habitus as a (non-existent, therefore Godlike) ghost
of the future - which resonates, haunts me _now_ - my short life
- like all of ours - (ours, but not of our own possessing) coming to
an end.
