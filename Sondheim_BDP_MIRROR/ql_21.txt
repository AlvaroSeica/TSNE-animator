9. philosophical emergence. On one hand the utterly trivial production of 
music, and on the other, emergence after the face, recuperation of 
critical thought. But critical thought emerges through trivial production; 
it is the interaction of flesh, consciousness, the autonomic, and 
structure, that creates a different discursive space. Every philosophy 
demands a writing which is simultaneously elsewhere than real time, 
inhabited and uninhabited. The room for thought is not the lived thought 
of musical production. Or is it? Is there a philosophy within the real- 
time of its production, a philosophy that perhaps dies or dies out after 
the production itself?
