Phenomenology of commencing - gloss on Chuang Tzu vi\8


Nan (south) 
 bo (lord, chief) 
 Tzu 
 [ ] -k'uei said (asked) .  . alone
where did you
read as spontaneous
?
 [ ] 
 hear 
 this 
 ? 

said 
heard
all (various) 
duplicate, copy 
 black ink (inkstone) 
read as:
filiations of inscription, what is taken down, formulated, given form,
produced and disseminated: the articulation of learning, in the sense
of armature from origin or commencement (see sending). of hand-craft
as well the material which is passed on. duplicate: to assert.
 from child 
 , duplicate 
 black
ink 
 from 
 son 
 heard 
 obvious 
 chant, recitation 
read as: the chant or recitation is the first form, aurality not yet 
codified. we're moving temporally in reverse; inscription is after
the fact.
 from 

grandchild
 , obvious 
 chant 
 grandchild (son) 
 heard 
 it from 

read as: the filiation son/grandson ends at this point; lineage begins
at this point, tendrils above. so that kinship is a matter/manner of
chanting and recitation, a manner of inking and inscription.
appearance (sight) 
 bright 
 , appearance 
read as vision or impression (bright appearance)
read as sight or view
read as: the first enunciation of form, an appearance both particulate 
and blinding. 
 bright 
 heard 
 it from 

whispered 
 approval 
read as hearing and listening
read as: the murmuring of the world, the mumbling or ululation within 
the chora or receptacle - the seething or fractal liquidity of the
real. whispered approval tends to inundate bright appearance, the 
gathering of materia dejecta into the beginnings of identity, form,
structure, culture, language.
 , whispered 
 approval 
 heard 
 it from 
 needing
 service 
read as distinguish, express
read as confirm the practice of reality
read as approach the real, practice
 , needing 
 service (military) 
read as aid or help
read as: primordial intentionality, teleology, tropism, waiting.
 heard 
 it from 
 here 

extolling 
 , here 
 extolling 
read as chanting or singing together, in
read as: primordial sound, plasma, a1-supernova, universal chaos
tending towards coherency. we are approaching the bottom from 
the top, tending towards incoherency, the mystery or existential
problematic.
 heard 
 it from 
 mysterious (occult) 

darkness 
read as gloomy, dim, sullen, murky, obscure
read as: darkness of darkness of no light no image, darkness of 
darkness of no form of no form. of no formlessness of no 
formlessness. darkness out of which nothing emerges, nothing 
withdraws. the same which is close to but not identical to the 
emissions from the bottom, the originary flux, the non-identical
flux, the flux of no-identity of no-identity. but also of gloom,
of universal dark energy expansion, of defuge, of exhaustion,
of catatonia, tending towards psychosis above.
 , mysterious 
 darkness 
 heard 
 it from 
 empty

read as emptiness, vacant, unoccupied
read as entering, taking part in
read as: taking part in emptiness, joining the unoccupied. darkness
above is already an occupation, here of absence, absenting here, 
the writing or inscription, taking part in, not occupying, not 
there, almost as if the symbol were in someone's mind. as if there
were someone.
 goings 
 ,
empty 
read as: we have to start somewhere. 
 goings 
 heard 
 it from 
 doubtful
read uncertain
 commencing (beginning) 
read as beginning, origin, source
read as: we have to begin somewhere.
read as: read up through this sequence towards the symbol. for 
the symbol emerges as culture emerges, defines and constructs
space. propositional logic is based on shaky foundation of flux
and obscurity; in the dark, identity and equivalence are identical
and equivalent. as one escapes, the origin disappears, becomes
problematic, is deferred. as one escapes, the origin is annihilated.
culture is entropic in its very foundation, noisy in its axiomatics,
asservations. what is gained is always on the back of chaos; what is
spoken, must be whispered; it is the murmur that is whispered. 
nothing and everything is built within the murmur, speaking it 
louder, crushing its voice. the throat of the world is its silencing.
