everything i do is grotesque, misshapen
the sooner i get to space and time the better
the music screeches in my mind and i remember
doug saying he can't draw any more because the
pencil screams when he presses it on the paper

the music has its own teeth and melody
the music is a thief and harbinger of evil
it's stingy it won't allow me near it
what i think about is how violat it is
and how it screams when i try to play it

everything in my life won't let me near it
everything turns violent and plays my skin
my skin is an instrument of space and time
my skin is grotesque and misshapen

what i do is try to wear the music
the sooner i get to space and time the better

http://www.alansondheim.org/tungg.mp4

the TUNGG of the thing where SPEECH is PROSCRIBED

now i am safe here when i can rise
and place my tiny worlds out of site and mind
my tiny worlds are safe from everyone
and it doesn't matter if i can scream
i have a tungg and i can scream
my tiny worlds are safe from you 
my tiny worlds are safe from me
i sing
my tiny worlds where are you now
my tiny worlds where are you now
you're safe from me and safe from them
you're safe from me and safe from them
my tiny worlds you are my tungg
my tiny worlds you are my tungg
my tiny worlds my tungg and you
my tiny worlds my tungg and you

somewhere from Holderlin

http://www.alansondheim.org/geol18.jpg

somewhere from Holderlin's The Leisure

But rising into the moonlight up the broken columns
And the temple gates that once met the terrible, the secret
Spirit of balance, the chest of the Earth and the people
Be angry and ferments, the Unbezwungne, the old Erobrer,
The cities, like lambs, tears, once the Olympus
Stormed which stimulates in the mountains, and flames out throws,
The uprooted forests and breaks forth by the ocean
And the ships smashes and yet in the eternal order
Never mislead you power on the board of your laws
No syllable blurred, which is also your son, O Nature,
With the spirit of peace born out of a womb. -

machine translation, the original German found handwritten
in a fourth edition of Hermann Weyl's RAUM ZEIT MATERIE, 
1921

how nice, why so much music? why so much music? i work on surge 
theory with very little response; now, three of us are working 
together on a cd, Threnody, Shorter Discourses of the Buddha - 
everything on it has to be a combination of centrifugal and 
centripetal forces, flight and border or potential well, 
emptiness, the rush from life and death towards space and time, 
survival in a cold-death universe of annihilations. again there 
will be very little response; great reviews don't translate into 
sales or distribution or breaking even, or anything that might 
allow me, us, to go on, and i sense an ending just around the 
corner, children and grownups flee from me, as far back as i 
remember, animals yowl, plants wilt, mewl and slumber, forms 
slowly wander their uneasy path of disappearance

soon the music will be done and gone, disks to give away, no one 
listens, no one returns our calling

they cauterized my directories
they closed my MOO behind a firewall
they cut off my arms my hand
they cut off my legs my tongue
they cut out my eyes my ears
they hung me near your eyes your ears
they killed my haven
they plucked my lily from my navel
they refused my nightmares
they ripped out my umbilical cord

production preparation, Palmyra

http://www.alansondheim.org/survive5.png
http://www.alansondheim.org/eguitclar.mp3
 -> -> electric guitar + Bb clarinet

preparation of production
production of preparation

1. I don't have names for the pieces at this point.
2. Pieces are 4' or under.
3. Pieces are the Shorter Discourses of the Buddha.
4. Production of production and preparation of preparation.
5. Instrument names are not names.
6. I don't have the order down at all.
7. My nails are strong and my fingers supple.
8. "Yet my nails are strong and my fingers supple."
9. The qin, at any moment, out of tune.
10. Viola bowing leaves a lot to be desired.
11. Alpine zither and electric guitar = rough on fingers.
12. Risky gamble of maverick clarinet.
13. Balance Azure singing with embedding and clarity.
14. Cords, chords, and braid = sonic sheaves.
15. Sound remaining, for a moment, after I die.
16. The unclarity of the sound remaining.
17. Today I practice jinashi shakuhachi, alto clarinet, 
clarinet, electric guitar, viola, anything to keep myself
moving. These are the best for the fingers and lungs. 
Tomorrow the sazs, pipa, oud, Alpine zither, qin, others
that building on the simpler architectures of the western
lands. I read myself into a state of forgetting. How to
name the pieces, order them, keep them to the assigned
limits as if they were born to the length of a shorter
older singing. How to ignore the screams outside the 
window here, now, as if what mattered only were internal
resonances, murmurings of the worlds, skies elsewhere, 
and my thinking all through this, summed up in one word,
Palmyra.

Got.


The Buddha is perfection.

http://www.alansondheim.org/thren17.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/violamute1.mp3

One must be careful not to get in the way of a truck.
It's harder to get around these days.
The news got around that the Buddha is imperfect.
I get wary of bad news that's even worse.

The Buddha is pure in body and mind and speaks truth-only.

When he says he doesn't get it, he must not be listening.
Either get out the weapons or get out.
Get below in the bad storm of the intellect.

The Buddha's words conform to essence and meaning.

It got cold out when I thought about these things.
I don't know what's gotten into her every evening.
He got down from the train when it was still moving.
I got down with her and everyone knew it.

The Buddha's body, space, time, power, and life are infinite.

You've got to be kidding she said listening to him carry on.
He got into the sutra box and was playing with god knows what.
Give me a minute, he said, I just got in.
She got through the interrogation with flying 'colors.'

The Buddha is infinitely patient and teaches single-sound.

He kept trying to get up in the morning but it was useless.
His get-up was tawdry like a mendicant monk.
I'm really getting into The Buddhist School of the Small Vehicle.
She got to thinking about mendicant monks.

The Buddha never sleeps, never wakes, never speaks.

He got caught in an unseemly affair.
She never got through the night without suffering.
She got to thinking what a seemly affair might be.

The Buddha is emptiness and non-existent.

I got to dance one last time dressed like an Arhat.
I got into the class and thought about whirligigs.
I got out a brush and paper and began to think.
I got beside myself with grief.
I got into a shrine without lock or key.
I got some last night.
I got up on a ladder and threw it away.
I got down when I heard the Buddha was dead.
I got over it soon enough and looked forward to a new her.
I got into trouble worrying about ladders and propositions.
I got under the weather but it was still weather below.

What kind of GOD
commands his people
not to murder yet cowers
behind free will?

_Reason_

The reason why life should exist
is as arbitrary as the reason why it shouldn't,
life shouldn't exist,

the cls+ effect

http://www.alansondheim.org/lightsync.png
http://www.alansondheim.org/lightsync.mp4

chaotic light synchronization, westminster st., providence, ri, 
asynchronous stochastic (?) triggering of light-pole switching 
coupled with entangled ambient light, humidity, and sonic 
vibrations.

watch carefully and place photocell readout devices over the 
screen-shot lamp glares, being careful to account for the hand- 
held tremor effect and auto-focus mishap towards the interval 
end.

this clsastolscwealhasv effect has been bothering me, ever since 
we moved to the gritty little city built on reclaimed swampland 
and religious fevers.

of which at the moment i have one, a fever sweeping throat and 
lungs before it, taking no for an answer to every question i 
might still be able to hear.

the glare of the shuddering lights are my rock and salvation and 
comfort me, yay-though i lie down in one or another valley, 
preferably out of the way of traffic, or not.

the glare confounds the effect, by the way, but no camera lies 
in the first instant, and hardly speaks in the second.
