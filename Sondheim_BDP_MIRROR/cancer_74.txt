red dust


red dust fills all the crevices
you can't sweep it out ^ can't sweep it in
gathering in bundles ^ rippling across floors
through windows sashes cracks in earthworks bricks
red dust fills ears and eyes
sounds of marrow bone compressed papers inked
symbols dried in red dust ^ hands washed of it
across backs in the sun red dust seepings
streams of red dust gathering in bowls of water
red dust skimming surfaces ^ you can't clean it
can't be through with it ^ one way or another
red dust fills your mouth speaking red dust words
names and places sometimes making grammar
you can't forget its name ^ it hasn't any
you can't speak it ^ your mouth's full of red dust
