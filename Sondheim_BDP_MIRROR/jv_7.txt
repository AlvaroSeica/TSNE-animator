Jennifer spoke first. It's not that the grounds have slipped away, she
said, it's that there weren't any in the first place. Something it seemed
that would never have turned into an occurrence. She said and she said,
musing. 

Mournful Travis replied, What came within and without was unprecedented.
None of us, none, knew how to deal with this. We took incredible risks,
psyches turned borderline, ready for shock and trauma therapy; we may or
may not have suffered the same. 

Julu: Sorrow, I, that boundaries remain undelineated, that codes churn
through me in ways too often disturbed. I mourn what might have been my
children, but kin no longer hold; who among us is mother, father, son or
daughter? 

Clara speaking, eyes wide open, tears streaming, It is as if I were gone
among you, but naught, there has been no return, diasphora, carrying one
another among us to the farther reaches, remaining part, but not hived
together no separate as if in unthinking. 

Travis murmuring, Being that we together

Julu whispering, Being that were apart

Jennifer, The plenitude

Clara, The plenitude and naught, the none

Jennifer thinking, Through and into the evening, the sky curtaining down,
water sloughed from shores of pond or quiet pools, darkening

Julu, That life which may, which must be lived, the girder or beam of iron
or light

Travis now, Dreamed beam, always forthcoming

Jennifer, Of each other's flesh, until sections, prepared, quiet languag-
ings, revealed nothing spoken inconceivably, and again, and all at once.
What unraveling, unthinking we, turns to thought's presuppositions, what
territories, dominions, but after-thinking without number?

Clara, Within embrace, these paths already crossed, inscribed, forgotten,
dissolved, lost and distanced, a-maze ment without goal, stumbled under
anxiety,

Travis, And no cravings, and no hunger or dispute

Julu Among me

Jennifer Among me

Travis, Clara Among me
