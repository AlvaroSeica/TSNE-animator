divide
on the carboniferous valley in iced-blue mountainside
how can i divide and divide
clit mosses, ice and slopes festoon, elide
i do will make address
in tears she parted in her dark red dress
divide by leaving, but i stay, close
upon the mountaintop, above the furrowed cwm, alone
there are me here
recuperating consequences, assimilations, heights and fear
i no you he she we they
turn dreams that crags brought down to slither into day
i did forget a mention, striations and this straddled hearth
waters pull down dress beyond the tidal pool, the dry land's dearth
i am sorry if i want you
where world is actual, green groceries through
me she he or we they i
against the strata welkin, sward, soma, mead, or sky
i divide and divide and divide you know that's
beneath me rats and panties, above me crags and bats
how jennifer came when jennifer came when
fluorescent homes, your dark red dress and then
now i will write to no one
you turned, slit furrows of your breasts in sun 
now
lit nipples shadowed, moss springs beneath me wow
i will write to no one
i page and multiply beneath your breasts in sun
