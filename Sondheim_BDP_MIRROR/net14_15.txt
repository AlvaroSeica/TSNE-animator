WHAT WE SHOULD DO





Our lists are useless, without consciousness of class, feeding into

the blind-dogs of imperialism, the plutocratic fat-cats of capital

without a single protest! We pretend that we are not in the service

of the masters, fawning like slaves, whimpering over our alienated

bodies, not realizing the force of mediation at work here and every-

where! It is time we take to the streets, take the streets, take back

the streets!



Comrades! Let us examine this from the point-of-view of dialectical

materialism, the guarantee of truth - for matter cannot lie against

matter; matter can only give up the truth itself! Remember: In every

battle, _someone must always be correct!_ And with the power of diamat

on our side, we can do little but succeed. Remember: Truth itself is a

form of bourgeois reification! But the dictatorship of the proletariat

depends on a _deepening_ of truth which can only come about through a

materialist-synthesis of language itself! That is what our mission is,

in cyberspace: To prepare the grounds for a materialist reading of the

TCP/IP protocol, beginning with the positive concretion of the electron

particle or wave through the wire, the massless photon and its tunnel-

ling through fiber optic cable! Wires and cables replace the _threads_

of talk, of email lists, of usenet groups themselves!



First: We must TAKE TO THE STREETS! We must develop ABSOLUTE PORTABILITY

of our internetworking capabilities, using undernets and punknets, using

PACKET RADIO repeater controls! We must apply CYBERGUERILLA TACTICS 

which will lend themselves to the downfall of the RULING CLASSES, and 

the rise of WORKERS everywhere, prepared by the CLASS-CONSCIOUSNESS of

transmissions and receptions!



Second: We must TAKE THE STREETS! We must OCCUPY them with CYBORGASMS

of LOVE and ANARCHY in the service of DIAMAT! We must ELIMINATE FALSE

RELIGIONS, KIBOISMS, NEUTOPIANISMS, TINYSEXISMS, MUDDY-MOOS, IRC-SOME 

CONVERSATIONS! In order to THINK CORRECTLY, the DEFINITION OF THE 

SYNTHESIS MUST BE PROCLAIMED! CYBERMIND WILL PROCLAIM IT! Remember:

this is no FICTION OF PHILOSOPHY: this is ABSOLUTE REALITY!



Third: We must TAKE BACK THE STREETS! It is not enough to OCCUPY them:

They must BELONG TO US, for our FUTURE USE! This will include the estab-

lishment of TEMPORARY AUTONOMOUS ZONES FOR SYNDICALIST PATRONAGE OF

PEASANT COMMUNES, to be established hierarchically, with ANTI-KULAK

ANTI-MUZAK absolute power within the SUPERSTRUCTURE ITSELF! Such zones

must be PERMANENT!



Males and females will march together in the Young Revolutionary Social-

ist Works Vanguard of the Future Red Brigades!



Our first order of business: The establishment of a post-colonial power-

pack source of energy in orbit near Miranda, moon of Uranus... for 

future use... In order to do this, comrades... disconnect... take your

hard-earned dollars away from the fat-cat capitalists who prove your Net

connect... but don't worry... we'll be back...
