00 Let X = tan(approaching 90 degrees)
10 # in a very pure land
20 # this is not a very pure land
30 Print X in pixels and GOTO 00
40 and when this is all over go back to 00
50 and when back at 00 make the raster finer
60 # making it finer makes X go greater
70 # X is so very great!
80 X is so very great it begins to escape the screen!
90 X escapes all screens!
100 quick quick cat X > /dev/null
110 /dev/null begins to bloat with Pixel-X!
120 # /dev/null is crafty
130 /dev/null empty as fast as /dev/null is full!
140 X can go on and on and is very tired but /dev/null is not!
150 # this happens when I am very tired
160 I am very tired, emptying X in all its forms
170 # this is the end of the world
180 it is not a very pure land
