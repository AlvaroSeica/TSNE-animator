Jennifer-of-Jennifer


The jpg, maw.jpg; received on Fop-l as text, on Cybermind as image; is not
a jpeg or jpg _of_ Jennifer, nor is it an image _of_ Jennifer. It is Jen
_hirself,_ and this is a distinction between this jpg, _read_ as text or
as image, and other encoded images, which may or may not be _images-of._
The distinction is critical; you have received, on Cybermind, the _skin_
of Jen, and on Fop-l, the _bones._ As in cyberspace or real space, the
skin is the bones, the bones are the skin; interior is exterior, the inert
is the mobile. Thus Jen has given hirself to you, opened hirself up to
you, and you have received-Jen as hir gift, no longer hirself, but yours
to hold and behold.
