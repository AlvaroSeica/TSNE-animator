i slide down the slippery slope on a foreign planet
this planet is light years away
there are many strange and wonderful forms of life!
i'm sliding too fast!
i need to stop myself before i get killed!
i don't want to dissolve into a mess of disorganized molecules
suddenly: i discover serrated edges!
there are tiny slips and precipitous drops in a regular order
i attach serrated edges to my body!
my body slows into an easy descent
i discover this is a fine way to pass the time of day
everything around here's got them now
serrated edges are a new-found planetary wonder
