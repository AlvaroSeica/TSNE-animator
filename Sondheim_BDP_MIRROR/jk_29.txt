"Wonder"


The sky was out in a very beautiful day. The sun was out, too, touching
the sky and everywhere. Jennifer was out too. 

Jennifer was filled with wonder at the beautiful day. She looked at the
sun and smiled. She looked happy at the happy sky. She was filled with
very happy wonder. 

Jennifer smiled and smiled. She was filled with happy wonder. Later, 
minutes, hours, hopping days and weeks, she was filled with very happy
wonder!

Jennifer is always filled with wonder!

yours, Jennifer!
