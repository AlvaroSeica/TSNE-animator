Magatama Giving Birth to Computer Screen Thinking Back the World


Magatama, curved jewel, one of the sacred gifts from the gods in Shinto
O magatama around my curling neck, carnelian
O secondary magatama, magnetite reflecting grey metal back towards the sun
Carrying the image flat and sequested back into the sun
To which I am partial having peered across the edge
Peeled back against the sun where I can see the screen
Reflecting what has often been called an appearance
Almost invisible against the grey and metal rays from the magatama sun

Sundered legs of bending magatama jewel so it can't walk
Magatama curving belly so it's good for giving birth maybe
Magatama sloping back so it carries a lot of good it will do
Magatama stub-tail pulling it back into the earth
Magatama clitoris so it fits between Nikuko-lips
Darling-Nikuko-lips surrounding magatama nipple-tip
Magatama elbow curve so Nikuko-darling fits curling mom
Insert and magatama sperm so it wanders like womb-hysteria
Harbor and magatama egg so it rushes against uneasy dreams
Magatama comma-shape parsing english in its hardened tracks
Magatama tongued and swelling, O ecstatic stones
Gasped in magatama ecstasy, crossing magatama-baby

O my neck! My throat! O curved Nikuko arms and legs!
O stone! O granite, tourmaline!

Very writing each and every stroke!
Now appearing, for the first time, the exclamation mark!
