thank you for listening, jennifer
thank you for listening, jennifer

when I talk to you, and I do,
I want to talk with you, 
for we have no friends.
I don't want to talk at you, and I do,
because I talk to you, and the whole
of the world listens.
the words die out: don't shout
"when I talk to you, and I do,
