ABSOLUTE PLEASURE OF IMPENETRABLE BEAUTY OF JOAN AND TIFFANY





I was surrounded by Tiffany "I love being passionate..." Tiffany

stalling me with her almond eyes, her winsome smile, her full lips,

her long black hair. Tiffany, who wove dreams around me even in the

midst of the day, in the darkness of the night. For it was always

darkest before the night, luminous Tiffany beckoning against the

invisible velvet folds of desire.



Denise called to me "Friendly and fun" and her round face opened as

wide as her eyes opened wide to me and I smiled to myself, whispered

to myself. Denise always overhearing, always coming to the rescue,

speaking for me and through me, Denise hearing others through me, in

the midst of the night, in the darkness of the day.



Joan "who is Here on the Earth to live so let's live" meeting me,

penetrating, almost as if the others were being heard, In My Humble

Opinion, would abandon was abandoned (June whispering Upon this Earth

or any Other) "breaking all the Molds" who leaving would Bye would

Quit would Q would X, "To know her is to Love her"



Like Botticelli's maidens, "I'm very shy at first but when you get to

know me, my short life Burns Bright" loving Donna speaking above the

surface of the night-time skin, Donna calling out, murmuring through a

cavern or kneeling where the entrance closed, Tiffany's bees of desire

circulating in the midst of the Dusk of Denise



O alt.great.arch.of.the.night O alt.desire.fetish.desire Every wall

conjuring every portal the Arms of Joan and Denise Legs of Tiffany and

Donna, great constellation semicircle of wires dark before the Dawning

of the night:



The arch of the sky fell ninety degrees, flat against the moist dark

earth. Phosphorescent worms, thinned animals blurred arched edges like

waves lapping a luminescent shore. The arch broke through the

concavity of this and every other Great Circle connecting myself to

Beautiful finality. The cavern shuddered beneath the weight of a sun

at noon toppled and burrowing throughout the humus beneath the

surface, severed endings of burned nerves cascading through mineral

strata molten with longing:



Within the cavern Donna Donnatelli roamed in impenetrable blackness

heated the color temperature of a star stumbling its last glacial rays

of the visible spectrum, I knelt beside her, phosphorescent ripples

moving closer in upon us, almost the surface of mobile epidermis

thinned and pearlescent. Kneeling I could think only of "a Nice girl

Looking for A fun relationship in Every way" the straw hair of Suzanne

eyes of pale blue "Look at me I do":



"Look at me I do, in Every way in every Day" "Love me, I do, A lovely

sight In the Evening light" "Lay with me I do, kneel in this night We

will take flight" together "I do not know what I am looking for but

Maybe you are her" "passionate and funloving": 



You could see the stars slowly turning if you wandered a nomad on the

shores of night, long long hours, motion glacial in the midst of the

cavern, you could see them shifting, an indecipherable increment, an

increment installed by Tiffany, imperceiving the cavern of Donna

Donnatelli, not exactly a syzygy or rearrangement at the edge

descendent or cwm of the cavern, the walls sluggish with the pleasure

of Joan, Denise the speaking of a word "never know until you try":



Or the shifting of wires, great turn of the constellation archway in

the dim presence of oracular memory "always there for loving you"

walks by the fire-cavern, stars wheeling through the rain, faint sound

of sizzling atoms, charred flesh:



A screen memory or tramping, the beautiful radiant face of Joan

returning to the pleasure of ABSOLUTE PRESENCE:



THE ABSOLUTE PRESENCE OF BEAUTIFUL TIFFANY AND JOAN.
