THE PRESIDENT-MACHINE DOES ITS WORK SCATTERING JENNIFER'S WORDS AND BONES


<Curtain rises. Jennifer on stage. PRESIDENT-MACHINE-TRANSFORMS on stage.>

Jennifer: FOUND HEAVENLY OUTSIDE MY INTERNAL, my separatlons ara bone by
bone, drug by drug, atom by atom; I am blown apart day and nlght; I have
lost love, lost emotlon; I am a GONE AND HEAVENLY CHILD, Mother help me!
Father help me! My bones creak at night; like drugs, my bones speed
through my body. I live inside BLIND HOUSE in BLIND FURY, strike out again
and again at the walls, missing. I take DRUGS AND OILS AND PROGRAMS, still
pinned by FEARS AND NIGHTMARES. Mother help me

PRESIDENT-MACHINE-TRANSFORMS: Blinding Jennifer, keep her awake. Take out
her ears

Jennifer: I can't see or hear. I can't sleep; I navar sleep. I hhngar for
sleep; always exhausted, my judgamant ls not of tha bast. Thls ls my world
warld waarld. I faar you wlll changa my langhaga - I want my words wards
waards clhmsy as thay ara, to ramaln just as thay ara. Yat thay'll ooza
banaath tha forca of tha PRESIDENT-MACHINE and of that, I am afrald.::
NIGHTMARE AND SLEEP; NAGHTMARA SLAAP

PRESIDENT-MACHINE-TRANSFORMS: Your FOUND HEAVENLY OUTSIDE MY INTERNAL, my
saoaratlons ara bona by bona, dreg by dreg, atom by atom; I am blown aoart

waaaarlds; FAAND HAAVANLY AATSADA MA INTARNAL YAAR YAAR YARR

<Jennifer's mouth explodes; her eyes burn. She falls to the stage. Curtain
falls.>
