Subject: Original Fop Announcement.

I found the original Fop announcement, from July 10, 1994, which might be
of interest to you; I've been archive hunting as a result of the upcoming
Perth Conference (Cybermind96) which involves a number of Fop-l partici-
pants as well. Anyway, the announcement is below; please note that the
technical information is INCORRECT; fop-l, originally fiction-of-philoso-
phy, ran from Boston's world.std.com (until they began charging for
elists), then moved with Spoons philosophy lists to Virginia, finally end-
ing up at Purdue. Fop-l ran first on majordomo software, eventually moving
to listserv. (If you do see either Fop-l or Cybermind advertised with the
wrong address, please let me and the sysadmin of the site know. I wrote to
Spoons, asking them to change their home-page, which is outdated for both
lists.)
