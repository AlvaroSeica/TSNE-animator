Look what I Found, by Jennifer!


"I suspected all sorts of mysteries and deceptions around me. There was no
absurdity in which I did not believe. At the dawn of life, when such idio-
cies are conceivable, perhaps because of the memories of the baby smocks
in which I was arrayed still earlier, I imagined that at some time before
I was born I had been a little girl and that I had to bring back that fas-
cinating and delightful actuality by tightening my belt till I felt like
fainting. And sometimes I imagined that I was not the son of my parents,
but an adopted foundling." (Pasternak, I Remember.) 

That sums me up exactly!

Jennifer!
