my events want to be noticed, want to be heard
my events want to be seen, they want to make a difference

please make a sound and an image for my events
please remember, they are just around the corner
they are just below the floor, just above the ceiling
they are just behind your back, just below a whisper
they are just beyond of your touch, just before your speech
please remember my events, always there for you
