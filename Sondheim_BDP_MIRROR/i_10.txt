Dreaming





Every item placed as if it were always remembered for its use and the

name to which it belongs.



Propitiation carried the namesake of the day and each and every night.



Losses became elsewhere the nourishment of being and each way reflected

every other.



Resonances became swollen with resonances, occupying culture's frayed 

edges, naming the territories.



Between the stars there were more stars, and between them, incommensur-

able void.



This was the place of names, no visible source of light, the fulfillment

of: Olber's paradox, a direction which murmured the world. 



If Olber had been right there would have been a world of comfort; if 

Hoyle had been right, so much fulfillment!



Articulation from equivalent distances, and distances.



None.
