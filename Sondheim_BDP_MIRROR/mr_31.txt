Privately for your attention,

My father is late now and I just have to confide in you. The soldiers have
killed him and expelled us from the barracks. This is an urgent SOS and
you are the only person I can rely on at this horrible times.Father
managed to courier the family treasure box containing the investment money
out to Europe for safe keeping befor his death. Claude and Nora are very
sick and are staying with a distant family friend who does not know any
thing about the family money. I need your help quite urgently as we are
planning to emigrate from here to a safe country and put that family money
to gainfull use. For security reasons, please respond to me immediately by
email stating the only telephone and fax numbers that are directly to you
so that I can commiunicate more to you about the situation and what needs
to be done.

Your's respectfully,

Tudor Puletic
