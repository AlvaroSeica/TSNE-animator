for the sake of _the continuity girl_  (by _the continuity girl_)





the _need_ of _the continuity girl_



who doesn't know what she needs or what freud wants

but who knows she's needed to keep the world afloat

from explosions and cruise missiles and the wrong ties

on a man dressed up for dinner and the wrong dress

on a woman tied up, online, she's addicted, he's waiting,

they're poorly dressed for the occasions, cocaine



but the _need_ of _the continuity girl_



so that the building or flesh doesn't suddenly change shape

across the charred body of the _dramatic-script boy,_

so that the world doesn't cave as disease explodes

as the man cruises for the woman, as the man's tied

to the woman who constantly changes her name

while he fires her gun at her name, while she changes

into her name, her name into hers



for the _need_ of _the continuity girl_



goes across all culture, civilization, society,

goes across all movie-magic, special effects,

goes across all normal effects, tie on the woman,

dress on the man, as they're on a cruise

and _dramatic-script boy_ rises from the dead

skin-grafted from _the continuity girl_ and

the building missile totters, wait a minute
