  
     		         where and how they lived
  
  Heidegger's Black Forest hut or home, where the wall felt its way down
  			      into the earth
  Brecht's apartment where the ceiling exposed itself as someone's floor
       Mayakovsky's yurt in high wind, designs shivering like flags
   Bachelard's stone walls leading to more stones and still more stones
  Derrida's thin tent where you can see the thin bows strung across skins
		   and more skins and still more skins
		        earth and skins and bones
		        flags and floors and skins
		        bones and earth and floors
		        skins and flags and earth
       Bachelard swept Heidegger's hut and you should see the shine
  	    Mayakovsky waxed Brecht's floor to a subtle sheen
	    Derrida and Mayakovsky traded secrets of the wind
			    flags of the wind
			    sheen of the skins
		     there's more of the bone's shine
			    more of the bones
