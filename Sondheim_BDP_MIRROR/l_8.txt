Return to the Wall and the Stain


_Paint_ / _Stains_

As Amethist posed and I answered, If I say you tell me the road is to the 
right, would I be right?

I return to the wall and the paint, the paint on the wall or hooped from 
it, iron worked into the roadway.

The case is always already the sign of the other, inscription, _that_ in 
the classic sense, but with tagged null-sets, An~A=0subA for example.
A's the case. Stain: inscription meandering towards the fissure, gesture 
(see my Textbook of Thinking). Inscription: the other; fissure: the same. 

Stain is the revolt of substance, and the wall: the revolt of the human.

In the lpmud: Case: vnum obj [X] or vnum mob [Y]. The mob's in the street,
object on the wall.

One takes wall-refuge in substance, stain refuge in space - nomadic: How
we long to get away. 

How we long to stain ourselves. How we long to dynamite the wall. How we 
long to shut our eyes.
