Folg mich! Nikuko is my shtik! Emmis! I wanna shtup her all the time, she

says I'm a piece of drek, the gonif. Shush, she'll here you, I don't care,

I'm a chosid. Whatta life! It's a meshugeneh velt! I tell you, maybe

she'll want me! Efsher! Ei! Ei! Right now, it's kaddish for the lot of

them! She wants Jennifer, can you imagine them stupping? Jennifer's such a

klotz! I tell you. Lookit her, screaming Shveig! across the room. Nikuko's

tsitskehs are beautiful, Vai iz mir! Jennifer's yelling, S'art mich vi di

vant! Mameh's had it right from the beginning. I'm thinking Nikuko's

pirgeh, her loch, right in my face! Jennifer, stop with your Zeit gezunt!

If you're leaving, leave! Don't be so narish, okay? Zol zein azoy! It's my

shtik, my piece, and I'm sticking to it! Nikuko calls me an alter kucker:
