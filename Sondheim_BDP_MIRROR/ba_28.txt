Encryption1-5-7


The female Spanish voice is identical, as is the "Attention," and the code
which follows it, but soon after there is something new: the repetition of
the five-digit name of the recipient, and, after a pause: the numbers 1-5-
7. This precedes the message itself, in typical five-digit rows or columns
(one imagines a matrix here, the whole an emblem of the maternal, from the
soft insistent voice, to the background spectral mother, murmuring a truth
until time sloughs time, until truth is _gotten,_ until the proper event.)
1-5-7
One imagines 1-5-7 as the _title_ of the message, as in: KILL, LOVE, GO,
STOP, SELL, BUY. All this on 6.8260 mHz on the shortwave, _exactly,_ sig-
nal strength at maximum.
1-5-7
(I), having listened for years, the slightest change of format is thrill-
ing; the world shifts, splinters at the edges, another deal _done._
