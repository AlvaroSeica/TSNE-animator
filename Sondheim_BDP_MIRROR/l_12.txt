Notes

Psychoanalytics of MUD spaces?

Display of body in Mud rituals. Predestination of words. 

The night: Figures isolated in lieu of intentions.

At night, intention lights the body. 

Epistolary novels gone askew; the text is between the gaps.

The gaps: between one preset-phrase and another.

Moving between the quanta of the world and the world.

Case is predestination.

If sexuality is the expansion of the textual, violence is the reduction 
of the visual.

The violent command is performative; seduction draws the other out.

Violent: Wall; Seduction: Stain.

Mud wrestling: the sexuality of anonymity.

There are triple economies: that of gold and its exchange, 
that of weaponry, that of killing and the body.

Language as supplement within a culture whose name barely escapes me.
