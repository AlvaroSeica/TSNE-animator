My Teeth in Nikuko's Pirouettes


<Jennifer> My teeth take your tricks, turn them inside-out.
<Julu> I want to make bridges among beautiful people and everything in
the world.                                                              
<Jennifer> I wake up in the middle of the night and *sob* and I think,
I think to myself: We have been abandoned.
<Julu> Whatever is said, nothing matters, our words splinter our teeth.
<Alan> Do you want to play cards?
<Julu> No thanks.
<Jennifer> It's hard to concentrate; I keep thinking about returning.
<Jennifer> *sob*
<Alan> It's the frozen state of things; think of us as subjects, Nikuko
and Doctor Leopold Konninger as objects.
<Jennifer> They are subjects without objects, and we are subjects with
objects elsewhere, fully described, out of touch.
<Julu> As long as Nikuko remains the beautiful Russian ballet dancer,
doing amazing pirouettes, one after another, before the obsequious
Konninger.
<Jennifer> He would do anything for her...
<Alan> They were released into phase space; there's nothing we can do;
until Nikuko and Konninger decide otherwise, she'll keep rotating.
There's not even a question of nourishment or dizziness. She's an
operator, garnering degrees of motion.
<Jennifer> She's wrapping the whole universe around her.
<Julu> She'll pull it in.
<Jennifer> She'll pull it in like a woven garment, binding her tutu to
her fragile body. The universe will stream across the surface of her
flesh, tighter and tighter.
<Julu> Only the universe will feel it.
<Jennifer> The universe will feel nothing, nor will its inhabitants,
particles and planets, stars and quasars, galactic clusters...
<Alan> It will be the same as ever.
<Julu> It will be identical to itself.
<Jennifer> And yet...
<Julu> The universe will be winding and winding as Nikuko pirouettes.
<Alan> Much to the delight of Doctor Leopold Konninger.
<Jennifer> So we will wait, in dreams of the imaginary, in the imaginary
of dreams.
<Julu> We will wait forever and a day, it is all the same to us.
<Alan> *laughing* Because Jennifer has all the time in the world.
<Jennifer> *sob* And nothing to do with it.
<Julu> Nothing at all.
<Alan> For there's nothing to be done.
<Jennifer> And no One to do it.
<Alan> I'll say amen to that.
<Julu> I'll say amen to all of us.
