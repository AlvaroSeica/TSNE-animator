A park here has ducks. They don't migrate. Do ducks always migrate? They
didn't in Irving California. Geese have stopped migrating. It's not true
they're brain damaged. They behave normally. They have a lot of energy
because they don't fly all that much. They have a good time. They like to
stay around! The water is supposed to be poisonous with sewage backing up
from the harbour. It's not true there's no life and it's just poison. We
saw a big eel in it!  And we saw algae and no duckweed but lots of under-
growth. We saw a fish too. The ducks went back and forth. They had some
little ones. They were alpha beta just like everywhere ducks. 

The ducks had no tumors and the eel was fine and healthy. Their feathers 
and its scales (I couldn't tell whether a he or she!) were healthy. They 
could see just fine. They flocked for my little bread (not the eel!). 

I always believe everyone. I'm so naive! There is garbage in the pond in
the park and it is really bad. There is trash in and out of bags. The
grounds are nice. The cemetery in the distance has toppled gravestones.
There are teen-drink places (we're not out of the woods yet!) and stuff
thrown about. But the ducks are fine! The eel was really great too!

I think the ducks don't want you to know this. I think it's a secret. No-
body bothers them because they're stupid! But they're not stupid, they
know what's going on. They eat yummy fish and plants. It's really neat. 
Everyone leaves them alone!

Tuesday I am going to the tar ponds. They're supposed to have 700,000 
tons of PCBs in them! Everything is supposed to be dead! We'll see!
