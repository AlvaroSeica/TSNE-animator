susan graham, there's something going on, well she said,
     look over there, you can see the police cars at a distance,
	  well she said, they've got their lights on, it must mean
	       something, there were flurries in the air, just a light
	       coating
      really, you c
      uldn't see much in the black night but the lights
      looked like
  	 towns, you'd hear the occasional siren and a
  	 woman's cry,
  	      it was heartbreaking, we didn't know what it
  	      could be, it
       was a mile or so away, the lights were
       swinging above the
    	street, flashing as
    	  well, as if they knew, an
    	    electrical charge in the air,
    	    sheet lightning or snow
    	    thunder,
       there was a feeling of
       danger, i noticed a dark
       shadow crossing
            the street, you
            didn't know what was
            going on, it looked
      	   all like stars,
      	   with the
      	   swaying
      	   traffic
      	   light above
        it all l
        ike a sun
        or moon
        sometimes
        a shadow
        would pass
             or
             the
             sirens
             would
             start up
             and
             die
             out,
             the
             whole
             town
             moaning
             and

             weeping,
             for
             whatever
             was
             going
             on
             down
             there

             we
             went
             back
             inside,
             had
             another
             drink,
             the

             slide
             guitar
             mourning,
             for 
             the dead,
             for you,
             you
             could
             still
             smell
             the
             heat
             of
             the
             day
             in
             the

             hot
             red
             texas
             earth
