when do you say, i am done with experiment, now i will talk with you,
now you will hear me talking, with no transformation,
and then you might hear me, you might hear me saying,
i'm tired of making meaning, i'm tired of meaning and making meaning,
tired of all of this, of carrying the necessity of language,
the needs of the speaking of language ; there are no angels,
there never have been, there are no others, but of the proffering,
i am sure as long as it's unthought, the way the sun follows form,
think of a sundial ; there are no others gracious in reception,
what i have done, you might find me saying, i'm tired of phorias,
of meaning carried before the back, reachless, gracious, silent,
as long as there are words
