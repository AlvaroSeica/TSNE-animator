Carried on the wind. Sprockets. This post. Frames. Out against the. 
Control track. The wires of which my fingers. Blood under the nails. I 
throw them out. The post. Which carries my skin slit. Words pour from the 
wounds. Which claw at the wires. 

You see how it is, words, wires, wounds, wind. The wires wrap themselves 
around me; it's that which stiffens my cock, holds it in place. This is 
the secret of males; this _holds it._ When we speak. When we are silent 
or when it collapses.

The words heat the wires. The helix was born. The cunt churns through the 
central core: core of MUD, kernel of Unix: wireless, the wind packages 
itself. 

"O hurry wind!" the little fishermen say as the wind froths their tiny 
oceans, whipping their rods taut with the energy of the deep. "O I am 
such wind!" say the little fisherwomen, casting their nets into the 
thinnest ridge of all, that between the anus and base of the testicles.

The ridge is where the words joined the words. All three sexes have it. 
The ridge slopes down where the wound wires wounded, the base of the 
musculature of the legs. 

There where the mud seethed from the hole. Where the bloody fingers held 
the glove of the post. Where the post searched itself for you. Where you 
held a memory. Where I was.
