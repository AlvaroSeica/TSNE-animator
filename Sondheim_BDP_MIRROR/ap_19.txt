dawn*


cancers flooding the body in part or in full, tumors attacking one or ano-
ther organ, membrane-spreads of _illnesses of the surface,_ attacks on
bodies non-virtual of all ages, genders,**

there are millenarian warnings as the human tide heats up, microbes ap-
proach with landing-gear erect, this is serious as insecure bodies escape
to the cybersphere, sloughed skin dragging them back,

we are close to degeneracy genes gone bad in polluted air not responding
to antibiotics lost, no longer fortification bunker against molecular
transformations, lost, in other worlds, the air itself,

wires clean wires with electrons, cloyed filaments, carbon dark against
smoothed electron emissions, tunneling, run around the sync clock, skin a
sin or shame a dark shadow, no longer named but ceased symbolic,

so we slough skins, our poisons trail behind us, so our membranes turn
translucent, troubled, and there were no tomorrow

*dawn's brilliance cuts the eyes' retinal spoils, dwelling and source of
disease, scoured in the heat of day

**so many I known have been cut down in the dawn of life, suppurations
suddenly appearing in the half-year past, portending uneasy crawl
towards overpopulations, extinctions***

***for real, the theory appears simplistic, pollution, extinctions, ozone,
desire, capital, technology, spills, desertification, violence for real
for sure****
