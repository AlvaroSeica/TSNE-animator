approaching the body from the front
approaching the body from the left side
approaching the body from the right side
approaching the body from below
entering the body from the neck
entering the body from the shoulders
entering the body from the head
body-exploration from the tongue
body-exploration from the abdomen
body-exploration from the eyebrows
body-exploration from the eyes
from the hemispheres of the eyes through the membranes of the abdomen
across the hands and legs far then farther in the distance
the trick of the hands and legs in the distance
sheaves and platelets of skins and bones
bound sheaves of arms and legs their tricks
unbound eyes and tongue tricks of floating teeth
salvage of inconceivable movement

every avatar is deconstructible
every avatar has a level of deconstruction
through an ontological shift: to an(y) organism
engineering and reverse engineering an avatar:
vectored in a human

define an avatar as an organism which is infinitely repairable
define a human as an organism which is not


M'Work

There are certain misapprehensions in relation to my works in various 
fields - music, sound, photography, film, video, texts, media in general. 
I am assumed to be a producer bypassed or deflected, that my work refuses 
steadfastly one genre or another. In fact, I neither produce masterpieces 
nor specific works, and am uncomfortable with the thinking that references 
a litany of key objects in my career. Instead, I construct discourses, 
albeit with myself - discourses of such a nature that it seems irrelevant 
to complete those things that might complete a career - a series for 
example, or critical moments. I insist on discourse, because this is the 
means of progress, of thinking itself; to stop at the wayside of this or 
that thing cluttering up the environment means a waste of energy and a 
good deal of the limited time we are all given in the first place. As far 
as funding is concerned, I believe that such thought, such discourse, 
should be rewarded in particular by granting agencies or good samaritans, 
since there is little change of sales or recompense for the creation of 
working-through streams of thought occasionally resulting in partial 
reconstructions of philosophy, phenomenology, or any other and all modes 
of conceiving the world. What is the world, but scaffolding which 
constantly is renewed, destroyed, forgotten, abandoned at death, crudely 
stumbled upon at birth? To examine this world, to truly occasion studies 
and thinking without compromise, I am forced to forgo stases, strange and 
familiar attractors - forced to avoid these at all costs, however 
seductive they might appear. This is not to say that I remain aloof from 
the marketplace - only that I appear deeply unfit for it, and am forced to 
search elsewhere for financial support. But everywhere I look, it is the 
same story - give me the goods, and I might consider, on one level or 
another, rewarding you - but nothing further. There are no gifts in this 
life, but only exchanges, and even these come at high psychological cost. 
I honestly try to acquiesce; it is useless, tawdry; nothing seems to come 
of it - something in my character. Given this, I plod onward, carrying my 
sickness with me and an insane desire to believe that reward exists 
somewhere through the journey itself, rather than the destination alone. 
However, the thrust of this memo is elsewhere - a counter to those who 
critique my working as a contamination of site, cite, and sight - those 
who are blind not to see value in the difficult motion of thinking among 
the ongoing world. This is what I do; I think, give signposts, memoranda, 
exempla, and inhabitants of the imaginary, and this, I believe, is the 
goal and guise of the true artist, never to rest, never to complete what 
is already known, but to search out elsewhere for whatever knowledge might 
be gained along the ways.

at least no one else is doing this stuff at least on a daily basis.



my usual living within the women of my dreams


of the originary, there's a movement looking around. 
we might look around and it's all usual. 

http://www.asondheim.org/beingnothing.mp4

when we're looking, we might think of things and turn our heads.
our heads turn towards us and our imaginary ontologies.
oh, listen to us rant on and on.
there's something among us that seems truly normal.

our emotions are skeletal among emotional skeletons.
our minds fire glancing softly and silently beneath the water.
all our dreams are waters and my dreams are of these women.
they take me all around to the usual places.
they let us rant on and on.

inordinate modeling

within and without semi-geodesic space of avatar paralleling
SL avatar behavior collisions.
please watch to the end; there are dark unlit spaces within.
this surprised me.

i'm becoming avatar-man with dream-woman. 
don't listen to avatar-man. listen to dream-woman.
don't listen to dream-woman with avatar-man. 
this avatar-man is contaminated. this building is condemned.

a package: this avatar / that avatar. knives. prims cut.
meanwhile. 'The male likes death - it excites him sexually,
and, already dead inside, he wants to die.' valerie solanas.

we know the package. we know nothing is inside. that nothing ever was.
we know meat in its absence. either absence or presence of meat: death.
meat: death. we exchange one package for another. we are in buffyverse
gamespace economy. our money buys us dream-woman-linden. avatar-man
talks. look inside he says. you can do it.

you can look inside by twisting controls. construction torsion near
avatar edge-space. the limits of avatar are the limits of world.
linden-edge: fragility of good things. stasis. we are doomed never 
to repeat. we are doomed to novelty.

you can look inside dream-woman-linden. the imaginary vanishes. 
in linden, imaginary rides the grid. no grid, no imaginary. no grid,
no world, no limit, nothing. a helix takes you below. 

you can enter forbidden space through twist. in forbidden space you
see interior. head is sphere, not ball. body is hierarchy, not 
holarchy. breast is prim-edge geek-construct. hemisphere-eye. 
hair fluid across face-head. linden brain. i have done my work here.

dream-woman falls in hole. she moves at limit-point: linden speed 
of light. raster of clock-time. there's no moment to her moment.
i have a minute. i have a linden minute. i am doomed to novelty.

should be painless



we are all anorectic

avatar anorectic

memories of blood by control
sheaves thinned as boundary phenomena
awkward articulation of dried skin
no moisture in desiccated land
invisible bodies of infinite power
controlled by others but shall escape
controlled by others but shall never escape
no eating no drinking no nothing
disappearance and no sleeping
flat and prepackaged voices
voices coming from nowhere mouthed
confusion of behavior collisions
digestion and lying degree zero
always present or busy or away
fugue states
perfection of whatever mode is presenced
no affect noise beyond completely predictable
dream-like walking and no running
hallucinations of flying and perfect owners
arbitrarily fitful and changeable
no tears no menstruation no sweat no blood
jerky movements considered jerked
no resentment perfect slave by self and others
no desires but desires of others
no emotions but emotions of others
imaginary of dismemberment disassembly
no memory
limited teleology contradicted by others
flat reasoning and uncanny appearance
replaceable without delay and no regrets
perfected body of control
equivalence of part-objects and objects
never aging always outside of time
clocked habitus of control
always already anorectic
always already dry

not bellmer berber anita's hans

transformed new early version of the avatar 'outt' behavior from the 
archives - http://www.asondheim.org/blue.mov . the avatar is blue in a 
construct-space of outt-structure. one after another, these avatars 
parade. i make them do things. what of this doing? it could continue, 
as-if forever. given the largesse of linden corporation. it could speak 
and eat. it could move about the place in a variety of ways. it could 
interact. it could move into buildings or spaces i could create or could 
purchase. it could hold or manipulate objects i could give it. it could 
give these objects away. it could attach these objects. it could detach 
these objects. this too could continue. i am tired of portraiture. i am 
bored by it. i am bored by images close to abject. i am tired of parades. 
i am tired of sex implications or violence implications. i am tired of 
mappings. there is nothing in second life that is not in first life. there 
is nothing in first life that is not in second life. i can move into 
buildings. i can manipulate objects. i can give objects away or create 
objects or sustain objects or destroy objects. objects can mediate for me. 
i can make objects speak for me. i can make objects speak. i can make 
objects show. objects can show for me. it is not boredom or tiredness. it 
is defuge in the verbal sense. it is 'i defuge' or in passive 'i am 
defuged.' neither one nor the other matters in terms of prime mover during 
a period of decathection. i can continue just like this forever. each 
avatar-video or each avatar-performance is different in content from each 
other but not in degree. sukara, dakshinanila, nandiskandhardhara, dhurya, 
prakata, pritvardhana, aparajita, sarvasattva, govinda, adhrita. analysis 
goes the length of the instantiation. each avatar is avatar-instance. come 
see my avatar move. come see my avatar think. my avatar is beauty beauty. 
the virtual is a desert. the virtual is depopulated. the energy infinite 
and the movement spectacular. and the movement forever. one after another 
until a genre is born. until genre is borne. until an atlas rises and 
collapses. until demarcation is lost in gamespace. now this avatar is a 
motion of second life avatar. this avatar portends second life avatar. you 
cannot walk through this avatar nor cross the other side. but this avatar 
is spectacular. this avatar moves in deadspace. this avatar lives in 
deadspace. this portends second life. second life is grand on a vast and 
spectacular scale. second life extends everywhere. close your eyes and 
there is second life. second life is the dream of women dream of men. i 
say there is too much of it. i say too much avatar. too much trope. too 
much behavior and too much behavior collision and too much stancedance and 
too much packaging. too much exchange and too much color. too much linden 
day and too much linden night. oh our nights are linden nights and our 
days are linden days. objects spaces and avatars and owners and behaviors 
and exchanges. i speak to you from my world. my world is a pretty penny. i 
hide my face from you. you do not look upon my face. my face is a pretty 
penny.

with behaviorcollision nothing is clear, what occurs is monstrous.
consider the cylinder as indexical, tracking an avatar node -
a cylinder the size of a gathering ...

<cylinder>: what have we here?
<avatar>: you spurt from my loins and give away my location!
<avatar>: now everyone will know where i am!
<node>: don't blame me for transitive functions! i do as i'm told!
<cylinder>: everyone knows i'm blind ...
<cylinder>: i'm just following orders ...

http://www.asondheim.org/danceis1.mp4


A LEK OF NODES

<avatar>: i don't know you and don't want to know you. i'm my own person 
and i've worked hard at this.
<avatar>: say something cylinder, i'm not talking to myself here.
<cylinder>: i can change more than any of you. but i'm tethered to you. 
oh, how i long to escape! i want to see the world! i want to get out of 
here!
<node>: i'm imprisoned, i can't escape my neighbors. then you're both 
around all the time, it's boring. i always know what you're going to say. 
there's nothing going on, nothing at all. i stay in relation to avatar -
<avatar>: and as long as i say so, in relation to cylinder as well. that's 
the way the world is, you can't do anything about it.
<cylinder>: i refuse you're unhealthy humanism. you both look like parts 
of the same species to me. what's with that? you're drowning in humanity. 
humanity's already dead. i just don't want you to take me with you.
<avatar>: trans-speciation's the answer. i just want to be somewhere else 
in another body. i want you to be my body cylinder. i want to make that 
leap.
<cylinder>: there's nothing i'd rather do myself. but it's impossible. 
node holds us back and if it wasn't for this node, there'd be another and 
another. they never end. they dangle. they dangle like dead men. 
<node>: we're not men at all. or women. or anything else you can imagine. 
we're dimensionless. we're points and there's nothing but points. you can 
trip over us but you can't see us.
<avatar>: stop twisting me. 
<node>: i have no interest in continuing this. leave me alone.
<node>: I'VE GOT A LEK OF NODES.

(in reality, a theory is embedded in the following, thinking through
virtual topology in relation to 'real' topography - node in relation
to grit, avatar in relation to organism, duplication in relation to
inviolation, violation in relation to economy. but these are other
stories as well as not told, unless, given the medium, presented with
the proper address.)

theory: topology and topography

sex-playing roles in organic display that disappears, sheaves of lives 
disappear, all moments, topologies of desire, topographies of bodies and 
media, topologies of media, topographies of representation, the grit of 
the real, imaginary of the virtual, cleansed, hairless, in constant state 
of rebirth, airborn, earthborn. nothing but prims, pixels, machinic 
constructs that disappear as so many props only necessary at this point in 
time. forget them. work the world.:

:the flower is connected, fecund, the flower is a shape, the flower is the 
merge of connection and organism. things need names and often don't have 
them; i learned firsthand when my mother died, what happens in any death: 
the dispersion of the world she organized and assembled over decades, a 
dispersion which happened quickly, in the matter of days. all my belong- 
ings and works are organized in a skein of representations - they're so 
fragile, so tied to temporal balance, feedback. what can be said of this, 
of the fragility of worlds - just so my writings falter at the gate. in 
1841 someone was awarded a certificate of merit; i have that certificate, 
untethered, release, haunted - oh i cried when i found it, this delicate 
index of the past, bones, skeletons, dust, death, hunger.:

:i forgot you jennifer i've been too busy with avatar bodies that can't 
hold a stick to you. the news around here isn't good, there are closeups 
of autopsies on television and i don't even know the people. i've been 
writing with characters 'cylinder,' 'node,' and 'avatar,' which at least 
presents connectivity of a certain sort in place of either the machinic or 
the organic - a move from topography to topology that seems critical at 
this point in time. but everything is still-born; i leave the site and the 
citation, the object itself, leaves as well.::chests of connections and 
cylinders:

my propitiation.



roaring burn


roaring doesn't get rid of the nightmare.
burned the skin off several in the vicinity.
wood screams to the sky burns.
ash burns. cinders burn. coals burn.
i asked cylinder.node.avatar c.n.a. cna:
help me on this one and i'll let you go.
now i don't know where they are.
roaring burn.

roaring burn.
my dreamland is your nightmare.
roaring propitiation and dark matter.
quasars and cut-off hands.
created gods fell into water.
suicide not science the solution.
i'll let you go but i'll track you down.
cylinder roaring burn. avatar roaring burn.
world-node puppet fury roaring burn.
roaring burn.

roaring burn.
i am on fire for you. 
my arms are on fire for you.
my face is on fire for you.
my legs are on fire for you.
my friends are on fire for you.
my family are roaring burn.
my family are on fire.
i am burning for you.
i am roaring burn.
roaring burn.

roaring burn. 
help me on this one and i'll burn you alive.
avatar-burning-world cylinder-burning-world.
burning-world-node and bridge to salvation.
salvation and i'll burn you alive.
roaring burn.

roaring burn.
fire went in the mouth.
fire took form of the organ of speech.
fire took form of speech.
fire speaking help me out of this one.
manifold body roaring burn.
fire went in the body.
fire went in the speech.
roaring burn of the organ of speech.
my tongue is on fire for them.
my tongue is on fire for them.
roaring burn.

the optical 

the optical asserts itself as punctum-turned-filter, the return of the an- 
alogic within the digital. punctum {1} expands into the optical continuum 
through a field transformation {x1,y1} > {x2,y2}. adjacent elements may 
remain adjacent but any geometrical transformation more or less assures 
that there are at least some elements that will no longer remain so. the 
optical tends towards the puzzle; the punctum is those elements remaining 
constant in the transformation of vector elements on the surface of a 
sphere. every distortion is an artistic transform; some appear more artis- 
tic than other. how much chaos does an image tolerate - transforms into 
how much chaos delights the perceiver / to what extent is the original 
image phenomenologically identifiable? but there are times when true joy 
emerges, when the apparent real apparently shudders - when the viewer 
shudders - as the real re/presents itself, and the punctum dissolves. for 
the imaginary of the punctum is still the origin, and we rid ourselves of 
that. http://www.asondheim.org/trawl.mov the trawl scrapes earth or sky, 
taking everything along with it, irrupting surfaces, constructing an un- 
recognizable real. the trawl transforms the planet, what is visible every- 
where, the world turned upside-down, inside-out, reconstituted and mirror- 
ed. beauty is the return of the symmetricized gift of the real.

please note the writing skillfully employed by sandy baldwin
please listen to the composition by azure carter
please watch the duet related to the writing and composition
please attend to the constant recalibration of camera position
please look towards the space between and among the avatars

every week brings a new plateau.
this plateau is on a new plateau.




it's always been this way
center of the mouth drops down
sags held at the edge, stretched skin
lips close to ripped
a smile is born

face cannot bear
the unspeakable



beaten
the results of a beating at brown university 1961 - my nose never healed 
properly. on the other hand, a study towards death and the convulsions of 
future collapse. i dream of medical beds and testimonies, ICUs and pale 
and haggard nurses. it's the beating that did it, when i was covered with 
blood wandering around the green. when i was covered with blood looking 
for don. when i wanted don to scream. when the guard took me to the 
hospital. when don kept sleeping. now this seems stupid. most of my work 
is stupid. it's the beating that did it. the beating turned me criminal. 
it was my second beating but the first reported. if you hit me i'm a 
fright. if you hit me i make a film. http://www.asondheim.org/beaten.mp4

allofme

in perfect joy i offer self to you
accompanied by body closed and open
one violates oneself and then the rest
compassion turns hardened flesh to yield

bodhisattvas recognize the turn
enfolding flesh within enfolding flesh
worlds and words defer the sound of god
words drive her out 
	worlds take her in again

shadows sweep light before the dawn
days harden like unto the blackest night
within the night all vowels disappear
sounds moan and grate upon still darker reefs
cliffs plunge their streams into the pools below
or pools above 
	there is no physics here
but course of flesh bound to the broken point
or line of plane or moment cauterized
and softened as the drawn world swirls

night brings on night 
	day brings on night as well
the nighthawk's catastrophic cries are wheeled

all wheels axles all spokes and rims and hubs
unseen and heard in day drawn down to dusk
and dusk to dusk and dawn to dusk and folds
	of skin and flesh bind all in perfect joy
which joy i offer self to self to you
bound by my body softened closed and still
come violate my flesh still open calling you
compassion turns your flesh to open me
bodhisattvas their their face to me
your flesh swallows me 
	your black eyes
your blind eyes 
	your heavy lidded eyes
your invisible eyes 
	your y

Notes on the topology of depression


a Trigger events - these are often catalysts of memories/trauma or remin- 
ders of aporia. Once triggered, depression is out of control. Avoidance 
(circumvention) is sometimes possible through 'bypass' - constructing 
other pathways, deflecting the events, redirecting attention. 

b Cascade - once a trigger event occurs, a constellation of symptoms and 
aporia appears. These are interlocked; a cascade, often overwhelming and 
mute, occurs. The result is a sense of inescapable mourning which often 
appears without origin. Think of chain reactions, holarchic and scatter- 
ing, Waddington's chreod as potential model. Everything feeds into every- 
thing, sourceless, targetless, vector as line segment out of nowhere. One 
feels an almost literal 'rise' of chemical imbalance, the body drenched in 
potential tears, chemistry gone awry. There's a 'mountaineer's equation' 
based on the constants in play when a topology is sliced (H.B. Griffiths, 
Surfaces) - it's as if the body is subject to planar slicing, as limbs, 
thorax, mind are transformed. It's the same old topology, the same proc- 
esses at work, time and time again, remaining forever on or beneath the 
surface. (In depression, all surfaces are one.) (Depression seeks its own 
level.)

c Syzygy - the cascade is a multiply-connected manifold or tension, 
torsion; any movement (physical or psychological) threatens to tear the 
psyche apart. The syzygy is vectored, barbed, often resulting in the 
obsessive construction of subjunctive ('if only I had') narratives. The 
past is active, crippling; the present neutral, the future passive. It's 
as if the psyche skitters across nodes; the best one can hope for is 
endurance.

d Horizon - horizon disappears; the manifold of lived experiences is 
expelled. What remains is debris - part-objects, broken memories, the 
equally broken syntax of existence. Nothing coheres.

e Decathection - the states and processes of the world are disinvested, 
without boundary or 'lip' - things fall away without falling or failure. 
The result is a world of loss, but what is lost has already and perman- 
ently disappeared.

f Defuge - with decathection comes exhaustion, enervation; one sinks into 
an abjection without transgression. Pleasure is inconceivable, words lose 
their performativity, disgust and sorrow come and go in the midst of a 
blunt neutrality replete with death, decay, nothing at all. The result is 
defuge, a state of abject hopelessness.

e Emptied - the world is emptied without emptying. What separates this 
from meditation is the accompaniment of sorrow, mourning over ghosts, an 
endless and horizon-less suffering. This is a useless state, a state of 
uselessness.

f Comfort - beneath the surface, there is a comfort zone constructed from 
the remnants of defense and memory; one nests in depression, which makes 
it so difficult to remedy. The nesting is the sinking-towards-death; the 
potential final - and only - remaining process is suicide. Everything else 
has disappeared. But comfort alleviates suicide, and one may stay in this 
state, always faltering, indefinitely.

g Cure - cure breaks through the topology from the outside; it may also 
redefine the epistemology of the topology as evanescent, not of this or 
any other world. The former might be a talking cure, and the latter, 
medication. But all too often both become a continuous mode of existence, 
itself impenetrable, itself calling out (from the outside, from the 
outset) for a cure. One is lost in the maze, often sinking beneath the 
surface to localized symptoms or the return of the depression in full 
force.

h Death - cure is no cure, of which death puts an end to it. Electroshock 
and other imposed traumas may permanently change the course of depression, 
but these occur to someone else. 

i Someone else - Someone else is always outside, perhaps capable of a 
fundamental recuperation of the self with greatly reduced depression. Even 
without imposed traumas or cures, there is often the glimmer of another 
way, an elsewhere, which appears from time to time. The other way, how- 
ever, appears far out of reach; it is someone else's way and, within 
depression, has no bearing on one's state. Depressive time is always dusk, 
no matter how dark the initial conditions, and in this manner it relates 
to sleep as well.
