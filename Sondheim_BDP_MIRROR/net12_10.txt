I see my name above as a triple-header, look down at the keys, gaze at 

them, gaze at them. I am afraid of my image; I refuse to look into 

mirrors, find myself ugly and unconscionable - a glance can ruin my 

morning, make my sleep uneasy and fitful. Hiding behind thick glasses, I 

peer out at the world; the world peers in. When the screen is dark, there 

I am, frog-like, thrown into a world of appearance; when the screen is 

strewn with language, I disappear behind its glare. If only I could work 

the same magic in real life! But there, my image, thick, nondescript and

slovenly, gives me away. I sink deep into myself, skin filling my mouth; 

I stumble in my speech. On the Net, I run things through at a distance, 

work in the imaginary, labor in the uncanny. I speak best when there is 

no me, when the self-hatred subsides and the language begins. And here, I 

work this magic on you as well, filling your screen my love, and you too 

disappear, momentarily, returning, I hope, on the other side, wiser and 

more content with yourself, knowing what a monster you have left behind, 

what a monster writes these words.
