lying in bed late at night, trying sleep once again, thinking of julu and
junnufur and all alun avatars, then beginning to breath, uuuuuhhh, then
going on breathing, uuuuuuuu, and OH! they did breathe themsulves in and
out of me, with my muuth loosely open, it did become so clear that u was
the vowel of the supine body, the body losing air, the body expiring, the
body in cries, in purity, this u of suffusions infusing effusions diffus-
ing cultures and cummunities, speakings and writings, this u of junnufur
perfuming ,,,,
