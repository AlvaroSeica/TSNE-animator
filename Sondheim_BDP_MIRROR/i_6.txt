The Most Difficult Path





Taking or writing away during the reading of air

When nothing is given. Play or air combine. A leaf

Gives belief. The song begins to lose itself.

The song says: I once had a mouth to live in,

And now I wander exhausted, you have forgotten this.



Because you did not hear it, because of the reading

of air.
