Damaged Life, 1989





Inside the mother-father

The baby turns.

Screaming and dying,

Its body burns.



Flames leap from its fingers,

Father-mother lies dead.

Flames leap from its eyelids,

Eyes burn in its head.



Mother-father cries, rising.

The babe turns around,

In anger strikes out.

Bones fall to the ground.



Father-mother falls, crying.

The babe once so rash,

Kills its tormentor.

The body's in ash.



Dust falling and rising,

And parents and child,

Still burn within daily.

Their cries are defiled.



Dust rising and falling,

None shall atone.

The baby still turning,

Dies daily, alone.
