Aggregate abcde unordered

Linked aggregate abcde, a -> a' --> a'b'c'd'e'

Example, an aggregate of rocks, a linked aggregate of explosives

Aggregates are capable of spray, collapse, chaos-mother, avatar-binding,
mirroring, etc.

In an aggregate, any ordering (axiom of choice) is equivalent to any
other

An aggregate spray possesses no history, since there are no ordered
trajectories 

An aggregate collapses possesses no history for the same reason

Thus an aggregate may be considered an accumulation of temporal states, 
whose sequencing has been lost; its temporality is itself an aggregate
