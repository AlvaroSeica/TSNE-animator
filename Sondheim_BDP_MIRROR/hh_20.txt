The image is a leaky signifier, she says. It's uncanny, existing within
the relatively Euclidean space of the screen. But even the phenomenology
of the screen, or the rectangles within it, can't compensate for the
eeriness of the closeup of the face. It's not the cunt or the cock; we're
used to that, display of organs, exchanges, reifications, typifications,
taxonomies, lures and masquerades. It's the look of the eyes staring hard
into the blank rectangle or circular maw of the camera - and the camera
not staring back; shouldn't it be clear, by this point in time, that _the
camera does nothing_ but establish the vanishing-point of the subject?
It's already there, running the virtual, just like I run Alan, she said,
_exactly_ like that. She said, there's no difference, because where
there's difference, there's the signifier. And she reiterated that nothing
could be further from the truth.

She remembered looking across the space into Alan's eyes and fading; her
last thoughts were of weak theory, Vattimo-somebody, and Italy-somewhere.
It were her last thought.
