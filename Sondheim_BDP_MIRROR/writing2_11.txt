While I could easily sit down and type out a text like this, I wouldn't 
have thought of it - not all the circulations and meanings that keep 
rising to the surface. It was the program that allowed me to do that. In 
this case, I don't even see the need for changing anything - sometimes I 
have to change things around, bring the meaning out of what otherwise 
might be considered nonsense.

There's still another area I work in, with my work - and that is in 
various kinds of chatrooms and other conversation-oriented Net applica- 
tions. At times I've logged onto a chat as two different characters, and 
created a play by having the characters talk back and forth with each 
other. (Of course I'm both of them.) By saving - logging - the whole chat 
session, I'm able to make a work I would never have thought of otherwise, 
again. The dialog seems to carry itself forward.

Of course this form can even be used in the sense of writing a play but
there's something different in entering another space and using it to
create dialog. The following is an example of this (as usual, see below
for commentary):
