my heart throbs for you
you sail the uncharted seas of distant lands and bleak horizons
you move through mountains and valleys and the darkest forests
my heart yearns for you, my eyes cry for you
your love follows you in your beauty and your long flowing tresses
your love follows your long golden hair and your eyes of deepest blue
my arms dream of you, my legs take me towards you
"for i will follow you until the ends of earth and time
"for i will walk behind thee until mountains fall and valleys rise
my heart, my heart, my eyes, my arms, my legs
your golden voice, the pause in the middle of a word, eyes wide open
eyes wide open and open wider, and eyes wider open, and open wider
my heart throbs for you
"for i dream of you and think of you, your voice whispering on the wind
"for your beauty is deeper than the ocean and your eyes bluer than the sky
my arms long to hold you in my arms, my legs yearn to hold you in my legs
your eyes wide open, your eyes open wider
my heart yearns for you, my crying open eyes
