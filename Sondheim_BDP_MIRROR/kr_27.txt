Neuraesthenic


Thrown against the upper cranial aspects (no one says), tendrils shoot
across the net like lightning - no one present on the talker, no one there
for ICQ, no one in the chats, no one hungered around for ytalk. Tendrils
withdraw, curl into basketry. Within the baskets, souls. It's then I
recognized Nikuko was neuraesthenic, withdrawn and wan, delicately and
violently harboring the life-form of a flower in her forgiving hands.
(Nikuko draws on Lafcadio Hearn.) A visage appears in the blood-red womb,
the red-brown womb, the sea-borne womb, darker brown, tending towards
black, no one knows the source of the dim light flowing towards the floor
(no one says). No one brings names into this place; "Nikuko draws on Laf-
cadio Hearn" is discarded. Replacement-semantics, mobile tags, flooded and
toppling structures, emanations. Emanation is the sure sign of the neur-
aesthenic; something uncanny glowed about her as flesh and features seemed
to form, coalesce, into a coherency described as human. Then disappear, no
one coming forward (no one says) for conversation near the hearth. Here,
the hearth is everywhere and in dark bloom. Here, shadows are emanations.
Here, neuraesthenics are emanations, ancestors of ectoplasm. Avatars are
centuries in the future.
