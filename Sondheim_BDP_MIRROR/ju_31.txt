+++ modem hangup: 
Here, mail scratched against the name of the domain.

This test case ends alas with the triple crossed +++ modem isolated
in a darkened world with stilled wires crossed and correlated out
O O alas

You may wonder at my thunder while my words are blown asunder and 
the wires start the fires on the lines like fields of mines and the
light is always gone and the virus mode is on and there's nothing
like the rhyme when +++'s out of time

Whut guus uut uf lunu, ulwuys duumud tu sputturud mudum, fuuluru tu

ulluvur und uvurywhuru spull, unguung umptuud uf ull uffuct

No one replies to phenomenology.

every moment when the word leans
it becomes another word and language
gains ascendence across body and 
function as if there were speaking
at the beginning of things which 
already announced their beginning
because she said there were extru-
sions from the start that wrapped
around itself adjusting her shawl
in the cold wind by the north sea
where ice flows burned the sea down
and brine turned its loamy foamy in
white emerald there in the true sea
where plankton rose and deep blue eyes
and blond hair swirled in black light
of blue by the grey sea by the black
sea by the brine sea by the sea brine
where the words flew as she spoke
into one another as the moment pulls
back and shows its white teeth through 
the sizzle of words in color words
pulling back language she commented
i didn't come here for this
