WIRES IDENTITY





The following occurred this evening; names have been changed to protect

the innocent.



First quote:



Alan: I just had an adventure. In the middle of writing you, I got a 

Talk from Clara, and went online with her. The line got cut off from my

end suddenly and I redialed to reconnect. Bypassing the login, I found 

myself suddenly in the middle of a raging argument about a screwdriver 

on an AYN RAND IRC. I was apparently in the middle of someone else's 

account, someone by the name of Tiffany Rogers. Meanwhile Clara had 

fingered NETCO and found out I didn't exist. I got her on-line again 

through Tiffany on Tiffany's account and we quickly completed the 

conversation. I thought about checking Tiffany's mail but that wouldn't 

have been cricket. So much for cybermind security.



Second quote in Talk:
