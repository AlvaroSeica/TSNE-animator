Big Data Synthetics (BDS)

Data synthetics (DS) is the science of examining raw data 
corrupted with an encounter with the real, the chora, the petite 
a, the a a priori, the imaginary, the abject, the unhealthy, the 
contagious, the sickness unto death, the monstrous, the grotesque, 
the anguished, the obscene, the unutterable, the mute, the 
silenced, the wounded, the corroded, the decayed, the silenced, 
the victims, with the purpose of drawing conclusions from whatever 
peripheral, outsider, insider, testimonies, may be obtained from 
whatever information is available, keeping the raw data raw, 
embedding the raw data in the organic, the turmoil and trauma of 
edgespaces and blankspaces. Data synthetics is used in many 
professions and protestations of the true-real to allow all pf us 
to better comprehend the world around us; it is also used in the 
sciences to problematize or disprove existing models or theories, 
or to embed such theories within lifeworlds and modes of dwelling, 
and to create dialogs between such theories and modes and the 
physical structures of our local multiverse.

Let's play the game. Let's think this through.

Coyote's running, he sees Locust, so he breaks his leg because 
Locus was carrying his leg. Later he falls dead for some reason, 
I forget what. Magpie comes along and plucks out his eyes. That's 
why the magpie has eyes. Then Manitou comes along, says what's 
going on here. Coyote comes back to life, catches Locust, takes 
his leg, places it on his leg, and his leg is healed. That's why 
Locust walks with a limp and a jump. Then Coyote kills Locust, and 
Manitou gets his legs.

Let's play the song. Let's sing this through.

"and your synthetic cathedral syntheticinged
and your synthetic folks your bunnyinged

and your synthetic cathedral syntheticinged
and your synthetic folks your bunnyinged"

Then this:

synthetic, not analytic restraints, not really necessary, but all 
is analytic or all is synthetic; holding her mapping, her map 
presenced. this system is not established by the synthetic 
activity of synthetic commodities and commodity simulacra; it 
serves no other purpose. they lie, they say, men are analytic, 
women are synthetic; Coyote says it's the other way around, 
henequen, and coir. A variety of synthetic fibers may also be 
used. The analytic-synthetic body. The synthetic-analytic body. 
techne questioned.

Then this: BDS: big data synthetics. Data corrupts data, 
BDS corrupts BDS. Then this:

then this:

Amjad Sabri, Famed Sufi Singer, Is Gunned Down in Pakistan New 
York Times - 17 hours ago Onlookers and journalists gathering 
around the car driven by the singer Amjad Sabri, who was killed 
after unidentified gunmen fired into his car, in Karachi, 
Pakistan, on Wednesday. Amjad Sabri: Pakistanis mourn singer 
killed by TalibanBBC News Amjad Sabri, Renowned Pakistani 
Qawwali Singer, Shot Dead In KarachiInternational Business Times

Sabri silencedDaily Times

you just can't do the music
you have to do the music

opinion: republicans in the senate should be tried for murder 
by proxy. they just have to have their guns. they just have to
use them.

Hypophora: But what should I do with my music? If I play my 
music it's meaningless. But it keeps me alert, alive, ongoing, 
thinking, theorizing, exercising. But it takes too much time, 
too much energy, far too much stress. But stress is good for me. 
But stress will kill me. But who wants to live in a dying world? 
But the world is still filled with wondering. But suffering is 
on the increase. But you can buy a gun. But a gun is horrifying, 
only useful for killing and maiming. But you can kill yourself. 
But then you just can't do the music and you have to do the 
music. But then Republicans in the Senate should be tried for 
murder by proxy. But then you have to try the Republicans in the 
House. On the other hand, you can listen to the music. You can 
play the music and listen to the music.

You can listen to the music.



Early Man

This is the Song of Early Man

http://www.alansondheim.org/bctrip1368.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/EarlyMan.mp4

Early Man is screwed up in the blood-red sea of Galilee
  and the blood-red sea of the Great Salt Lake
Early Man hunts his Early Man hunts his Early Woman
Lightning hunts Early Man
Lightning hunts Early Man and he says enough
He says enough and walks around his Cave
All Early Man are Cave
He has names for Cave
He says enough and in this blood-red sea he leaves
Early Man leaves us all behind
He leaves Early Woman behind too

I am so pleased at boldness
I am so pleased at taking the big step
I am so pleased at taking the big hunting step
In the future you will only study Early Man at school
  and you will only study Early Man
Please let us know what you think
Please let us know what you think if you are Early Man

the "gentle giraffe with tall children, eating the "leaves of 
trees." i am why was the giraffe a foot? because he was looking 
for food. southern Africa to chase the giraffe; but surely I 
hear them and I hear you. i am the mule, who can never breed. i 
am the gentle giraffe who gave name to the giraffe banjo or 
giraffe banjorette as the case may be, made by Stewart in the 
1880s but this one I suspect may be 1870s anonymous. i never 
knew of the instrument until visiting the Intermountain Guitar 
and Banjo online site and then visiting the store in Salt Lake 
City, where I met Leo Coulson, who I knew in Providence in the 
1960s, when he was half of Providence Guitar and Banjo. I was 
amazed at the store, ended up purchasing the giraffe b. which is 
ideal for me, fast action, fretless after the first octave. 
something to work with on our endless meandering, next stop Las 
Cruces, then back to Denver. In the meantime I can practice 
daily, which I desperately need to do, and I can enjoy the odd 
19th-century sound of the instrument. The sound is presented 
raw, (no echo, sweetening, etc.); perhaps errors abound;
giraffe1, you can see the centering occurring as the piece
proceeds, somewhat in-scale based; giraffe0, somewhat blues

poetics, note

http://www.alansondheim.org/bctrip1581.jpg

"More to my taste was 'Osymandias,' in which Shelley took death 
and futility head-on and still managed to emerge with human 
dignity intact. And here was Whitman, page after page of him, 
tremulous with desire in the lilac-scented night. They were just 
doing their job, these poets, which is really the job of all of 
us--to keep applying coat upon coat of human passion and 
grandiosity to thre world around us, trying to cover up whatever 
it is that lies underneath." (Barbara Ehrenreich, Living with A 
Wild God, A Nonbeliever's Searh for the Truth about Everything, 
pp. 48-9.)

Is there a job for poets, and would this be the job, or would it 
be in fact to uncover whatever's down there? And isn't what's 
down there what _is,_ that rhetoric, language, gesture, being 
itself, covers up? What can be done with something that resists 
_doing_? What is it, that what it is being called here, is 
uncalled-for? What are we writing, if not always already a 
_calling_?




The trip to date, summing-up! the partial summing-up. 
the tentative.

We have traveled around 7250 miles so far, and I'm beginning 
this in Las Cruces, New Mexico; tomorrow we return to Denver. 
My sleep's constantly disrupted, and I wake with a sense of 
hurtling somewhere undefined. 

I would then think it's time to begin a summing or summing-up - 
of what? A journey which is always unfolding, my work so far or 
the work already finished if not accomplished in both senses of 
the term.

I keep going over the three terms, gamespace, edgespace, 
blankspace, with the caveat that 'game' is a term for nothing 
more than a somewhat well-defined arena within and without which 
there are rules of some sort, which might be, I think now, in 
the shape of the McCarthy formalism, "if A then B, else C" 
entangled with the little I understand of category theory - 
let's have objects become morphisms, morphisms become objects, 
let's deal with dynamics across loosely-defined skeins, etc. 
etc. What might emerge is a fluid space and equally fluid 
descriptions of that space, which is among other things, a life 
space - and I do not think that "life" is a "game" except in the 
limited sense I'm using it. Think biomes, inputs and outputs for 
examples, or emissions intended as signals among backgrounds 
which may also be interpreted as signals or noise. And so forth. 
These concepts bounce.

And edgespace is then part of the bounce; on a simple and wrong 
level it might be thought of as a region where rules are 
diminished or broken or forgotten or annihilated or transformed 
or objects themselves. It might be said that if gamespace is 
based in a definable hierarchy, edgespace is where the leaks, 
the abject happens, where the hierarchy becomes immersive, and 
where symbols may, by intention or otherwise, be replaced by 
others, or where symbols may even default; one is immersed in 
edgespace's structure, without inhabiting it; one inhabited and 
and is immersed in gamespace's structure. Or hierarchy/holarchy 
of structures among them. In edgespace one might come across a 
process or sign and ask "what's this" and there is no answer and 
it's not an (equally logical as gamespace itself) issue of 
hacking or cracking, but something else - a 0, an alien 
punctum, an embodied datacrash, something "of some sort" which 
doesn't resolve. Which is untethered. Which is at a loss, 
unaccountable, uncountable, unaccounted-for. So bear with these 
dreams:

Then blankspace is jectivity (as I've noted before), projection/ 
introjection, processes and entanglements whose ontology as well 
as epistemology are problematic, whose habitus is immersive, 
whose definability would always procure a loss and anchoring in 
a fictive gamespace/edgespace regime. So there is the triad 
game/edge/blank and the dyad definable/immersive, and we're off 
and running, let's say, towards categorizations (Peirce's 
triads, Celine's three dots) that obscure the fundamental _thud_ 
that is Rosset's reality and I think our own, that basis/bases 
entangled among everything, whose resolutions are problematic, 
whose morphisms are simultaneously close to spectral 
efflorescences and disappearances. Without being either a 
physicist or a mathematician, how can one even think, for 
example, why the fundamental constants are what they are, and is 
it always to be assumed, for examples, that their values might 
be a form of jostling? (The definable/immersive dyad is summed 
up, perhaps, in Whitehead's comment (somewhere) that 2 + 2 = 4 
formally, but in fact there's a processing going on; I was 
always interested in the latter.)

In everything here, I'm overstepping my bounds; I run and hide 
among the forest of symbols and processes of game/edge/blank, of 
immersive/definable, which are sufficiently based on mind and 
organism as to operate successfully within the dominion of 
theory, as long as that theory doesn't rely on Sokal effects, as 
long as the entanglements, which always point to those effects, 
can operate within limited domains as well, however game/edge/ 
blank that might be.

So that is the thinking here, and then as the trip continues, we 
find ourselves searching out organisms that are new to us, plant 
and animal behaviors we haven't seen before, and even music we 
haven't heard, types of music we haven't heard, and even musics 
which are untyped, uncategorized, as if they were untoward or 
undone in the process, continuous or segmenting, of their 
making. So for example I'm playing giraffe banjo, and an 
Albanian cifteli, constantly wondering why I'm behaving in such 
a fashion, jumping from instrument to another in a form of what 
might have been called primitive accumulation; I'm not a 
collector of instruments but a collocationist of musical 
structures, unstructing, and deconstructions - just as I video 
and photograph everyplace and everywhen that both 'suits my 
fancy' and 'I can learn from this,' however confused the notion 
of learning is. So there are videos of violent storms and 
steady-state landscapes, audio of 'theory conversations,' images 
of chitons, Western kingbirds, fungi, old-growth forests, 
friends, colloquia, performances, communication towers and 
disease models. 

I am writing about contagion, about the problematic of any 
boundaries, about the real within the virtual and the virtual 
within the real until these categories disappear, about 
entanglements that would have seemed inconceivable a few decades 
ago, about contaminated digital regimes and the breathing and 
cicatrice of the analog, about the world which is worlding and 
unfolding. And about the inconceivable detailing of worldings, 
how contagion and contamination tend towards wear, and loss, and 
utmost annihilations; how the trace itself disappears into what 
I've termed the 'scorching of the scorched,' a bad phrase for a 
bad absenting. Azure's grandmother, in Las Cruces, went over and 
through a detailed family history I found close to unbelievable 
in its amazing detailing; of course this is one family, one side 
of one family, one side of one side of one family, and so 
forth, and the records themselves are, for me, unbearably 
fragile and perishable, and with each and every death in the 
world, every landslide and flood, worldings are lost and turmoil 
is the (dis) order of the day; this is what has been termed the 
inconceivable fragility of the good in catastrophe theory, that 
beyond that path which, for example, might result in a file or a 
book, there are so many other paths of disappearances that 
ultimate win out. Did dinosaurs have proper names?

almost running away with me.)

Rhetorica ad Herennium II xxix 46: The Summing Up

The Summing Up gathers together and recalls the points we have 
made - briefly, that the speech may not be repeated in entirety, 
but that the memory of it may be refreshed. 
(Loeb, trans. Caplan)

----------

'summing up.' No one knows how much time they have, and my work 
seems so kind of summing up, metacommentary, analysis. a 
summing-up In lieu of book or interview - a summing-up: sea yet 
direction Watanabe summing-up absence every other. To sum up, in 
other words, the film experience is hardly alienating, most 
artists, it is difficult to sum up what he is trying to do in 
simple Now Lyotard continues here, and the quotes are almost 
over: "To sum up ing." So to sum up here: The temporal power 
aspect has s/m components; it To sum up, in other words, the 
film experience is hardly alienating; however, reality _is._
