me you


don't know how much longer i can continue and there's no reason you should
care as well. if my writing doesn't push me to one or another limit, then
it fails, and if it does, part of me disappears. as kimberly says, maybe
she should stop dancing because half her body is wrecked and she doesn't
want to wreck all of it. but how do you measure the nausea, trembling, hy-
steria, sweats, that appear as a result of distended or fissured writing,
my fingers literally seizing, my mind unable to cope with its own produc-
tions? more and more i live only within the text; the phone rings less
than ever (where are you), and the email grows and grows. 

and the more the texts ride this uneasy edge, the more difficult they be-
come to produce, the greater the inner necessity for carving those fine
lines in the arms, legs, fingers, outlining what used to be flesh; in oth-
er _words,_ the greater the tension, discomfort, the more the text needs
dictate its existence, exigency _against_ the body - and this loop increa-
ses, negative feedback, until sleep becomes a portal of death, the waking
state becomes only a means of production, and as i have said elsewhere, i
write myself into existence, i write myself out of existence. 

this writing in and out, this aphorism, appears _behind_ a twenty-four- 
hour clock, above right, curling and releasing through the night and day, 
measuring the words produced, the substance which robs the body as heroin 
eventually would; time draws me out, time inscribes the words themselves.

my grave's a circumscription. the pain is that which is written as such,
the discomfort is the recognition that you are parsing a _function._
