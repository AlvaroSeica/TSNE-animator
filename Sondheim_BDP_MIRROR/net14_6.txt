THE GODS, CYBERSPACE



Rigveda X. 129:



1 Then was not non-existent nor existent: there was no realm of air, no

  sky beyond it.

  What covered in, and where? And what gave shelter?

  Was water there, unfathomed depth of water?

2 Death was not then, nor was there aught immortal: no sign was there,

  the day's and night's divider.

  That one thing, breathless, breathed by its own nature:

  apart from it was nothing whatsoever.

3 Darkness there was: at first concealed in darkness, this All was

  indiscriminated chaos.

  All that existed then was void and formless: by the great power 

  of warmth was born that unit.

4 Thereafter rose desire in the beginning, Desire, the primal seed

  and germ of spirit.

  Sages who searched with their heart's thought discovered the

  existent's kinship in the non-existent.

5 Transversely was their severing line extended: what was above it

  then, and what below it?

  There were begetters, there were mighty forces, free action here

  and energy up yonder.

6 Who verily knows and who can here declare it, whence it was born

  and whence comes this creation?

  The gods are later than this world's production. Who knows, then,

  whence it first came into being?

7 He, the first origin of this creation, whether he formed it all 

  or did not form it,

  Whose eye controls this world in highest heaven, he verily knows

  it, or perhaps he knows not.
