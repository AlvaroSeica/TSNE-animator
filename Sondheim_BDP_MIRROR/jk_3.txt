Ugly Netted Stockings


I can't say if I were a child any longer, without worrying about the long
arm of the law. I can't watch children or pretend to understand them. I've
got to bury children's sex thoughts before children learn to masturbate
and I have to pretend they don't masturbate and have no sex thoughts and
this is labor. I make myself blind in one eye (how smooth its interior),
reducing the world to a picture.

You are in the center of the picture of the world and I picture your ass-
hole, but I cannot picture penetration without the long arm of the law.
You are adult and in charge of your body and you offer your asshole to me
for my pleasure (how smooth your interior) but I cannot take it or res-
pond, nor can I forward a picture, blind in one eye, without the arm's
law.

The law of the arm is brute force, bending at the crook, severing the neck
from the body. It is a matter of physical strength, and I bow to it, off-
ering my asshole and mouth to its pleasure. It is not my pleasure because
it is the purity of coercion (how smooth its interior), and coercion is
_always_ pure because the body is cleansed and the situation is always al-
ready kept to one of simple leverage.

Blind in both eyes, I do not ask your name or race or sex or gender or
age, nor do I ask what you are doing with me. Blind in feeling and touch,
you have my permission, which you have taken anyway. What is control,
where a torso is concerned (how smooth my interior)? What is sex with the
arm's long law?
