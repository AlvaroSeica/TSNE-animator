Parable


One day Nikuko was walking by the banks of a raging river. She was reading
the Diamond Sutra, and stepped dangerously near the shoreline. A passing
monk came up to her and said, Please be careful, or you will drown. Nikuko
said, The Diamond Sutra will save me. The monk said, The Diamond Sutra has
never saved anyone. He grabbed the scroll from her and threw it in the
river. Nikuko, furious, jumped in after it, and with much difficulty
brought it back to shore. The monk said, On the other hand, everyone saves
the Diamond Sutra.
