opera of pain and love





pain fell from god's lips like pomegranate seeds



there is always a just amount of pain in the world



pain slides down god's chin, red and juicy



embryonic, we huddle against the papery smooth flesh



like a little baby, i love to lick the skin of god



we love to lick the pearly pink pearlescent maroons dribbling

down our throat



dribbling chapped tiny rounded berry heads



harsh painfulnesses criss-cross nipples, and o lovely neck so long

and longing god





"and there is always final longing if only for the music



"for here is what it is, opera and oratorio,

our spaces those of music



"and the blankness of the screen is that no one _sings_ in conversation,

opera's built on paradox



"and there is always final longing if only for the music



"no, what's left the body, left of the body, the haunting the trace

or song is what leaves the body, like breath, like soul

song like a sneeze when the spirit is expelled

so song like death as well, transfiguration, oratorio



"and there is always final longing if only for the music

the space of the dark screen, the place narcissus where music echos

the reverberation of the house of opera

what's longing but reverberation, that is what i think



"and there is always final longing if only for the music

even when we see ourselves, reflected in the screen

even when we see ourselves, speaking in the screen



"the image dark and dim, words covering ourselves invisible



"and there is always final longing if only for the music



"and pain fell from god's lips, like pomegranate seeds"
