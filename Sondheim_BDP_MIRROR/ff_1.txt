  This is a recurrent image for me: a _period_ representing the sun, and
  the distance to the earth calculated by the rough angle subtended; I
  think here the distance is somewhat correct; the earth of course would
  be a mere speck, dustmote at the distance. So it goes in this universe
  of tiny ascii; with closed eyes, flares cross the space, radiation from
  the corona breathes and diffuses; the earth's shadow turns a thin nee-
  dle to the right.
