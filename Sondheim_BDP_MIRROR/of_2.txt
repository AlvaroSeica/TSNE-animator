The history of radio is merged with the history of the electromagnetic, 
and given the movement towards packet and protocol, it is interesting to 
observe a movement from externality to internality, from brass spheres 
through the Wimhurst generator, from the crystal detector through the 
audion. Within the audion, and early triode, the filament glow was 
visible, an electronic hearth boiling off electrons. This was the analogic 
pulse of vacuum-tube radio, a pulse of light and heat and the quietest of 
sounds still sought by rock guitarists and audiophiles alike. Transistors 
internalized current into the literal black-box, and integrated circuits 
and circuit boards eliminated almost all of the hand-wiring. With the 
digital, the unit becomes tight, compact, although as always, still hack- 
able; repairs are another matter. The analog was a transitive filter, 
passing along the cosmos within rough bandwidth; the digital is active 
sampling. The transparency of the analog was reflected in the transparency 
of the radios themselves (capacitors and transformers etc. notwithstand- 
ing); the opaqueness of the digital, the complexity of the protocols and 
their arbitrariness, is reflected in the opaqueness of CPUs. It's both 
ironic and fascinating that mod cases now bring the hearth-glow back into 
the heart of the machine, with lights that do nothing but illuminate 
silent circuitry. We still believe we are among beings; we always will, 
and that is part and parcel of our cosmic reach, no matter how mediated it 
becomes. The mistake is to take the mediation and machinic for things 
themselves; certainly, on the level of _object,_ and certainly not on the 
level of _function._ We design within the imminence of potential wells, 
both analog and digital; otherwise we would never hear a thing.

believe me hon, this took a heck of a long time to make. why i didn't 
think i'd get through it. first there were all these places and some of 
the images were pretty much a wreck. and i couldn't find them all that 
easy; they were scattered hither and yon as anything's likely to be after 
a few weeks or so. once i got the images the whole thing took on a 
different character, a really big video, and i had to narrow it down for 
the net. i tried over and over again with the latest software but nothing 
seemed to work, so i went back to an older system. meanwhile i had to 
import the sound from somewhere and it seemed thin so i doubled it, 
nothing like a whoosh to give a kind of nervous quality to the whole 
thing, like i was playing guitar with one too many or one not enough, 
something in a between-state, i didn't know whether i was coming or going. 
finally it seemed i had another masterpiece so i thought why not, i'd give 
it to the public like another one of them last hurrahs that i keep having, 
some call them epiphonies or something like that, seems more phony than 
anything to be, but won't play on a phonograph, you know, needs one of 
them newer things to make any sense out of it all. not sure there is any 
sense to it but thought, heck, why not, i'd give it to the public like 
another one of them last hurrahs

Hey, long face!

Why the pigeons!

Pigeons are generalists, adapting to widely varying environments. As an 
example, here are two images taken at Laguna Beach; in both birds are 
resting on the sand, in a manner exactly the opposite of East Coast birds, 
even under roughly the same conditions. One can only assume that the 
behaviour is cultural, learned. http://www.asondheim.org/girlspeertoo.jpg 
and http://www.asondheim.org/girlspeer3.jpg . Yes indeedy, successful 
birds are generalists!

The Pain of the World, is there any?


If I write this poem to you, is it literal?
The sky closes over it, but does it?
The world's fury kills us all, but can it?
Nature is as violent as ever.
There is no justice in the world for strays, weeds, vermin,
whatever we call what we don't want. That is true.
Humans are strays, weeds, vermin, one to another, but are they?
I would see them dead, I would see the President dead, but will I?
I am frightened. Every night I dream of crashes, plane or car,
or just human against human. That is true. The violence wakens me.
Outside, people are doing nothing in particular, but are they?
The animals here lead delicate lives. Snake, frog, and cat are
rescued, everything hides in fear, but does it?
This year, the world totters on the brink of catastrophe. It does
not, the world does not totter, the earth pushes back like a plate, 
but does it?
I walk across the earth and it pushes under me.
It pushes harder, I think, but I may be wrong.
The dead are on the earth, then under then no more, but are they?
The dead claw up, but do they?
Transformed into oil, gas, diesel, but are they, they drive our
big cars, but do they?
The literature of pain is painful, but is it?
Designed to withstand suicide, it totters, but does it?
Does literature totter? The world does not.

Confusion of the Split


I keep searching for the _split_ everywhere, the appearance of the 
discrete which can, but must not, be rendered impotent / futile. There are 
dyadic theories - Laing, some communications theory, but these specify 
resonances among entities that need not be clearly defined. There is the 
ontological theory of quantum mechanics, in which electrons _are_ 
particles, in which the real is relatively grounded. There are theories 
beyond theories, theories I can't hope to understand, matrices of 
theories. There is everyday behavior among the signs and sign-systems of 
the world, and all of the sign-systems are far more culturally ideogram- 
matic, non-system / culturally founded, than first appearance indicates.

The digital lies _either_ in fabrication or one-on-one codes, or deeper, 
on the quantum level. 

Let us at least momentarily call it the discrete. Perhaps a distinction 
can be made - _digital_ technology, but _discrete_ as epistemological (and 
perhaps ontological) split.

The discrete is characterized by its lack of continuity with the analog.
A spike, fold catastrophe, wave function collapse, are, perhaps discrete.

A digital recording, for example, a CD, is discrete only in relation to 
the potential wells of conventionally-bound domains. A CD is analogic as 
an object; the 0s and 1s _resolve._ However, given a decoding/playback, 
the hills and valleys _register_ as 0s and 1s. The sound transforms back 
into the analogic through the playback system (speaker, earphone, etc.).

The registration of the 0s and 1s are dependent upon an conventionally- 
adopted _protocol._ We've been over this territory. The protocol appears 
_real_ although it functions only in relation to specific technology.

The coding is discrete on an ideal level; the signals themselves have 
onset and trailing. But within the given potential well of the technology, 
they _read_ as discrete.

Your money or your life: discrete, yes, or no; it veers. -money = +life, 
but (+money = -life) = -money. Life is an _entanglement._

All choices are braided, contingent, contiguous. The the discrete is 
always a barrier.

A vast distinction must be made between discrete _codes_ which are 
designed conventionally systemic, and what might be termed the _external 
discrete,_ i.e. stochastic, an appearance, unplanned-for. The difference 
between a digital CD and particle decay. This is the fundamental 
difference; one we construct with what is given to us, the other is given
to us.

I would think that the digital/constructed barrier can always be circum- 
vented; the discrete of the world, however, like the analogic, is _just 
that._

==

(In relation to _ideality,_ the discrete is simpler; any given integer, 
for example is E or -E, even or not-even. If the integer ends on {02468}, 
it's even. The sets E and -E are complementary, discrete; their inter- 
section is the null set, and their union constitutes the set of all 
integers. On the other hand, in non-ideal life, the life-forms of the 
every-day world, there may be for example a number of plums which are 
neither odd nor even - for example, pluots may or may not be included, 
hybrids may veer off, partially-eaten plums, seeds, etc., all form fuzzy 
cases.

(Now with the plums, let us open a distribution center: It is then 
economically necessary to count plums. The raster/protocol is created, the 
result is a digital screening.))

Discrete < on and off | 0 and 1 | other sign and other sign > Digital 
implementation.

In this scheme, the protocol is scheme / noise within the system:

[Referent | operative field] < Implementation > Digital mapping
....^..............^..................^.................^..........
0-resonance|boundary delineation|protocol-parasite|machinic display
(idiotic)   (circumscription)   (cultural convention)   (economy)

(On and on and on... stumbling into science, realms of ignorance.)

Journey of the Radicals

Looks like sun at three to five in the afternoon. Abscond or default with 
what I can make out of the feet. No, not at all, not even one. Mother of 
vinegar, the wine! Seize the hand, hunt with it, angle it upward! Mend 
first, then patch the billion with a tree - a billion of them make a 
forest. Eat a meal in the afternoon with a roof over your head. The arena 
is on the plain with a port at one end connected to a valley. I'm going to 
ask you to requisition me for a particular service at this time. I will 
use then the divining rod, tell you everything you want to know. Come. I 
see low walls, a ward, all resting on the earth. Did I tell you about the 
plain? The village name is "Earth" as well. We're going there. No, not 
again! Take a step, just one pace, then stop in that direction. This is 
the beginning of prophecy. Arrange the cloth; we'll make a roof over our 
heads for our afternoon meal. We're on our way. Just like a human being to 
extend herself. Don't stop, even though your heart is afraid. Open out, 
scatter yourself to the billions. Here, I'll give you a hand. We have to 
register at the bamboo gates of the village port. Did I tell you about the 
valley? This is the class of Radicals; beware of Pu! The village Board has 
given us permission to pass to P'u.

at 3am in the morning it's the dark night of the soul part 69

23 days into the residency, i've done nothing
i am waiting for my physicist to tell me the yes/no of the wave equation
i am waiting for a job to descend from god forever
i am waiting for death so everyone will be relieved
this body will be relieved, that's for sure, maybe my sister for that 
 matter
when i die i will miss azure forever, now i just do not deserve her
my guitar and shakuhachi will miss me and my long lonesome sound
dear god, i am tired, as my friend tom might say, of scrambling
 upon the face of the earth, it is hard scrabble times i might say,
 now god, do something about it, and while you're at it, cure disease,
 save the animals and plants, save the innocent, almost all of us,
 end disease, end poverty, paint a smile upon heaven's face
24 days and i still will have done nothing
today we are releasing a california toad back into the wild, we are
 searching for surplus equipment, our teeth are fine, i no longer sleep,
 do not want to return to new york where there is so much sickness
 and pollution, dear god i may want to die before my time, but not that
 way
i want to echo space into space, i do not know enough electronics, this
 space loop magnetic field receiver transmitter antenna, such a sudden
 pulse!
i am about to lose my website, jim andrews, august highland, simon biggs,
 simon penny, will be glad, it is ragtag, just a bunch of stupid files,
 last night i would step on them, they didn't budge, they just sat around,
 sometime soon i will sneak in and erase them
my meditation on analog and digital, i can't even distinguish between
 digital and discrete, is unbearably lazy, i know that in my heart, but
 today i wanted to see the one-armed teenager in the fourth of july parade
 in huntington beach, but she passed invisibly by, she was a wonder-surfer
 and is still a wonder-surfer, i am reading microbiology
microbiology says, 'exchange with me'
now i will try to sleep again, recently it has been all plane and car
 crashes, violent beatings, houses falling apart, einstuerzende neubauten,
 curved roads narrowed to points, all in the 3am dark night of the soul,
 and a war and a war and a war
soon i will have my forty-three lines, i did not mention the measure of 
 all things

sondheim's Home stret4
    stret4 - very low frequency radio spikes stretched out 100-10000 
times. recorded with Sony mini-disk, edited in CoolEdit. the digital 
stretch collapses to fundamental operating frequencies which then are 
parsed in relation to the original content; i.e. this is what happens. 
unlike analog stretch - which bottoms out into silence or parasitic noise 
- digital stretch tends towards continued spikes. 
sondheim's Home stret1

VLF acoustic

==

at the moment I'm typing and feeding this into a motion detector which is 
reproducing the words at an unholy rate; you can hear the result if you 
dare, listening to the mp3 that will eventually come out of this. In the 
meantime I'm watching the result on a screen, simultaneously typing and 
recording the strange mechanisms that are underway....

now for a moment will say something at quite great volume - ok now back 
into it, see what happens on the recording, goodbye.

http://www.asondheim.org/compu.mp3
http://www.asondheim.org/compu2.mp3

frequency raised into audible domain
the motion detector is acoustically coupled to a metal table coupled to a 
cement floor. the room has a number of resonances. objects on the table 
include the laptop, a large (linux) desktop and small flat-screen monitor. 
the desktop contributes; the other objects are too small and loosely 
coupled at best.

"Recently I've been at a loss in relation to my work. My projects are just 
that, projects; they could stop now or go on forever. I want to work on a 
'summing up.' No one knows how much time they have, and my work seems so 
utterly disparate. I'm in a permanent state of being distraught. What I've 
done up until now is nothing but spew."

digital touch of the avatar
http://www.asondheim.org/shouldher.mov
oh how i wanted to be there
this isn't true, it's a construction, there's no avatar,
there's only an image, there's no touch, there's just conflation,
there's just dictionary not numeric ordering, there's just, there's just
something or other gnawing at the touch and the shoulder and the wire
bending tenderly to touch the shoulder

vlf audio


3 vlf audio recordings in cement room; probe4 = guitar acoustically 
coupled only; nervoussystem = heart/body sounds; probe3 = local ambient

to be honest i haven't heard anything like these; they are elephantine (in 
the sense of elephant hearing bandwidth) raised 71-80%

if vlf radio = digital collapse/decay (and does it?); vlf audio = analog
spread across the floor of the imaginary real

                                        - for Alan Seeger


there is something one will always know
our generation is the last to go

we're born, great-grandparents whisper down like ghosts
then pass away, we learn that there are hosts
of others, those we will not know,
our generation is the last to go

grandparents age, wither, die before their time
we're on their hinge, we're entering our prime,
or so we think, there's something more they know,
our generation is the last to go

our burdened parents follow us, their friends
surround us, until it's clear their ends
aren't ours, we wither in their dying, for they know
our generation is the last to go

and now, we're almost there, our children know
our generation is the last to go



In lieu of book or interview - a summing-up:


My work deals with the relationship of consciousness to the world 
vis-a-vis the mediation of problematic and 'dirty' symbolic domains.

My work deals with the wonder of the world as new bandwidths, vistas, 
histories and geographies, are made available.

My work deals with the problems of foundations, Absolute, primordial, 
originary, in terms of debris and scattering.

My work is a continuous dialog, itself scattered among distributions.

My work evades biography, diary, autobiography, the anecdotal, whilst 
plunging into the simulacra of personal narratives.

My work exceeds itself, resonates with itself, with others; the others 
inhabit my work which curls around fictivity.

My work is my obsession, to an unhealthy degree; however, when filled with 
despair, there are moments of exaltation as distant shores are glimpsed.

My work is fearful of being found out; it is worried close to death.

My work is a stripping away of irrelevance; my back to the wall, I inhabit 
the world.

My work is a constant meditation on the world, on its diffuseness, its 
encapsulations, circumlocutions, circumscriptions.

My work has pretensions towards the philosophical and the scientific; I 
strip my work away from my work as well.

My work touches language, body, and sexuality, all in relation of an inert 
real.

My work insists on the fragility of the good, of stasis, of permanence; it 
embraces the plasma, is swallowed by holocaust, dissolves in detritus.

My work covers the same ground repeatedly.

My work is simultaneously excess and denudation, artifice and natural 
deployment, ornament and structure, text and subtext, suture and wound.

My work is simultaneously hypothesis and hypothetical, a proffering or 
wager.

My work inscribes my work, deconstructing inscription and the walls 
surrounding the Torah.

My work hedges and devours death; I work furiously, death will allow even 
this and one other final flourish.

My work penetrates to the state of inversion; what is negative, is 
positive, and what is positive, negative.

My work is based on the fissure, not the inscription; it is based on 
substance, not dyad, on ruptured continuities, not positives and 
negatives.

My work is a collapsed ecstatic; my work is a collapsed aesthetic.

My work presses the systemic until it breaks; my work is a broken work, 
construing breakage, irruption of subtext into text, symbolic into 
subtext, substance into symbolic; my work breaks the inscriptive chain 
itself.

My work carries equivalence across media, genidentity across protocols and 
virtualities, sexualities across avatars and bodies, politics into the 
flesh-heart and ideological strangulation.

My work is discontinuous on the surface, tending towards stylistic 
extremes.

My work explores epistemologically and ontologically shifted bandwidths; 
my work brings the uttermost into the vicinity.

My work explores the desperate exigencies of the flesh, the shock-tactics 
of annihilation-creation, the degeneration of generators.

My work tends towards the unaccountable, the unaccounted-for; my work 
emphasizes the inconceivable.

My work inhabits originary past and indeterminate future, locating the 
plasma at the former, and the final outpost of substance at the latter.

My work runs from wavelengths universe-spanning to particle wave-lengths, 
listening everywhere; my work is a reporting from the limits.

My work inhales information-annihilation, being-annihilation, its own 
absence and every other.

My work inflates, exhausts; I have a desperate relation to my work; I tend 
my work in the meager hopes of its survival beyond me.

My work is its own; my work is centered in the dissipated locus of the 
histories of the self; my work is beyond my work.

My work occurs within non-aristotelian logics, within logics of non- 
distributivity; my work occurs within dusts and radiations; my work exists 
in relation to the death of the symbolic.

My work decodes my work; my work brings the code of work, the code of 
labor, to the surface.

My work is codework, operational research for the flesh; my work abjures 
absolute frameworks, definitive infinities.

My work explores the inaccessibly high-finite, the inaccessibly low- 
finite, numeric flux dissolution into physical-material real.

My work is the future of philosophy, the future of intellectual work, of 
the propriety of the intellectual; my work is the afterthought of the 
past, the afterthought of the future, the thought of thought and its 
draining.

'My work' or 'my work' but one may say '*' in lieu of the phrase; my work 
is a place-holder, shifter.

My work is neither this nor that; my work is not both this or that; my 
work is vulnerable.

My work is analog-stumble, digital clarification; the real is inescapable 
and production is discrete; my work is never done.

My work is trauma-therapeutic; my work is beyond that, bypasses that, 
circumvents that; my work is unconscious, of the dream of the real, of the 
dream of a real; my work stands on its own, ignores me; my work is in 
spite of me; my work is a collocation; my work circumscribe confusion; my 
work is insistent; my work is philosophy in the highest and lowest degree; 
my work is the world's unconscious; my work is the true world of the 
dissipation of worlds, of the imminence and immanence of death; my work is 
a bulwark and a fiction; my work is non-fiction, languorous; my work is 
neurasthenic; my work is the neurosis of the world; my work is never 
done.

State of new media from strawberry fields forever -

The work I'm doing isn't much different from the work you're doing.
It will disappear when the net goes down or when it's no longer tended.
Nobody tends things forever.
It's amazingly ephemeral; there's nothing to it; it's stillborn, passed
in email or on a website, that's all.
It's not as if we're contributing to the well-being of humanity; the
idea that art makes any sort of social or political difference is long
outmoded, repeatedly proven wrong.
We're not even making paintings which have a modicum of a chance of
survival, 'being as how' they're concrete, inert, almost idiotic things
(in the sense of Rosset or Sartre).
Certainly we haven't made any contribution to physical theory or the
sciences in general, and our work is rarely entertaining.
At our performances and readings, only the rest of us show up.
The 'culture' such as it is, follows mass media, corporate distribution
systems, subtended radicalities; the best one hopes for is museum
sponsorship.
We've saved no one's lives through our art - turn the machine off, and
we're pretty much done for.
We engage in outmoded theories, bouncing one theorist off another, as if
any of it mattered in the universe at large.
We work through fast-forward intellectual fashions, situations in which
phenomenology, existentialism, postmodernism, deconstruction, and so forth
- name your 'movement,' name your theorist - are considered outmoded, as
if philosophy had advanced since Heraclitus.
We ignore scientific theory, or borrow from it, on a simplistic or meta-
phoric level, as a form of legitimation, as if we're somehow connected
with scientific 'advances.'
We confuse science with technology, substituting cleverness for any real
disciplinary understanding, in fields ranging from psychoanalysis through
physics.
Our theoretical work is written as if it somehow matters, somehow says
something about the world, which we hardly understand.
We substitute cultural politics for political action and depth; we ignore
war or illustrate it.
We entertain ourselves endlessly, as if our work had nothing to do with
entertainment (some might call us failed comedians, novelists, what have
you, substituting surface transformations for that hypothetical depth that
seems to infest the canon).
I am guilty of all of the above.
We go on and on and on...

Moth Radio -


an unpublished letter by Edwin Way Teale found in a copy of Near Horizons, 
Dodd, Mead, and Company, NY, 1942, bought at Heights Books in Brooklyn, 
NY, May 2005 -


Edwin Way Teale
93 Park Avenue
Baldwin, L. I. 
New York

January 10, 19(4/5)3   */typewriter overstrike; the date is unclear/*

Mr. Harold Watson,
68 William Street,
New York City,N.Y. */sic/*

Dear Mr. Watson:

	So far as I know, the hypothesis that the Cecropia and other moths 
may employ a kind of radio in attracting their mates, is merely an 
interesting theory unsupported by concrete evidence. There have been 
numerous suggestions that the insects have some sixth sense or other 
mysterious faculty. I don't think that either you or I can say with 
absolute finality that they do or do not. But I am sure that the burden of 
proof is on the person who makes such a proposal rather than vice versa. 
Until more evidence that */sic/* I have seen so far is brought forth, I, 
personally, will continue to believe that the acts of these amazing little 
creatures are governed by the senses we know rather than by some vague or 
mysterious factor whose existence remains to be proved. Unless the scent 
organs are also the centers of the "moth radios," I don't see how we can 
get around the experiments which reveal that male moths fly to the scent 
organs rather than the moth itself--or even to a container in which the 
female has rested rather than to the female herself when she is enclosed 
in an airtight container from which no odor can escape. And radio waves 
can go through glass. It is an interesting subject, but, as I say, the 
burden of proof is on the proponents of the new and radical theory and 
researches */sic/* should be made before such a theory is accepted, even 
tentatively.

Most Sincerely Yours,

Edwin W. Teale

UNITED STATES NAVY DEPARTMENT HYDROGRAPHIC OFFICE

I've been poring over this book, which presents signals by sound, flag, 
semaphore, morse, and flashing light. Each medium has similar problems:
1 How to accommodate other languages than English (which is the 
default); 2 How to distinguish code from meta-code. 

In terms of the latter, for example, the International Flags and 
Pennants, are the following:

Afirm, Baker, Cast, Dog, Easy, Fox, George, Hypo, Int, Jig, King, Love, 
Mike, Negat, Option, Prep, Queen, Roger, Sail, Tare, Unit, Victor, 
Gillian, Xray, Yoke, and Zed; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0. But there 
are also Repeaters: 1st Repeat, 2nd Repeat, and 3rd Repeat; and a CODE 
or answering pennant (red and white vertical stripes). 

So that for example:

Art. 69. When several flag hoists are displayed simultaneously they are 
to be read in the following order: (a) Masthead, (b) Triatic stay, (c) 
Starboard yardarm, (d) Port yardarm.

Art. 70. When more groups than one are shown on the same halyard, they 
must be separated by the tackline and be read in the numerical order of 
their superiority.

Physical support, meta-symbol, symbol, and image/imaginary intertwine.

Art. 78. Similarly, if she [the ship] can distinguish the signal but 
can not _understand the purport_ of it, she should hoist the 
appropriate signal VB, signifying, "Signal is not understood though 
flags are distinguished."

The Use of Substitutes (Repeaters)

Art. 79. The use of substitutes is to enable the same signal flag to be 
repeated one or more times in the same group while still only carrying 
one set of flags. For instance, it is obvious that without substitutes 
such a group as AAA or 1000 could only be made if three sets of signal 
flags were carried. By the use, however, of three additional signal 
flags, called substitutes (named first, second, and third substitutes 
respectively), any 2, 3, or 4 letter group can be hoisted by means of 
a single set of flags.

How to Spell

Art. 86. Names in the text of a message which is being signaled by 
flags are to be spelled out by means of the alphabetical signals which 
consist of--

Answering pennant over E (Alphabetical signal No. 1.) Indicates that 
until alphabetical signal No. 3 is made, the letters following do not 
represent signals from the code, but represent the letters of the 
alphabet spelling a word.

Answering pennant over F (Alphabetical signal No. 2.) Indicates the end 
of a word being spelled or the dot between initials.

Answering pennant over G (Alphabetical signal No. 3.) Indicates that 
the spelling of words is completed, and that the signals which follow 
are to be looked up in the code in the usual manner.

In Morse Signaling, beyond the Alphabet, Numerals, and Punctuation, 
there are Procedure Signals and Signs:

Call for unknown ship and general call - AA AA .- .-   .- .-
Answering sign - TTTTTTTTTTT... ---------...
Space sign - II ..   ..
Break Sign - BT -...-
Erase sign - EEEEEEEEE... ..........
Repeat Sign - UD ..--..
...
Repeat word or group before WB .-- -...
Ending sign - AR .-.-.
From - De -.. .
You are correct - C -.-.
Repeat back - G --.
Message received - R .-.
Word (plain language) received T -
I am unable to read your message owing to light not being properly 
trained or light burning badly - W .--
International Code groups follow - PRB .--. .-. -...

Semaphore Alphabet signaling consists of the following:

A, B, C (answering sign), D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, 
S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, ATTENTION, BREAK

The _Signal Code_ itself is complex - 1, 2, and 3 letter combinations 
for content, 4 letter combinations for location (i.e. AODR = Cape 
Sacratif) and name (i.e. ship name).

The _content_ is based on an alphabetical listing of English phrases 
equated with the letter combinations, both in _independent alphabetical 
order._

Single letter signals are used for primary communication and begin:

A - I am undergoing a speed trial.
B - I am taking in or discharging explosive.
C - Yes (affirmative).
D - Keep clear of me - I am maneuvering with difficulty.

and so forth.

Double letter signals are based on major _alphabetical thematic 
content_ - for example the first several themes are:

ABANDON
ACCIDENT
AFLOAT AND AGROUND
AIRCRAFT

and the last several themes are:

WEIGHING
WHISTLE OR SIREN
WIND

So for example:

WHISTLE OR SIREN

ZK - I shall signal with whistle or siren during fog.
ZL - You should sound whistle or siren at intervals.

WIND

ZM - Direction and force of wind is.
ZN - What is the wind direction and force?
ZO - I am dazzled by your searchlight,s; douse or lift it, them.

The three letter codes begin with numerous lists:

Points of the compass:

NNE - JUQ
NE by N - JUO
NE - JUM

Points:

ABH - 2 points on the starboard bow.
ABI - 3 points on the starboard bow.

Degrees:

ACA - 60 degrees to starboard
ACB - 70 degrees to starboard

Standard Times:

ACS - + 9 Japanese central.
ACT - + 8 Chinese (Japanese western).
ACU - + 7 Straits Settlements

and so forth. Grammatical meta-symbols:

ADW (An order); AEW Do not; ADX I (do); AEY (He, she, or it, does not);

AFW do I?; AGG Did I? etc. - all followed by the proper verb.

Punctuation:

AGQ - Period (FULL STOP).
AGR - QUESTION mark?
AGS - The following is in PLAIN LANGUAGE.
AGT - The following is a REQUEST.
AGU - The following is ADVICE or a SUGGESTION.

and so forth.

The GENERAL VOCABULARY proper is doubly alphabetized. For example:

...
LTV - QUESTION, s (Interrogate, ion).
Questioning - Am, Is, Are.
LTW - Questioned - Has, have, ing.
LTX - QUICK, ly, ness.
LTY - As quickly as possible.
LTZ - Too quick, ly, for, to.
LUA - QUICKEST, The.
LUB - QUICKSAND,s.
LUC - QUIET, ly, ness.
LUD - QUININE.
LUE - QUINSY.
LUF - QUITE
LUG - R., RACE
Race,s (Tide race) - RLJ
LUH - Race,s (Propellers, Engines, etc.).
Racing - Is, Are.
LUE - Raced - Has, Have, ing.
LUJ - Radiator,s (Cooling).
LUK - RADICAL, ly.
LUL - RADIO,s.
Radioing - Am, Is, Are.
LUM - By radio.
Operator,s - KEO
Receiver,s - MAB
Transmitter,s - PHU
Radio apparatus - BCP
LUN - Radio direction finder,s.
LUO - Fitted with radio - Am, Is, Are.
LUP - Not fitted with radio - Am, Is, Are.
...

This double-indexing depends, with the triplets, on strict dictionary 
ordering; and, with the referent, on SUBJECT / examples in dictionary 
form. There is no implicit link between signifier and signified; for 
example:

NSD - SOS. (Interestingly, the SOS triplet is omitted.)

After the triplets, the book presents a DECODE section, which contains 
additional symbols useful for "decoding messages from ships or stations 
not using the English edition." For example:

SPP Dressing, a (Surgical).
SPQ The least.
SPR Last month.
SPS Half way.

These would be used by an English speaker working with incoming partly
in another language.

So far we are only dealing with a. English language and b. standardized 
punctuation. It should be noted in terms of the latter, for example:

Art. 147. There is no equivalent of the apostrophe "s" (possessive) in 
most foreign languages, and it has, therefore, been omitted from the 
code. The possessive sense must be expressed by means of the possessive 
"Of (Belonging to)." ...

and in terms of the former:

Art. 139. It is obvious that when making up the Italian edition of the 
code, each of these Italian words, which, it will be appreciated, have 
other meanings not expressed by the English word "report," must be 
allotted a different code group. The following procedure has therefore 
been adopted. If a word, say, in English, requires more than one word 
to express its meaning in, say, Italian, and these Italian words are 
quite distinct from one another, the code group which has been 
allotted to the English word is inserted only in the Italian _decode,_ 
with the necessary Italian equivalents against it. These Italian 
words, when and if inserted in the Italian code, are assigned 
different code groups, which are then printed in the English decode 
but not in the English code. ...

Example 9. - Specimen decoded message.

STN - Picked up (Has, Have, ing) , Collected - Has, Have, ing.
EDR - Crew, s.
3 - 3.
CEC - Boat, s.
RCZ - Belonging to. , Of.
IBNS - S. S. Leme
RHL - Sunk - Has, Have, ing.
13 - 13th.
VFB - Instant. Current. Existing.
AGQ - Full stop.
RKD - Mine. My.
LDK - Next port of call.
AACF - Aden.
AGQ - Full stop.
AEM - I will <  >
OTB - Telegraph, s. , Telegraphing - Am, Is, Are.
TVJ - Name, s.
KVP - Person, s.
MWJ - Saved - Has, Have, ing.

Have picked up crews three boats belonging to S. S. Leme, sunk 13th 
instant. My next port of call Aden. I will telegraph names persons 
saved.

In all of the above, codes/metacodes/referent-trees all intermingle. 
Distinctions among the categories blur in favor of other exigencies. In 
some cases, i.e. signal flags, it's possible to add an additional 
pennant for clarification (i.e. CODE). In other cases, i.e. morse code, 
distinctions are more problematic, since they are made within the 
primary code lexicon of dot/dash/space. 

The ordering of the general vocabulary leaves no room for additional 
terms; i.e. between MXA and MXB there is nothing; to this extent the 
code remains highly discrete. (MXAA already implies either place or 
ship name.) The code encapsulates the major situations that might occur 
among mariners at sea (or air); everything else is spelled out. With 
the thousands of entries in the International Code of Signals, decoding 
occurs by means of lookup; it would be impossible to memorize all of 
them. There are parallels between this system and Chinese characters; 
in this sense, the International Code contains only 26 radicals, 
arranged in one to four groupings.

The "messiness" of the system has implications for anyone hoping for a 
clean and clear reading of "discrete" or "symbol" in relation to 
code-work - as in many other systems, heuristics takes over. While the 
system remains discrete on one hand (i.e. a limited number of signal 
elements), the referent "splatters" - it's difficult to contain, and 
the strategies of containment extend the usage of signal elements to 
meta-levels and beyond.

the island

no, nothing happens, nothing moves
some iceplants move in the foreground
is it an island or artificial coagulation
structures are oil pumps and attendant machinery

the island is perfectly poised
i do not know, does it float? surely it is anchored
sometimes in enormous seas islands have difficulty
perhaps this can float away

men live on the island for a week
i'm peering behind some iceplants
i couldn't see the men but could see the palms
the palms perhaps are real and perhaps not

what would anchor the palms?
what would anchor the men on the island?
what anchors the men anchors the palms
both are anchored to the earth and its bodhisattvas

http://www.asondheim.org/theisland.mov

the island is not an island
not an island is an island
if this is an island is it not an island?
if this is not an island is it an island?






Nine: The Album


Please download! Go to:

http://www.asondheim.org/nine/

There are nine guitarworks here, a full lp album's worth. 
These were recorded absolutely flat in a silent recording studio, one 
microphone, no equalization or effects.

The guitar is the old unlabeled Larson (?) parlor guitar, from around 
1910. It's tuned to D, more or less.

I'm happy with these pieces - all mp3s - they represent my stumbling or 
stuttering in relation to the scales/soundwork/chords I'm using. The labor 
comes through, which is important to me. (It represents literally 40 years 
of work.)

The pieces were recorded first take, within an hour and a half.

9 guitar works recorded flat with 1920 Larson parlor guitar.
Audio works from VLF (very low frequency) radio recording.
Audio works from VLF audio recording with frequency shifting.
Audio works with tottering granular synthesis.

A subset of VLF radio signals are ducted in the atmosphere.
Digital modifications of such signal transform ducting into 
inhabited space. Nearby movement in moist conditions couples
and uncouples antenna operation.

Subsonic VLF audio is the speech of worlds and buildings.
We bring you the resonant ducting of the world.

Into the world we bring the developing structure of fast guitar.
Organism makes itself felt, murmurs, disappears into plasma.
This is the order and disorder we identify with things.
We hold them tenderly, they are burning fiercely.

They are burning fiercely, we have no memory of ducts.
Our space and time are surface phenomena, ashes of inordinate
processes. Wave equations collapse and the digital is born.
The digital expands, leaving the things of the world behind.

Worlding and structure intermingle in discordant resonance.
We are listening to listening, hearing to hearing, ear to ear.

What happened to the fish?

http://www.asondheim.org/myrealwork.mov
http://www.asondheim.org/mytruework.mp4

I used to think I could work in tiny spurts, 30k was what
I told my students and that sufficed surely for a while, but
As the digital began to coalesce and approach the real,
It turned it it didn't matter what you or I might feel,
We had to adjust to the times. The analogic breathed down our necks,
And while the image turned truer, video retained its specks.
Soon we analyzed the image, found it was just the same as before,
And the video, already swollen, the same but a little bit more.
In the depths of the ocean I took the image with the fish,
Carefully erased it for the other, it's gone for you, I wish
It's disappeared and safe and snug within the tentacles and arms
Protecting it against carnivores who come to eat and do it harm.
I wanted to show you the smoothness of the digital jelly
Besides the tiny fish who would not wish it in its belly,
But glides nonetheless in and out following sun, moon, and tides
And there is so much more, I'm sorry for the megabytes, besides.

X-Ray Fuji


Fuji remains down to the silver grain; the original is sharp. But the 
grain dissipates; it refuses the exhaustion that height and brea/d/th
can bring. 

As for beauty, it is only skin deep. The skin is plastic; the sheen is
digital; the skin is digitized; the sheen spreads analogically across
the memory of skin and its absence.

The x-ray is plastic protrusion; its sheen is digital; the bones are
digitized. Buddha would visit the house of this woman and clothe her
with skin. The woman (who is Buddha) would visit the house of atmosphere,
house of air-with-no-harm.

Though we say 'a step', this connotes te whole body; that is to say, the 
whole body undergoes change; the aggregates of the whole body undergo new 
births, new growth-and-decays, and new deaths. If a hundred steps or a 
thousand steps are taken in the course of a walk, then a hundred or a 
thousand new births, new growth-and-decays, and new deaths take place in 
the whody. A step may also be divided into two, as the lifting-up 
aggregate and the laying-down aggregate of the foot. And in each single 
step, birth, growth-and-decay, and death must be noted. 

The same holds good with regard to all the postures of the body, such as 
standing, sitting, sleeping, stretching out, drawing in. Only, what is to 
be understood here is that all tired, wearied, inflammatory, irritative, 
painful states are changes in the continua of aggregates produced by 
temperature. Both in exhaling and inhaling, beginnings, middles and ends 
are all discernible.

The phase of continuance, of stability in the existence of the aggregates, 
is immediately followed by decay which, in connectioon with such matter, 
is called exhaustion or weariness. [...]

Exposition of Tirana-Parinna

The three salient marks or features are:

	1. anicca-lakkhana: the mark of impernanence
	2. dukkha-lakkhana: the mark of ill
	3. anatta-lakkhana: the mark of no-soul. [...]

Thus if we look with the mind's eye, the mark of impermanence in all the 
matter of the whole body will be clearly discerned.

strongly recommend this work, which is available second-hand online.)

My Sixty-Five Failures


I dread this.

My first failure is an inability to sleep through the night, no matter 
what; insomnia and nightmares occur constantly.

My second failure is a failure to relax, to take time out and enjoy 
things, to not see the world through pessimistic eyes.

My third failure is never to feel at home, anywhere, to remain nomadic no 
matter what, to be unable to inhabit a place.

My fourth failure is an inability to make money, to have a stable income, 
to stop this constant scrambling after decades of making-do.

My fifth failure is my real lack of university affiliation, to play the 
penniless scholar for the rest of my life.

My sixth failure is not to be accepted as a serious scholar, however that 
be defined.

My seventh failure is a lack of books of mine and others bringing together

Mommy


1938 All I wanted to do was to capture her! Remember her!
They said I did all those horrible things!

http://www.asondheim.org/mommy2.jpg

When she would come to me in the middle of the night!
Oh delusion! Oh illusion!
I'm all grown up! I need the Mommy! I need the Mommy to fuck-fuck! 
Oh elision! They weren't horrible! They were wonderful! Slurp!
All I have is the memory, the drugstore! The soda fountain!
Lana Turner, you are mine! 1943 I captured her!

Anthracite Casualties


The estimates of the number of men and boys dying in the anthracite 
minefields of Pennsylvania from the mid 1800s through the first few 
decades of the 20th century seem to vary a great deal. The particular 
volume illustrated below lists 1622 deaths for the three years 1910-1912. 
The fields covered a very small area, including Scranton and Wilkes-Barre, 
my home town. I believe the total deaths during this period reached 
50,000.

The 11 images are from an illustrated booklet, used to teach miners safety 
measures, as well as limited English. Most of the miners were from Eastern 
Europe. The images are from the Report of the Department of Mines in 
Pennsylvania.

Live Performance: No Audience: Recorded Screen for Playback



###



First try (not really satisfed with this):


open for business, this performance is open for business. 
this is or is not a performance. this is a moment in the 
history of western art. this is the distortion or social 
distortion of the movement of culture or cultural movement. 
hello hello out there can you hear me. i can't see you. i 
am blinded by the beauty of the united states of america.
i am blinded by you. by your beauty.
every day the world soars aloft into  the sky. the sky is 
welcoming, the sky turns sound into chaos. hello, i'm tired 
and hiding out in this corner of the world. can you see me 
here. hello hello (this is what one can say in the corner 
of the world.)
come in and stay awhile.
come in and stay awhile.
you might be aware of this as an improvisation. i am 
writing this just about at the speed you are reading this. 
now we'll see something. moving up and down affecting the 
atmosphere. you are seeing the atmosphere under effect. you 
are seeing just what - just what is that woman doing in the 
upper corner of the screen. it gets harder to hear things 
as things compress, join uselessly together, as if there's 
a message coming from the upper atmosphere. i am afraid 
there is, this is the message. something there is that does 
not fear the flesh, highspeed and in motion, this is the 
furious gaze of the onlooker of america. you get what I 
mean? we're twelve minutes into the _thing_ and it's hardly 
clear yet, neither to you nor to me. Degas' dancers have 
always disturbed me...
something there is that does not love the flesh, yes yes, 
what is the world but a series of emanations? the world is 
indefinite, the world is a series of emanations, things in 
constant motion, nothing fixed, nothing present but in the 
imagination's temporary hold on you. 
and you'll disappear soon enough.
hello, are you enjoying this? I hope you're watching this 
(personally I think it's terrific- but why wouldn't I?) -
large and electronic manipulation.
God, I'm trying to entertain you - I hope you can at least 
appreciate that? the sun sets furiously. no, the black sun 
sets furiously over the islands of greece. This is the 
running of all forms of emanations, atmospheric sounds, 
ghosts, wraiths...
I AM MEDIOCRE!
NO, I AM NOT!
NOR AM I PERFECT IN THIS PERFECT WORLD.
later that night, they considered this a sombre moment, 
something unthought-of in the history of human culture.
"It was the machine in them that did the talking, it was 
the machine in them that did the talking."
Hello, please come in, join us. We are PRESENTING at the 
moment. 
everyone is watching the train-wreck of the twentieth 
century. the world horrifies in the wreckage. Come in, 
please be my guest, you're welcome to sit and watch the 
videos for as long as you like. Thank you for coming! I'm 
glad you're here, I really am. Ah, perfect, how we 
stumbline through our beautiful lives.
one might say, "We're really "meandering" through the 
twentieth century?" or not....
Somehow these images seem incredibly sad... one, I 
gathered, nothing was heard. but here, that proved to be 
impossible; in fact, sound was everywhere, one just had to
At this point, the room went silent. Nothing made any 
sense, certainly not now. He had nineteen minutes to go, at 
least that, before "the world ran out."
Samuel thought, I'm being suffocated and I'm not sure why. 
The mah-jong game burned itself into his memory. Time and 
again, he'd go over it, but to no avail. It was all the 
same. The world! How beautiful! Only... something was 
missing...
The mountain doubled back with tremendous fury, driving all 
other landscape into oblivion.
I AM HOLDING MY BREATH. 
Now, I WILL RELEASE.
I know that when they entered the space, they knew that 
something was going on.
HI THERE! PLEASE COME IN AND BE SEATED! The show's maybe 
2/3 the way over, but it will begin again. Thanks so much 
for coming!
I know, it's not the same thing as if you see me here 
typing live, but that's the beauty of
Okay, I know you saw the car-wreck. 
It's late at night, I'll just, I don't know, LEAVE YOU 
ALONE FOR A MOMENT, and SLIP INTO 
SOMETHING comfortable...
Every movie has another movie...
How long can I hold your atention?
Really, thank you for staying; it's been wonderful. I hope 
some of the more... risque offerings didn't offend you, 
believe me! There are more risque offerings that I didn't 
dare show, with the open window and all. Still, one can 
breathe deeply, can't one?
Late at night... Was anything happening... in the darkned 
studio...
Hours passed... they didn't know what was happening to 
them... On the left, it's almost as if... as if ... as if  
... as if     ....
the dots were getting away from him. 
all right, there are three minutes left.
I want to end with... I'm not sure, really, I'm not, almost 
just about two minutes now... Of course thank you very much 
for coming.

Second and Final Try (quite satisfied with this):


Welcome Welcome Welcome! This is my friend, he is a very 
great dancer. Please don't be shy, please come in. Take a 
seat - over there, there should be some room, hardly anyone 
has shown up at this point. Maybe, ah well. In any case, 
I'm beginning, this is the world of emanations - you can 
CLEARLY see something is happening here, something... 
extraordinary, almost one might say, supernatural, the 
whole earth is full of radiations.... You can hear them, 
preternatural perhaps would be a better world, they're just 
beyond your pleasance... I record these, these emanations, 
these ghosts, there are more of them than are alive, more 
of them than are here in this room, right now. This woman 
is dancing to 'em. She is listening to the ghosts and 
making the ghosts appear. It is the saddest thing, as
as the ghosts, as the ghosts, the ghosts,
witness the disappearnce of their kindly earth... Such 
things as are destructive, as are deadly, for example the 
electronic substation across the street, what is that all 
about. More and more we are dominated by electronic 
emissions. LOOK AROUND YOU! THERE ARE NO MATERIALS OF ART 
HERE! THERE ARE ONLY RADIATIONS, ONLY NOISE, NOTHING ELSE

THIS IS THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD.

I HAVE BEEN THERE.
please please come in and sit down, have some time, spend 
some fun time with this, enjoy yourselves. You are 
witnessing, you are witnessing, the chaos of the world, 
what the world was like when ghosts roamend, those were 
times.
They are furious, these ghosts. They are furious with us. 
They are sucking us dry.
WE, WE, WE, WE, WE. Eliminate the comma: WE WE WE WE WE - 
we join together in our flight towards destruction, our 
personal best / fury:
We will become THESE MATTERS.
The machine in them is writing this. Or writing these, 
every writing is plural.
The body is its own machine. The tendency towards 
repetition... "is the greatest force for good in this 
universe." Please, I beg you, have a seat, stay a while, 
there's nothing frightening here, nothing untoward, 
whatever was sacred
is still sacred. And WELCOME! Please join us in our 
project. Look carefully, examine the interstices of the 
composition, what goes on before, and what comes 
afterwards, when least expected. These are times   when it 
is almost    dangerous to remain   alive.
We must    We must    bear
bear   these consequences   We must
We must    Measure    TO HONOUR
AND TO OBEY    YES YES YES PLEASE DO PLEASE    DO COME IN  
We are calling for help, these ghosts, they they, DESCRY us
late at night
late at night
Surely if they are coming for me they are coming for you. 
Surely if they are coming for me they are coming for you.
PLEASE PLEASE COME IN, make yourself at home as if this 
were YOUR HOME and these were YOUR THOUGHTS
SOMETHING IS VERY BROKEN.
please please pardon me you were
you were not meant to see this.
ah, you are wondering perhaps - Wait a minute, I'm sorry, 
give me a second -
You're perhaps wondering (that's better) what happens, what 
is the story?
There are a man and woman in the room.
The man holds up the woman. The woman falls. The man has 
contact with the woman. The man begins to fall. Someone is 
watching this. (You can hear the sounds of the future.) If 
we remain on this planet, after the nuclear war, this will 
happen. And this. And this will happen as well. A black sun 
will illuminate the sky and the sun will fall down over and 
over again. How sad it is to see the dusk.
As I was saying (before I interrupted myself), this is the 
time to come on in, no, "Come on in!" and make yourself 
comfortable! How sad the world is!
How comfortable! 
Now Hello, Hello, to the weather. Each will swell in turn 
and disappear. You will know "the weather." See how foreign 
planets tell so little when they have, have more than 
enough time, more than enough chance. This is no. 1. This 
is number 2. And this is "The Stormy Day" of number 3. And 
this is Titan, a very distant moon. Which is number 4. And 
this is number 5. "In the Water."
You are hearing, honestly, very low frequency (VLF) antenna 
coupling with the metal strings of a musical instrument. 
It's enough to raise the dead. The dead are being raised.
There are lessons to be drawn from this. 
"Nervousness is no excuse for the innocent, just as calm 
provides solace for the guilty." Once a pon, no, once upon 
a time in America. If you don't love this country, please 
leave it. Thank you. WELCOME! Come in and watch the show. I 
am making this show ESPECIALLY FOR YOU. I am not making 
this show FOR ANYONE ELSE. This is your special show. LOVE 
IT OR LEAVE IT. A momentary interlude while you 
contemplate....
This appears to be an armageddon moment. I honestly wish 
you would stay, I would give you something worth it, honest 
I would. Don't go away! I'm working on it! I'm still 
working on it!
You can see how the ... emanations... the machinery of the 
universe... all at work... all at once... Yes, yes, yes, I 
want to thank you, I want to thank you for coming. 
"I think we have all learned something here." (Exeunt all 
as the plane crashes in for a landing.)
