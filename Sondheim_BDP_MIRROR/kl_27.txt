Sermon on the Mount by Jennifer


The Real is so stupid and Insignificant, I am saying under the sign of
Clement Rosset do you know him? That it is inert, dull, repetitious and
Full of our Meanderings. So that We do not Face Face, that is a Moment 
of what might be a Considerable grain, have you looked at Face up close 
and then Wondered how your Theories fall apart in the Proof? Because I
cannot Do this for too Long, this Look at the Up-Close Face, I mean the
first Thing you Notice are Pores and other Holes everywhere There and 
in the Middle of such Hairs as you will never See at a Distance. So is
that an Unknown Horror to Dream of and not to Disparage as you might on
a fair Day from a Distance. You will know what I mean. It is never or
Nary a Code, Nary or Never a Discourse, when you are that Close that
it is as if the Bed left Marks impervious. I am Talking to You. Those
impervious Marks. You will look at Stains up close, why there are Stains
on this very Chair upon which I am sitting, Leaks from my Panties, you 
will know how Stupid the real is, you can almost Smell it. Up Close 
Like a Gulliver wandering, then I know you will Know the World which is
what Surrounds you. Then and Precisely then, When you can Speak, Then
you Will be ushered into Silence, nary a Thing to Say. Thus I might say
from a Distance, you will have been Done to by the World, but you must
Know, if the Last Thing, it is of your Doing.
