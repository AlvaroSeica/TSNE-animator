Fukuoka Diary, I


Your stories don't mean anything here, he said, "glaring at me." THIS is a
story, don't you understand?

I retreated with all my favorites, hunting for Olduvai tools, the atomic
cannon in the textile factory, the abandoned and sinking freighter, the
woman who lived with a donkey, walking through riots. 

They're useless now, he continued. "WE'RE ALL HERE." There's nothing you
can say to us.

He moved his three-cornered hat, tilted it down so his eyes were slits in
the dark underbelly of the world. How did he manage to keep the parrot on
his shoulder "was beyond me."

All my knowledge meant nothing! I could no longer count to ten, well yes I
could count, but the numbers didn't seem stable. Ha ha ha the assorted men
and women gathered around him, gold earings and teeth! I felt so inconse-
quential and I didn't know why.

Have a smoke, Thylacine, he said to me, "having a drag on his long-stemmed
pipe," and I recognized, for once, this most ancient of rites, carried out
for my benefit alone, in front of an appreciative audience.
