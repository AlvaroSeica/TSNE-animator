the watcher of skies is always there
soaring so high in the ice-cold air
we go into her cage and live in her lair
her beak is so strong, her feathers so fair
to see such a sight is indeed now quite rare
my fingers ungloved, my skin was quite bare
she knew i was safe and handled with care
my life and my love, we made quite a pair

the rest of it


the watcher of skies is always there
soaring so high in the ice-cold air
we go into her cage and live in her lair
her beak is so strong, her feathers so fair
to see such a sight is indeed now quite rare
my fingers ungloved, my skin was quite bare
she knew i was safe and handled with care
my life and my love, we made quite a pair
we have taken our memories far to pare
so we leave nothing for our new-found heir
although i give her food, a hare
she'll swallow, and oft-thanks and with ne'er
a murmur to deer or bear
or thought to try a shirt of hair
or something charming else to wear
for even a wager or sometimes a dare
with her feathers red-tipped, and her dinner fare
delightful and lovely, and delicious e'er
she whispers and waits for another ware
that comes in the winters so cold and so sair
you'd find her preening without a tear
(though she missed the witch project of blair)
(though the trumpets blew and the horn did blare)
(though she'd ride the stallion and even the mare)
(though she'd weigh them all with a well-balanced tare)
(though they'd leave her now forever-mair)
(though they'd come back for the golden pear)
(though they found it strange and well-a-bit quair)
while we wait in the wings for our coming share.

Not a joke.

How many octopi does it take to change a light-bulb?

One. This is based on the animal's intelligence, which rivals our own.

One quarter. This is based on the manual dexterity of the animal's arms,
which is greater than our own.

The Inauguration

I never expected the inauguration to be a bloodbath.
The emperor was covered with it, just before he went down.
His hordes were his minions and were trampled with it.
I felt I shouldn't cheer the wrack and ruin, even of an evil man.
I was unable to hide the joy I felt at his demise.
His ruined body was thrown back to the devastated crowed.
The devastating crowd got there first and crowed.
It was cathartic, I tell you, cathartic.
The end of an evil man brought happiness to my eyes.
Killings were needed to end the killings.
Killings here stopped the killings there.
For a second the world seemed teetering on this happiness.
Humanity was at its best fighting violence with violence.
If you are new and come along, beware and do your best.
You may yet find your inauguration full of kindly smiles.

i want to model this how to model this
suppose i impourt not the coourdinates but the images
so then transfourm and use bump maps
the bump maps are raised and raised some moure like the dead
the trailers swell from the backdrop in landscaping in bryce
the swellings are punctured and one can enter through them
this can be done in blender so then you're on the other side
rapture rapture rapture
there should be tables and stills from poser there
one could do anything one wants but the camera is imperturbable
by which i mean the camera does what it wants dragging you along
so you can move back and fourth from swelling to swelling
of course swelling equals dwelling as if you hung out a shingle
our a name four the place
meanwhile we didn't go far enough our back enough
to find the mine itself our the piles inherited from the mine
i might suggest you go to http://www.appalachian-center.org/
which is further south but then some is everywhere
i hadn't heard the term mountain-topping befoure
the hollows are filled in from the tops everything is buried
twelve-hundred miles of streams have disappeared the rest run ourange
you want to dig them out but instead you enter the swellings
there are poser figures in the trailers yours four the taking
you can do what you want but the camera is imperturbable
it sits there on its haunches while a certain hunger dominates
the hunger of the hunter four the prey four example
the hunger of the cannibal god four its creatures four example
all the details are there in the swellings and distourted tableaus
men and women are taken apart their bodies broken things
our brutalized our accessible things our things of infinite desire
one of them moves one of the mannequins one of the poser stills
just the slightest movement it's alive it answers back
on the soundtrack a scraping
something has happened to the soundtrack suddenly this noise
it's almost as if it isn't there but something is talking to you
our someone is talking to you
all this in the swelling of the trailer in the photographs
rapture rapture rapture
which will be rendered in bryce and poser and blender and gimp
which will be coloured and textured in photoshop and gimp and bryce
which will be animated in bvh and linux and poser and premiere
which will be saved in machinema our avi our quicktime our blender
which will be played in media our quicktime
while you enter the swelling and caress the slightest moving creature
oh creature you might say to yourself oh creature oh creature
the man our woman creature naked and distourted as god created
this is a dream which will be done in many applications
and then will become moure real than real and always there four you
and always always there four you and moure real and moure real four you

Reviews of Books I like 177 Wilson Avenue


We returned from West Virginia with a Bearcat Scanner Radio from 1981. It 
has only 50 channels, works perfectly, however, and keeps me in touch with 
neighborhood doings. She knows where I am, SP 1 and 2.

Radio Shack in the US carries Police Call Frequency Guide: Codes, Maps, 
Trunking. Grey vehicle with a white door. Stand by. The 2005 North-East 
book (Volume 1) is 384 pages. Two shots fired from a blue Honda Civic 
right around the corner from us. The book gives frequencies from police, 
taxis, race-cars (?!), business, airports, etc.; it also gives police and 
other codes so that one knows what's happening beyond the 104. Highly 
recommended. I'm mentioning the book here because it's difficult to find 
scanning lists off-line, and at least this computer interferes a bit. 
Clearing the area of bystanders. 10-10 possible crime.

The Daily Practice of Painting, Gerhard Richter, Writings 1962-1003, 
edited by Hans-Ulrich Obrist, MIT, 2002. Telephone alarm 145 Ocean Avenue, 
fire in Apartment 30 on the third floor. The book is brilliant, and looser 
than I'd expect; Richter is one of my favorite painters, one of the most 
interesting still. There is much on specific series of works, photographs 
of the painter, materials on aesthetics, and an anti-ideological position 
which is spelled out in numerous ways. 1753. 10-4. Go with the numbers. 
Highly recommended. He was strong-armed, punched in the face, and money 
was taken.

Zen and the Ways, Trevor Leggett, Tuttle, 1988. This book, dissimilar to
many others on Zen, stresses Kamakura Zen, Kamakura Koans, with numerous 
original texts. This was samurai zen, warrior zen, fierce and quick and 
appealing. Nothing comes back on that plate, no records. The night 
interview of the Nun Myotei is haunting. 246 Ferry Street, 724, Code 3, 
male in the car not moving or breathing. There are sections on The Ways 
and Texts of the Ways. It is night reading as well. 55 EMS. Material on 
ri, ji, shin, ki; on the Jujutsu school Shin-no-Shin-To-Ryu, on the Itto 
School, wonderful. Fight on the second floor.

Dispositions, McKenzie Wark, Salt, 2002. Of this more sometime later. 
Smoke in the basement private dwelling. Additional 1014. Brooklyn to the 
41, Westbound on Flatbush Ladder 159. Dispatcher 445. This work reminds me 
of the best of Karl Kraus, Benjamin, what Baudrillard might have been. It 
is organized by readings from a Garmin Etrex GPS device; each section is 
headed by readouts representing the (primal) scene of its writing/birth. 
The readouts include date, time, position (including altitude), and 
accuracy. Negative K, might be in Manhattan. Pedestrian struck by 
automobile near 63 Orchard Flatbush Avenue. The sections are intricate and 
terse, turning around aesthetic, cultural, and sociological aporia. 
Respond to box 1566. Smoke on the first floor multiple dwellings. There 
are considerations of Kathy Acker, the Met, unfinished books, cities and 
airports, codework, epistemology and punctuation. This is literally a 
must-read for anyone interested in globality and its incursions. 10130, 
459 Maple. I have to clear this up.

The Collected Poems of Kenneth Patchen, New Directions, 1968. I am 
revisiting Patchen after all these years and Orange Bears and the poems 
and other pieces are even more wonderful than I remember. Post 11. Stand 
by for the next dispatch. You got a 757 with the K-9 Unit, Harry. Are you 
all right over there? Right now I'm with the Chief Unit 100. Themes, 
Miriam and love, Christ walking around and talking just like you or me, 
are repeated, there are flowers and killings, and the intensity is 
amazing. I found a long article on Patchen by Henry Miller; it's on the 
Web if you search for it. Two male blacks with a black coats, fled toward 
White Avenue on foot. Near Franklin and Bedford. 75 Victor at 1077 New 
York Avenue. "I have but a bullet left / and there are so many things to 
kill." I'm home again. Track fire on the David line, Coney-Island bound, 
near Utrecht Avenue. Have a victim, cardiac, Franklin Avenue, seizure.

"Do you have a badge around your neck, like a real cop? That means you 
pay." - This interrupting. 10-4.

Yuan Dao: Tracing Dao to Its Source, translated by D.C. Lau and Roger T. 
Ames, Ballantine, 1998. Ames' introduction is brilliant. Which car, 
Sergeant? Box with plastic wrapping on it, next to a hydrant. Corner of 
President and Utica. This is an extremely important Taoist text, related 
to Daodejing and Zhuangzi, stressing triggering, water symbolism, 
accommodation, and the "Gerundical Dao." The text is short but requires a 
great deal of time to absorb. Its style is equal to the others, although 
it was written late second-century bce. Dispatchers on the 539, 739. I got 
a 39. The text seems to me to be unique in its stressing of ecological 
considerations; by virtue of the Dao, nature-ing. Oddly reminds one of 
Marcus Aurelius. Open door on Henry. 

Windows XP Annoyances For Geeks, David A. Karp, O'Reilly, 2004. This is an 
update of a book already reviewed - but this is an entirely new work, 
covering SP2 among other things. This may well be the best book available 
on tuning. Injured skater up on Community. Have them come to door #6 on 
the side of the building. Church fire. Broken down pickup truck. Recommend 
an ATA for a 36. There is a lot here for geeks as well - VBS scripting for 
automation, hardware troubleshooting, etc. Like the other O'Reilly books, 
it's detailed in terms of how things work. 71 call for help. The book is 
expensive, $34.95, but well worth it.

It's extremely cold out. The dispatcher _sieves, distributes, filters._
Redundancy's kept to a minimum. I find myself distracted by this internet 
of the real, these vectors laid and relayed across the square mile that 
constitutes my neighborhood. In the midst of a sentence, incoming; I'll 
move it to the end.

Mind Hacks, Tips & Tools for Using Your Brain, Tom Stafford & Matt Webb, 
O'Reilly 2005. By all means get this book, which is an absolutely unique 
description of the working of the mind - in practical, hacking, terms, 
with numerous Web references. Calls for help in Bushwick. The picture that 
emerges is that of a dynamic brain which doesn't map or model digitally; 
instead, it's a complex dialectic of frequencies, internal and external 
stimuli, locations and transmuted locations, retinal and other imminent 
learnings, etc. An accident by Bergen and Chancellor, possible 908. Don't 
know if anyone was hurt. Private house with smoke. Negative, anonymous 
caller who hung up. The hacks, by the way, are useful; I've incorporated 
some of the ideas into virtual modeling. If I were teaching new media, 
this is one of the books I'd use. All units stand by. 315. 315. Drifting 
of snow is expected. Snow will begin to fall at twelve-hundred hours. Plan 
A and Plan B emergencies. 

Drama Contemporary, Germany, edited by Carl Weber, Johns Hopkins, 1996. 
This has plays by Strauss, Tabori, Seidel, Pohl, Dorst, Jelinek, and 
Muller. I particularly love the Muller and the Jelinek (who just won the 
Nobel Prize for literature). Alpha zero three one six zero five five six 
six nine two. The Jelinek was a revelation, amazing, related to Heidegger 
and Arendt; after reading it, I read The Piano Teacher and Women as Lovers 
and will eventually order the rest of her work. It is torrid, dry, Duras, 
Beckett, Kraus, and amazing; the intensity drives it like Gillian Welch, 
inescapable. All of the plays here are brilliant, believe it or not; I've 
been missing out. 104 Montgomery Street, Washington and Franklin. 
Jelinek's is Totenauberg (Death/Valley/Summit); Muller's is Mommsen's 
Block; Tabori's is Mein Kampf.

A Theory of Fun for Game Design, Raph Koster, Paraglyph, 2005. What can I 
say? This is exactly it. I don't have any units available for this job. 
Supposed to be a private house. One item. Dispute. Call for help Greene 
Avenue. This book reminds me of the late Wittgenstein, deceptively simple, 
concerned with the habitus of game-play, expectation suites (my term), 
player/human concerns within and without the game-world, and so forth. 
I'll be using this for my own virtual work this summer; I recommend it as 
a way of clarifying intent, structure, and phenomenology of one's work. 
There is text only on the left-hand page, illustration on the right, but 
the cost is relatively cheap at $23. Armed man. "Even if players can see 
through fiction, the art of the game includes that fiction."

Islam in the Digital Age: E-Jihad, Online Fatwas and Cyber Islamic 
Environments, Gary R. Bunt, Pluto, Critical Studies on Islam, 2003. The 
kids live in the same building. Be advised. I will be reviewing this 
elsewhere, and am reading it now; I wanted to mention it as a guide - 
including a huge listing of websites - to online Islam. The book is oddly 
careful and "nervous," perhaps for obvious reasons. A wide-range of 
Islamic practices are described. Robber, first floor. The numbers for that 
search. I think detailed work, along these lines, is necessary on all 
fronts - it takes loose ideological cartels as beginning-points, and 
examines practices within them - instead of, for example, beginning with 
the "blog-structure" and proceeding out of it. Different forms of jihad 
are described, including inner, greater, and lesser. There are sections on 
9-11, Islamic diversity, Sunni Religious Authority, and so forth. 34 in
progress, male black choked. Missing female black, 11 years old, Charisma 
D. wearing red shirt, cloak, coat, hat, and blue jeans, last seen this 
morning. Please notify, anxious. 

White Volkswagen, check conditions if you will. And check out Razorsmile 
#3 - I always love this magazine, this one features chaos magick/tarot - 
go to http://homepage.ntlworld.com/matt.lee7/razorsmile. Good writing by 
Matt and Morrigan, whom (who?) some of you may know. Accompanying cd-rom. 
Habitual runaway. Second floor.

Figure Skating for Dummies, Kristi Yamaguchi, IDG, 1997. This is one of 
the best guides ever to the sport; I could well have used this during the 
Tonya Harding / Nancy Kerrigan debacle. For all sorts of reasons, I'm 
fascinated by Figure Skating; this is the best guide I've seen. Lighten up 
Frank. Don't call me Frank. Figure Skating is the "knot" between sports 
and the social, and the "knot" among issues of gender, muscle, creativity, 
restraint, intelligence. It plays out among all of them; in a sense, every 
event is an essay. 1403 New York Avenue. 1085. That unit. 

The Aryan Christ, The Secret Life of Carl Jung, Richard Nol, Random House, 
1977. I'm fascinated by this work on Jung's spiritual interests and 
associations. Corrected address 3025 Ocean Avenue. 169. 64 Woodhaven 
Westbound. Thin build, 5' 4", 130 pounds, she has brown hair, brown eyes, 
wears glasses, 13 years old. I've always found Jung both fascinating and 
problematic, veering towards the Aryan imaginary; this book goes a way in 
explanation. I've read this "out of context," not "being" a Jungian, so I 
have no other critical guidance than my own sparse understanding. But I do 
recommend this, if only for the sources - for that matter, I tend to 
believe in its findings. I've got him out on the -. Oklahoma plates.

Godey's Lady's Book, 1866, edited by Sarah Hale. Godey's was the most 
popular 19th-century woman's magazine in the United States; it ran from 
the early part of the century until 1898. Sarah Hale, an early and 
problematic feminist, edit it for most of its life. 12827. The 
illustrations are found ripped out and framed in numerous antique shops; 
on the other hand, if you can find a full issue, purchase it; the reading 
is excellent and one might learn more about 19th-century daily life from 
it, than any other source. There are stories, book reviews, poetry, all of 
interest. Mobilization point is the gas station on Auburn Street. She's 
was wearing red and black sneakers. Should I pick up my dog yet. 
(Something tells me I've already reviewed this and a few others - but I 
can't find the reviews anywhere. In my mind, then, perhaps, or perhaps you 
know better.)

Prayer Book for Sabbath and Festivals, Translated and Annotated with an 
Introduction by Philip Birnbaum, Hebrew Publishing Company, New York, 
1950. I've wanted to write on the Siddur for a while now, and this seems 
like an excellent standard edition. You need to respond to the second 
floor. Information is available upon request. There are notes and 
alternative readings. The Siddur is the heart of Orthodox daily practice; 
like all religious texts, there are ideological embeddings, subtexts, etc. 
I hope to do at least a partial deconstructive reading of the work. In 
general - with any number of religions - prayers are rarely analyzed; even 
with Shinto, while the Norita have been translated, actual practice and 
texts are rarely described. (I'm sure there are technical journals with 
such information, but it's not readily available.)

Jeans, red hat, red coat. The Collected Verse of Lewis Carroll, Macmillan, 
1933. Includes illustrations. I understand Deleuze's fascination. The work 
is not only beautiful; it's almost literally indescribable. What seems 
simple really isn't - He used to live in the building, doesn't live there 
any more, hangs around there. Michael Maldenado, hispanic, mustache, 
short hair, they call him Sparko, walk down Bergen Street. That was a big 
word there, I got you. 10-4 Good Night. There are issues of capital, 
technology, reworked nature, all at play; even nonsense is self-critiqued; 
the pieces reference each other; oddly enough, the children are hardly 
present. Charley's requesting a sergeant. Then there are the erotics of 
his photography; check out Alison Smith, editor, Exposed: The Victorian 
Nude, Watson-Guptill, New York.

It continues to be difficult to focus. TD involved in an MDA. There are 
sirens outside the window uncorrelated with the scanner background sirens. 
311 fire location. I think I'm letting you down, that these reviews aren't 
up to the usual, that centripetal daily life interferes, exhales. Every 
apartment is a lockdown. Bush spreads freedom while our jail population, 
mainly "minority," is well over two million. Spread the jails around the 
world - more money for corporate usa. 111 Police Boulevard. Confirmed 
fifteen-year-old habitual runaway.

To be reviewed: Phyllis Chesler, The new Anti-Semitism: The Current Crisis 
and What We Must Do About It; Tony Northrup and Eric Faulkner, Home 
Hacking Projects for Geeks; Frances Crosby, Poems of a Blind Girl. He's 
not answering. 37 George. Disregard, disregard. Disregard that. Family 
dispute. 3214 Beverly Road. 10-4. Altercation. Automatic alarm at the 
mall. Ex-boyfriend fighting there, destroying the house, 2143, code 3.

CONTROL SITES 


HONEY: "No giving and no speaking. He wandered about in the meadow; I 
pulled him up short. He could peer down my dress! He foreswore sex, but he 
couldn't help looking. Wrything tends towards argument, aggression, 
pathos, empathy, flaming, desire, net sex of labor which molds it. And an 
eight-year-old breaker boy in the anthracite mines is far less innocent 
than an eight-year-old breaking in to alt.sex.bondage gifs. The man 
thinks, she is the hole of philosophy. He has invested time against her 
space. She will construct her sex, she thinks. He is in time. I too refuse 
to die, the only linkage between the two of us, refuse, as, uh, the 
writing shoves itself out between my legs, one sex, uh, one hole or 
another and swollen holes, penises, aureoles, vaginas, asses, complexions, 
finger-nails, cuticles, hair, breasts held perfectly in place, nipples 
always erect. America produces erections; sex love of viagra-chemical 
love. taking viagra, a singular and misshapen element or entity. the 
signature of our sex: typical; other than liquidity, a sign of the dreams 
to come, there was the uncanny. The body floods into control sites, 
partial determinations. The control sites hold it at the origin. One can 
recite one's day in either medium, but the nuances are obviously absent.  
It's double penetration, like the double-coding of language itself. It's 
not fucking, though. It can't be grasped. It isn't sex. It's isn't 
anything. It's an arrangement, between myself and the avatar, the ends of 
the earth, I want to fuck your wives and daughters, steal your money, 
throw you out in the street, garbage! garbage! Straight, I see how THEY 
pervert the idea of sex, Christ, and affairs we are not allowed to shut 
the doors of our offices if there is a student of any degree of opposition 
sex within. the halls of the department of art are filled with television 
cameras and Sex ooh: ooh: ooh: ooh: ooh: ooh: ooh: ooh: ooh: ooh: ooh:

foundation -we're hurtling 80 miles an hour, exposed -5 theoretical turns 
-the body of sex, sexual body -writing or imagining the body of the

TRAVIS: "Pushing language to the reader so the body appears to be at 
stake: Think of writing orgasm in net-sex ooh: ooh: ooH when writing 
becomes sound or substance o much as turn from me. My gun will speak 
Eternity. You dream of me, blame it on me. Your sex is me, my gun you'll 
see. I'm only here to beg, obey. The gun makes, our sex will be our arms 
and legs and minds. We'll pull our dresses up. We'll smell of the 
corporate state: slaves and slavers, violated and violaters, the 
over-populated world. Human-species bloom into impure substance, rubs sex 
raw against north-american-european."

You can have me, have my love."

Codework Self-Negated


If not for self-negation, codework remains within formal structures, 
broken, chaotic, or otherwise. It's semantics that opens up the universe 
of discourse; at the same time, semantics shuts down or bypasses the 
structures. The problematization of language rises by itself as 
symbolically or indexically generated; the ikonic fades, varies from 
workstation to workstation. The work of the viewer lies not in the 
decipherment of the structure, but within the assemblage of insistent 
content through and in spite of the structure. Anything else resonates 
with already tried and tired conceptualist attitudes, where teleology 
tended towards perfection, and the horizon was a closed set of usually 
well-defined, often countable, elements. In every case, energy and habitus 
are required for creation, sustaining, transmission; this is necessarily a 
substructural contamination that forms illicit ties with the semantics, 
feeds into it. Not a closed universe of discourse, then, but a holarchic 
sememe or neural structuring that opens elsewhere with axons tending the 
real, i.e. the stewardship of the real. Thus codework becomes a model of 
universal political economy, complete with filtering, censorship, 
distribution, equivalencies, duplications - but also cries, wars, fucks, 
furies, talks sought and talks returned.

Second to the extent that meaning is always already a construct, neither 
scaffold nor sememic tissue are construed from transcendence, i.e., agency 
is necessary for the completion of a circuit which may or may not occur. 
Agency always produces circuitry. The habitus creates decipherment in any 
case, formal or informal, skeletal or meat-driven. So it is a question of 
history and the history of agency. The self-negation of codework occurs 
within this history and this agency. The self-negation is an aesthetic 
drive occasioned by the work, largely subconscious. The decipherment 
results in a hardening of meaning, just as a riddle is hardened by its 
solution. Of codework there is no solution. Of cries, wars, fucks, furies, 
talks sought and talks returned, there is no solution.

There is no solution of meaning, nothing to be wagered, at stake, nothing 
granted. Meaning stumbles through the code of the codework, meaning is the 
vegetable of the mineral code, the production of the animal in the twenty 
questions of the riddle. Animal, vegetable, mineral, all are contaminated 
by agency. Agency does not resolve. Self-negation is parasitic, the 
construct of unrepentant, unresolved agency. The content is the chaotic 
mix. Structure sits at the bar, content the blood-stain on the floor. The 
crime of codework: meaning oozes. It needs the hydraulics of the code. It 
is of the code, attaches itself to the sememe. Contamination of the 
sememe: the sememe. The content and meaning of codework is contamination. 
The riddle is resonant. Unresolved contamination cries, fucks, furies, 
talks, expends, empties.

Asher and Sarah

The monomaniac may act normal under most circumstance. Once, however, his 
theme is triggered, an overflow results, and the theme dominates, until it 
has expended itself. This potentially repetitive cycle is his only sign of 
disturbance, since otherwise he is of the company of men in every way. 
Treatment is almost always unnecessary, unless the theme is suicide or 
murder, or some other harmful efflorescence, in which case it must be 
dealt with, as soon as possible.

The woman was of high degree and charity; she was loved by a clerk and a 
knight. The knight won the woman and her fair blond hair; the knight 
kissed her taut breasts the color of roses. The knight lay within her 
night and day; she became a leper and was cast out. The clerk took her in 
and covered her with kisses; at first she resisted and always begged for 
death. Eventually she died and the clerk kept her corpse; even now he 
kisses the rotting flesh six months after her demise.

Everyone reads the bible, but do you have to read the whole thing? One can 
get the picture almost immediately, and the rest of the time it's up to 
the leader of the congregation. In her dreams she heard the question asked 
repeatedly, do we have to read the whole thing, do we have to read the 
whole thing? It seemed humorous. Although fearful of crowds and travel, 
she became an analyst herself, and patients came for treatment in her 
rooms at the hotel.

"the lyric poem

"If Auschwitz hadn't happened, if September were another,
"I'd say that you were mine, I'd say we'd stay together,
"In any darkness, weather; if Beirut were filled with flowers, 
"Jerusalem a town, I'd say we'd live forever, I'd say we'd be together;
"If Afghanistan were peaceful, if America were other,
"I'd say we're made for one another, I'd say eternity;
"If Rwanda never happened, Sudan were prosperous,
"I'd say we'd love forever, I'd say a god was there, so glorious in us;
"If Israel were milk, and Palestine of honey, and China were so sweet,
"We'd lie together there, I'd say you were the rose, 
"All among the fairest; if one voice hadn't happened, 
"Another took its place, I'd say your name forever, 
"And we would live forever; if September were another, 
"A day of bright fall weather, if Auschwitz hadn't happened,
"In any darkness, weather, I'd say that we were peaceful,
"I'd say eternity, if animals still roamed free, if there were animals,
"I'd say a god was there, so glorious in us, all among the fairest;
"If one voice hadn't happened, another took its place."

for kenneth patchen

when christ spoke on the mount
the winds were terrible
people couldn't see 'im
quite a distance, they said, later
quite a distance
and the winds and the clouds
the storms, too, the weather was furious
so they wrote what they thought they heard
and spoke what they thought they saw
and chances were pretty good
that he wasn't there at all

of the book what we once were where now is hair
http://www.asondheim.org/peopleofthebook.jpg
of the book what we once were where now are shoes
 Deutsche Welle broadcast this evening, schoolchildren
hair, shoes, glasses, books, eyes
eyes, hair, shoes, glasses, books
 but I don't want this, I want the things in the room
 I want the programs, of the book we will be
 daily the book changes, it is a book of days, of hours
 first and last book of seconds, microseconds
the clumsy icons really make nothing 
pixel riding, to them it's all one and the same
to us, too, reading between the lines, between zero and one
 nothing's there

# We're done so far.


Research: Reviewing Bunt's Islam in the Digital Age, and following links 
and links. There is rhetoric that stands out; some is reproduced below in 
dialog, without attribution; all writing is wryting in this space.

Oddly, what emerges is bliss, that not only are words open to other words, 
but the performativity of speech is, perhaps, already a therapeutic; in 
the midst of cries, there are moments of silence. 

Without hope, there is abject depression, decathexis; with decathexis, 
defuge, the breath stops and stops itself. O comfort of the barren 
grounds! One pulls back from the gate; Arbeit never macht frei.

 
# We're done so far.

Please keep in mind: Only a living bug is a good bug. Bugs are perfect, 
they allways do their jobs.

Dear Nazi Pigs and Muslim cowards, We want to thank you. Because your hate 
created us and made us stronger. With every swas sticker you draw, and 
head you cut off, we become more ferocious. While you meet in mosques and 
march on Skokie, we were being tested in battle. So look left, look right, 
were dark skinned too, or blond and blue eyed just like you, trained by 
the best and here amongst you. See you at the meetings, were watching you.

Think about it - don't be just another whore. Thanks. "Removed by C@ndi 
with an eye" is apparently all that remains of what was the message board 
forum formerly known as "ITS HAPPENNING." IH was an attempt to bring 
together diverse parties from around the world to exchange opposing views 
and share information. Unfortunately not all the dialog was friendly and 
intended in the spirit of universal awareness.... as such, some have taken 
it upon themselves to delete, corrupt, and and render unusable that which 
was the IH board. IH was a purely not for profit operation and the cost 
and stress of operations far exceeded any donations made toward 
maintenance or upgrading as such there, will be NO rebuild. Those who gave 
the most were those that gave their time for free for the thankless job of 
trying to moderate an unmoderated board. This was in itself an almost 
undefinable task, but those, and you know who you are, that did this, rose 
to the occasion. To all of the posters who have made IH their home, we set 
you free now, as this really is the end of the road for "ItsHappening" it 
was fun while it lasted. Goodbye.

Explaining the second concept in the design he said it involves taking the 
pedestrians from the source, not letting them accumulate into a huge crowd 
that you cannot deal with like what we got now Jamaraat area, he said.
[...] The third concept is to make the stoning process much easier than 
what it is nowadays by changing the shape of the Jamaraat from round to 
ellipse, so that the crowd can be divided into various groups from various 
directions. That will make the flow go through much easier, and the pebble 
throwing process very fast and safe, for the people. A simulation model 
has been designed specially for these, and Jamaraat will be given optimum 
width and optimum length. The Jamaraat will be changed from a column to a 
very wide wall so that it can be clearly visible and comfortable for the 
pilgrims to throw their pebbles.

No wonder why Hitler wanted tocook all u Ann Franks..... All u dirty jews 
are rich or in hollywood wut do u have to bitch about? the Holocaust? My 
Lutheran Grandpa died for u  ungreateful slobs..... Your website is trash 
all of yer kind needs to be sent to Aushwitz

Question: What is the ruling regarding washing the stones for stoning (the 
Jamaraat)? Response: They should not be washed. Rather, if a person washes 
them with the intention of worshipping Allaah (by this action), then this 
is an innovation because the Prophet (sal-Allaahu `alayhe wa sallam) did 
not do this.

On 10th Thul-Hijjah I along with my elder son went to Jamaraat for Ramee.  
When we were at a distance of 10 meter from the Jamrah, we had to pull out 
without Ramee; and on return both of us were hit by a speedy motorcyclist 
- we fell down - sustained minor injuries - police helped and we came back 
to our camp at Muzdalifah.  In the evening I and my elder son went again 
and stoned the Jamrah Aqbah (the Big one) on our behalf and on behalf of 
my wife and the younger fat son.

This summarily had me banned from the forum. I am not that terribly upset 
about being banned. However, it does highlight the type of muddle-headed, 
biased, blind support of terror that has all but guaranteed the 
re-election of George W. Bush. Most Americans do not support terrorism. 
Yet the left is going out of its way to coddle terrorists, even inviting 
terrorist and terrorist apologist under the Democratic tent.

O believers, do not expect your enemies to end with the land of Iraq, they 
shall try to take over the lands of Syria and Egypt and Arabia and Iran  
if they could not put their agents onto power, as they did in the Gulf 
lands, they shall never accept that the Muslims have a strong state.

You can go anywhere or NOwhere

Nothing is worth our children dying for unless there is a maniac or (sic) 
the loose.

Ultimately, our goal is The Supreme Existance, the Muslims call that Allah 
(litterally The God), the Followers of Jesus(A) call Him God, the 
Followers of Moses(A) call him YHWA, the Followers of other Prophets have 
used other names, the bottom line is the goal is one and same - the 
Supreme Existance and Creator Sustainer of the Universes.

Then Abu Abd Allah (al- Sadiq), peace be on him, said: 'Brother of the 
people of Egypt, you think that the time forces them (the sun and the 
moon, day and night) to come successively, then why does the time not 
force them to come back? And if the time was able to force them to come 
back, why does it not take them away?

Allah is the light of the heavens and the earth; His light is as a niche 
in which is a lamp, and the lamp is in a glass, the glass is as though it 
were a glittering star; it is lit from a blessed tree, an Olive neither of 
east nor of the west, the oil of which would well-nigh give light though 
no fire touched it, Light upon Light, Allah guides to His light whom He 
pleases; and Allah strikes out parables for men; and Allah all things doth 
know.

This is why The Pink Swastika, a comprehensive study of homoeroticism in 
Germany by Scott Lively & Kent Abrams is considered high heresy in America 
while still occupying a place on the reference shelves at Yad Vashem. 
Lively & Abrams confirm that Nazism was a movement born of the homoerotic 
German subculture of macho homosexuals, people who fostered a violent, 
anti-Semitic, and pederast-enshrining mindset, as opposed to Germany's 
"femmes," the docile subculture representing perhaps 10% of German 
homosexuals who condemned pedophilia, were less likely to harbor 
anti-Semitic proclivities, and may claim legitimately that some of them 
were German homosexuals hypocritically persecuted by the Nazis - by macho 
homosexuals.

Due to the israel judaism barbarism against your people and to your noble 
figth against it is why i decided to write you, it was a litle hard to 
find your page, but finally i did; this writing means to congratulate you 
and show my admirations and support on your work, because i share the same 
feelings against jewish people, because even i have read the protocols of 
zion i had the conviction of what jewish mean, my people is also tramped 
by them, and i am not sure if my country shares my feelings about you, 
cause most of them are mediatized, and influenced by the united states 
culture, but not all of us have the eyes covered, some of us relize of 
what is going on in the world, so once again want to express my support 
and admiration from México, and even there exists a great distance between 
your country, your culture and your language there exists a link that 
unite us as brothers and makes us feel the need to be together and share 
the joy and suffering and support each other.

((Umar ibn AbdulAzeez used to gather the fuqahaa. every night and they 
would (all) remember death, the Day of Judgment and the Hereafter and then 
they would weep)

O people! When a person meditates upon the histories of past nations and 
populations, he will be instantly amazed at the revolutions and 
transformations they went through. For instance, there was a pioneering 
nation (i.e., the Muslim nation) which led the world for many centuries 
but then, it faltered and lost its leading role; it fell in the midst of 
blind imitation and followed the paths of other nations in terms of 
manners and beliefs. Once it was at the acme of development and reached 
the highest level of power and glory, but it later fell to the lowest 
point and was afflicted with misery. It died after it had been living, 
deteriorated after it was once flourishing and withered after it was 
blossoming. It was the nation that discovered the sources of knowledge and 
developed the Islaamic civilization and sciences, which the West later 
obtained significantly, without having to exert the least of efforts. Thus 
it seems as if the gates towards progress had been shut off for the 
Muslims as they turned into artificial consumers of the Western 
civilization. They even began to adopt certain features of it, which were 
originally theirs but had been stolen away from them.

O Muslims! When a Muslim blindly imitates the West, he turns into a loyal 
supporter of their beliefs and customs; he is like one who tries to reform 
something but spoils it while he is unaware. He is just like a defeated 
follower, like a baby who bites and severs his mother's breast while it is 
in his mouth. Such a person does not know that blind copying of the West 
involves hidden hazards and that our rights, honor and dignity are 
violated by such imitation and imbecilic pride

Our real time intelligence is deployed worldwide for contingency 
capability, executive decision making and strategic threat assessment.

John Donne, The Computation

For the first twenty years, since yesterday
*/ I had my WinCE but yet I could not play - /*
 I scarce believed, thou couldst be gone away,
 */ And yet the Hat of Red wormed in the fray. /*
For forty more, I fed on favours past,
*/ My linux box I knew was always fast - /*
 And forty on hopes, that thou wouldst, they might last.
 */ But Amiga left bereft and my hopes cast /*
Tears drowned one hundred, and sighs blew out two,
*/ And lost ran towards BSD, the kernel new. /*
 A thousand I did neither think, nor do
 */ Of Unix flavours, those I most did rue - /*
 Or not divide, all being one thought of you;
 */ Including Darwin riding hard and true - /*
 Or in a thousand more, forgot that too.
 */ Gave up to WinXP the universal glue. /*
Yet call not this long life; but think that I
*/ Resolve to run OS in universal sky - /*
Am, by being dead, immortal; can ghosts die?
*/ Until the dead return, and on machines rely. /*
