archaea6.exe at http://www.asondheim.org/portal/archaea6.exe



you must click on the image

this seems to run on PCs with WinXP 

i'm not sure what happens with Win98

i tried on Win95 and had to load up so many files it crashed

i reloaded Win95 and it ran faster than ever but not the archaea

i think it might be where vb6 runs and where it does not

the mathematics is complex but not untoward in terms of functions

the program should be allowed to play out

that's why there are no mouseoverunderclicks to cancel

you can resize before but perhaps it would run more awkwardly

archaea6.exe is a lovely arbor and a curtain drawing down

the curtain d. d. is called dusk / closure or perhaps closure / dusk

it is both a time of day and a dedication to romanticist denouement

it is important that the archaea series contains no random function

it is all true calculation of the machine

this is my philosophy in the series which is a philosophy as well

numerous crown coral fungi*

heron and egret



here in kingston, a great blue heron has injured its left foot; it appears 

broken.



we went to the fire station.

we called wnep-tv which covers wildlife.

we called the audubon society in harrisburg, 150 miles away; there is no 

local audubon society.

we called a local emergency animal clinic.

we called a nearby animal hospital.

we called the pennsylvania game and wildlife commission.



we spoke to people and left messages. there is a chance the bird will 

be rescued.



just before, a great white egret, majestic. this bird has also come north. 

it was skittish, but flew gracefully.



images of both, documenting the faunal arrivals.

near the ending of this series these lines transform

a landscape through its furrowing and destiny



of course it might continue forever

but already variation is not what archaea is about

each a slight differentiation from the other



the other is already slighted with difference

they come together near a destiny

Statement on asondheim.org/portal/*.exe for Lewis LaCook





The programs are operating in the space between analog and digital,

although totally grounded in the digital. How much can mathesis transform

semantics? All of them except for bee.exe are determined and therefore the

metaphorical application of the machinic to the world.



The code is simply vb-wise and somewhat complex in terms of nesting and

recursion. I tend to work well with trignometric functions, which near the

limits, say, of tangent and cotangent, can resonate with the limits of the

computation itself.



Furthermore these images are interpreted in terms of the underlying

photographs - a lichen-like growth upon them, empathetic and cohering.

In turn, they modify, deconstruct.



What are they deconstructing? Language, meaning, symbols, the symbolic.

Through erasure and the growth of form.

phenomenology of the numb(n).exe, of some others



http://www.asondheim.org/portal/ *.exe



the programs devour the (x,y) coordinates returning and inputting the 

color values Point(x,y). the image reconstitutes itself. 



circle coordinates Circle (x,y), radius, Point(x,y), , , elliptical 

distortion - may be < or > the ScaleHeight and ScaleWidth. beyond the 

image, an infinite exterior of black (0,0,0) or white (255,255,255). 



in this manner the _exterior_ interrupts the _interior,_ constructing the 

_binary_.



procedures and routines are neither interior or exterior; they configure 

the world of the image, leaving a residue. they take residence elsewhere. 



the resulting _flux_ of the image is the result of devouring. think of the 

image as fractionated - internals and externals.



devouring occurs in digital waves across the limits. the tangential 

escapes; the sign-sine operates from normalization, scanning Width and 

Height. 



what is exterior is never recorded; it is left to the _imagination_.



what is interior is fully recorded; it is interpreted by the _fancy_.



the semantics are always in dialog, as semantics always are. the image: 

what of it? easily readable. its transformation is a _diacritical_ mark, 

the image lingering in memory. 



one goes _numb_ with the numbers across the body, the medical model, 

prisoner model, social model, socio-economic model. the _skein_ of the 

stationary body. 



or the fractionation of the x-nor or not-x-nor logical inversions of the 

pen-writing _degree ground zero_ of contradiction, unspeaking, mute. and 

the superposition or projection of the mute.



'nowadays, the earth is not only fragile, it is becoming increasingly 

_transparent_. one sees through it or beyond it, there's no end to it, 

this sight.'
