Parable of the Dead Emperor


"I travel my path as it leads through what is in accord with nature until
I fall by the wayside and find rest, breathing my last into that air form
which day by day I draw breath, while my body falls to join the earth from
which my father received the seed, my mother the blood, my nurse the milk
which were mine, that earth from which day by day for so many years I have
been fed and watered as I stepped upon it, and which I have made use of
for so many things."

Daishin Nikuko, quoting Marcus Aurelius, Grube translation. For what Dai-
shin Nikuko cannot do, can be done for her, by slave and emperor alike; 
what is done for her does encourage her to forgo distinction. What is done
for her is the act of taking letters from one language, sprinkling them in
kanji or letters in another, and what is done, in the deeper sense and
sentencing of such letters, is the act of thought itself. For Daishin
Nikuko does not expect to drink at the well of all thought, or rather,
perhaps to drink at such a body of water, but hardly to fill it with her
piss or breast milk, not with so many tributaries and dessications plum-
meting the earth into certain extinction.

"To drink my piss," says Daishin Nikuko, is to achieve the greatest orgasm
you could ever imagine, and this will cost you two dollars. What is two
dollars in distinction to the eternal? What is the eternal in contradis-
tinction to me?
