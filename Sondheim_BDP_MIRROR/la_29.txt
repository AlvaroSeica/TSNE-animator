   flecked with blood, brown spots, this interior
   i will be on the surface of such as is the great disk
   transparent, i will see you cross the interior
   you will be upon the surface, you will see me cross
   flecked with blood, brown spots, an interior
   i will be beneath you, you will be beneath me
   between us, an interior, flecked and spotted
   we will look down between us, look up between us
   legs, legs, legs
   mouths, mouths, mouths
   
   ( of the disk, it will say nothing
   ( of the disk, nothing will be said
