From sondheim Tue Mar  4 00:50:46 1997
I love you Jennifer! I think that I own your cunt! You own the hole
that is me! You splay my legs, reach in for my poor milk! I am undone!
I dream of your labia at night. I think you're taking over me. If any-
one reads this message, they will know the truth. All my love, Alan,
verging on psychosis, desperate to separate from herself.
