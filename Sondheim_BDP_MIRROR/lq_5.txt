[trad] knowledge of which makes or performs knowledge


crawled through the gnawed jaw of the glen, jennifer spotted the milk-
white toothed polypore wrapped around the edged trunk crashed hard into
the forest floor; before long white cheese polypore were showing up ev-
erywhere. consider this: dusk, moss, water, ice, winter polypore survival,
breathing hard heterologically. carbon balls and cushions covered the
edges of things, every and all other asunder.

Crying of Wolf


Nikuko cried wolf when she yammered about being dismembered. Alan cried
wolf when he cried and scratched himself over deep depression. Jennifer
cried wolf over virginity and Julu cried wolf over Nikuko. Nikuko cried
wolf over murder and mayhem. Alan and Jennifer cried wolf over the spil-
ling of blood. Over and over again, the quartet cried wolf over rape and 
wound, death and annihilation, destruction and castration, the cutting- 
off of limbs, scraping-out of eyes, tearing-off of ears and tongues.

Nothing happened to the quartet as they cried wolf over and over again.
Then one day ...

If you're leaving, leave! Don't be so narish, okay? Zol zein azoy! It's my

fighting space

so far on one cdrom, edited, re-edited w/sorenson compression, mp3, etc.:
40 minutes music
500 images (gif, jpeg, bmp)
40-50 small programs
18 video pieces totaling about an hour
5000 pages print
5-6 flash pieces (collaborations all; i can't work flash myself)
2 websuites
40 articles
my own website which includes the pages print above as well as:
 dhtml and javascript work
 2 vrml pieces

still 25 megabytes left. you go from original video thru belkin to avi 
and from that to sorenson quicktime at 33%, audio kept 16 bit but 11k
at the top which does a good job getting rid of hiss.

original video shooting on hi8 and dv, edited on premier and soundforge.  
html stuff on dream weaver, hand type, netscape, corel. still images on
everything from alchemy through 2 photoshops, psp, display, corel, gimp,
about 25 other programs. polypore images direct from nikon 800. program
images originally run in qbasic. texts made in pico, as well as 3 ascii
editors from thailand, emacs, dos editor, and dana, among others. text
programs from display, perl, ti59 programming (years ago), and the various
small apps in /usr/games for linux/unix. music with moog, shakuhachi, wes-
tern flute, electric guitar, mirage; the guitar feeds through an effects
box to a small marshall amp which simulates tube design.

work stems anywhere from early 70s (pascal programming) through the most
recent double residency at the experimental television center, which pro-
duce most of the recent videos. cameras used were sony hi 8s and dvs, as
well as numerous smaller cameras, including some panasonics and quick-cams
- about 13 cameras in all. the residency was with foofwa d'imobilite and
azure carter; we produced about 100 images, 20 videos, couple of hours of
audio;  there are several parables of nikuko videos on the cdrom, as well
as seals, a new piece, and pieces dealing with swaying and just about
falling. the videos resonate with each other, with the texts, with the 
still images, with some of the music/soundwork. oh i can move among spaces 
and places here forever. oh for the amazed contents of a disk, and who 
cares about production value when intense content bursts through anything, 
asserts itself in the corner of a screen, looms large in one's dreams. 

25 megabytes left, the rest of my/our lives ...

me on, pushing into me, driving your car write over me, screaming into my

brief note

from Nikuko - "I can drive the voices out of my head temporarily by asking
them to shut up, be quiet; sometimes this leads to more and more chatter
as one objection after another is offered. It's exhausting. Sometimes
there's a break of a few seconds, though, during which I regain strength,
inhabit silence, rest. I almost beg them. I'll whisper to them, as if that
would make any difference. They go on about all sorts of things. They in-
sist they have nowhere else to talk. Usually it's about trivia - things to
do, events of the day, the latest gossip, revenge scenarios. I've tried to
take more control - I really have. If I start singing, one or another of
them takes over, and that's no help. I wonder who's making the requests;
I desperately need sleep, not these incessant voices ..."

Hysteria


I aim myself towards the sun. I open myself towards the sun.
I splash and vomit the sun. When I am towards the sun, I am
wayward. When the sun is towards me, I am Jennifer.

I loan my frock to Julu, that is why I am called wayward.
When Julu borrows my frock, I am Jennifer.
When I am called, I am called wayward little girl.
When I call, I am Jennifer.

Devour wanton frock wayward Jennifer.
I aim myself towards the sun. I open myself towards the sun.
I splash and vomit the sun.
When I am towards the sun, I am wayward. 
When the sun is towards me, I am Jennifer.

Beyond the nervous, is hard, nervous.
Beyond the wayward is Jennifer wayward.

The Understudy


    Curtain rises.
    
    She enters, bows.

    She is exhausted. She recites:

Interference Theory of Dis-ease


    The curtain rises.

    She walks to the front of the stage

    She bows. She begins to speak.

There is no girl in my life. I watch you carefully. I learn from you. At
night I'm sleepless. I want to focus on theory. I want to write philoso-
phy. Instead, the sheets are trampled beneath me. I wake sweating with
uneasy dreams. Without theory I am lost. Without you, I am more than lost;
your limbs break my hypothesis. I am obsessive-compulsive. I follow you
everywhere, I inhale you. Your scent surrounds me. I dream of your cast-
off clothing. 

    She bows. She speaks again.

The boys tease me; I don't pay attention. They're not in my dreams. I am
writing an essay; I am writing about ontology, about epistemology - I am
talking to you. What is there to understand? I use the metaphor of eating
- I want to devour you, devour everything about you. Wanting is like brea-
thing; to want is to be wanton, think of nothing but you. It interferes,
this metaphor - your body outlined in the window-light. I can't speak
well, this emotion has surrounded me.

    She bows. She speaks again.

Breathing is a kind of focusing. My nakedness is a gift; I write, always,
naked. Ontology collapses in waves against the body; sight pries open the
darkest secrets. This is the job of the philosopher and the lover; there
is no differance. You duplicate yourself repeatedly; you are everywhere,
shuddering within the fragile domains of objects, outlined against stones,
trees, cars, radios, men and women. Are fantasies theories, theories fan-
tasies? Are we knowing? Are we better people?

    She bows. She speaks again.

I want to devour, want wanton, to devour more than ever, inhale flesh and
cloth, hair and necklace, nail and effluvia, eyes and thinking that makes
us human, against all techne, against all odds. It is my obsequious priv-
ilege, my humiliation, to devour. You show yourself to me; that is, you
walk in newer clothes. I show myself to you, naked and broken, written by
theory, writing you, writing theory.

    She bows. She speaks again.

I am afraid of nothing I devour. I am fearful of theory, of my dreams of
theory, of my theory of dreams, of your dreams. Thank you for listening.

    She bows.

    The curtain falls.

Calligraphic


Calligraphy fascinates because it conjures the impossible coupling of the
machine / incision / inscription - as if the world were divine (Foucauld-
ian divinatio) with style leaving space for thought otherwise. I am refer- 
encing Chinese or Japanese calligraphy - not pictogrammatic, but gesture 
which infiltrates the line and its endings in various pathways. It is the 
space or gap which reveals both the inertness of the world and the place- 
ment of writing as breathing, not harboring ontology or name the things of 
creation, but slowing their undoing. You might see affect in the layering 
of symbols, always, as if it impossible to speak without the body in mind, 
as if all creations are inequal, languorous and dependent upon their emo- 
tional originations. This is not the concrete poetry of the calligraphic; 
it is not the renaissance emblem or shaped poetics or signature. Instead, 
one might look to the writing as the slow movement of the earths absolving 
all denumerations, definitions, taxonomies - or the earths' quickness in 
asserting themselves through the releasing of signs into the earth, stone, 
metal, air, water, fire ... the ideogrammar of non-being, ideogrammar of 
this world's last creation ...

And this my own twisted stroke through all of it - the running writing,
grass writing, clerical, seal, etc. Or perhaps not the seal with, so oft-
en, its unnerving rectilinearity, already speaking confinement of the rim,
the contract. Certainly through the varying width of strokes otherwise.

In Seals (cdrom video), Azure and I demarcate each other's bodies, sealing
them with hanko stone and ink; our bodies tangle; the kanji are worn out,
worn through; exhausted, we're framed by the sealing processes; the ins-
criptions of the world disappearing into the flesh; in a certain silence
or background sound; you can watch in any order; there is also the clear
evidence of desire, erection going nowhere, seals just above penis and
vagina, the k/not of the writings - and presence or absence of the vacated
space of non-being, as if this were the next-to-last ...

Clearing a space, unnaming, all within the absenting of the frame as well, 
computer screen, software application screen, uncanny inertness of windows 
appearing and disappearing, inscription denying itself, an accumulation of 
protocols and languages tending towards their metaphoric dissolution ...

Fu Shan: "With painstaking care, he used a centered brush tip to make
strong, rounded strokes in imitation of the even, unmodulated lines in an-
cient bronze inscriptions. He also undermined the readability of the sutra
by littering it with strange characters. A religious text is seemingly
transformed into a magical charm by an unreadably archaic script further
confused by invented characters." (The Aesthetics of the Unusual and the
Strange in Seventeenth-Century Calligraphy, by Dora C. Y. Ching, in Harr-
ist and Fong, The Embodied Image: Chinese Calligraphy from the John B.
Elliott Collection.)

All machines of all languages and all words and all symbols and all subs-
trates and all texts and all utterances and all pauses and all sounds and
all worlds and all things and all non-things and all breaths and all mach-
ines ...

"And to dramative matters, Butor is an old friend of Klossowksi, and Klo- 
ssowski says: 'my syntax is Roberte's skin.' _My syntax,_ and not the sup- 
port for my writing or its eventual printing. And _Roberte's skin_ is the 
skin enclosing the volume of a discrete body carrying a proper name. Now 
isn't what Klossowski expresses here perversion? The hardness, the tension
of grammar and glossary operate like the production of a screen stretched 
to the breaking point. This screen closes upon itself into a voluminous 
body - the body of Roberte - amd this body can be connected to a subject 
who will inhabit its interior. Thus any fixed variation of grammar, of 
glossary will produce a sign, a shiver, a passing of intensity upon the 
body proper of the victim." (False Flights in Literature, Jean-Francois 
Lyotard, in Toward the Post-Modern, ed. Harvey and Roberts.) 

One might call forth the brush against the computer screen, stretched to
the breaking point across a skin wearing its display, immobilized, punc-
tured, hung. All machines and all languages and all protocols and all and 
so forth and all ... ... 

"Can there be speech, poetry, and thought beyond the letter, beyond the 
death of the voice and the death of language?" (Pascoli and the Thought of 
the Voice, Giorgio Agamben, The End of the Poem, Studies in Poetics.)

The imaginary of the sliding body within an inconceivability of the tech- 
nological (all technology is inconceivable), since, as for the calligraph- 
ic, it fastens itself (calligraphic ideogrammar)

"It is therefore not truly a matter of phono-symbolism, but rather a mat-
ter of a sphere so to speak beyond or before sound, a sphere that does not 
_symbolize_ anything as much as it simply _indicates_ an intention to sig- 
nify, that is, the voice in its originary purity." (ibid.)

The calligraphic fastens itself only in order to release; nothing gnaws
the end of the stroke or its delimitation, enumeration, against the radi-
cals which presuppose ruined and incoherent taxonomies. The stroke is the
weakest emission, however lending itself to techne, the rigorous ordering
of the remains of the world. In Seals, after the stroke of the hanko
against the rigorous skin, a drop of lubricant* appears at the tip of the
penis, as if the body might then, after all is said and written, continue
its slide elsewhere.

Calligraphic Legacy Applications and the Scrawl


unreadable calligraphic, the scrawl - one might think of the edgy brunt of
the symbol, borders unprotected, conjectural spaces. what occurs to read-
ing, paralleling outmoded tech - decades from now, cdroms will be as thick
- unable to be decoded. from the analog to the digital, decoding becomes
increasingly difficult. think of wire recording - this is readable at any
speed - the double difficulty lies only in direction and speed. with mul-
ti-tracking, an additional element - that of settlement of desired sounds
- how many might play control-track background in the distant future? but
all of this is relatively simple; helical-scan video - even scan-line vid-
eo already plays calligraphic havoc. with digital, the problem is close to
insurmountable - there are codes upon codes based on specific programs and
protocols; there is the requirement of highly-sophisticated machinery -
think of a 19th-century music-box cylinder without any other instructions
- without knowing the scale employed or even the means of sound production
- you're getting the idea. but the obtuse calligraphic itself is dependent
upon the knowledge that, not only is the substrate readable, but the fault
- if such it be - lies in the complex negotiation between writer and read- 
er - always already mediated. here again the unnerving, uncanny, unaccoun- 
table, is raised - as if the text has been cast loose from its overly fam- 
iliar mooring. think of xu bing or fu shan in this connection ...

think - nikuko in dead alan, look for nikuko, you'll find her, whirled and
troubles brewing. then there's that nikuko, julu, nikuko, nothing comes
but foam and tendon. she soothes my eyes.

i sit on the chair naked, nikuko sits on me, she says, i want to show nik-

nikuko sits partly clothed on the couch, her doctor leopold konninger in a

and nikuko the doctor leopold konninger sit on the couch - the source of
parables, she said, is the comprehending of worlds; space is gone space,

nikuko brings signs to humans, by nikuko lying naked in the arms of doctor
leopold konninger, if nikuko said she were your thing and this was her ko-
nninger offering you nikuko would you fill her secrets and if julu burned
the house and town, would you be careful, between one hard breath and
another. you'd be watching jennifer watching alan watching nikuko. you
couldn't do anything in the portal. you couldn't recognize the portal. you
couldn't recognize the sign.

whirl your legs, nikuko; whirl them taut, whirled your legs, nikuko; whirl
them in a very nikuko dancing for konninger nikuko whirls. nikuko whirls
and enthralls me. nikuko: dance your stupid dance, i'll come out of the
cave, grab you, and here's the stage and nikuko looks so beautiful, about

calligraphic iii (the riddle)


calligraphic ideogrammar doesn't move, carries the dynamic within the
page, tendrils beneath the surface, holding the fastness of the ink, styl-
us cuneiform tending towards the impress of musculature upon the substrate
of clay, one follows the muscles in both, incisions, pronouncements, only
in writing can everything find embodiment - that is its primary, many into
one, in this instance even the proper name a universal, reading bodies in
the shimmerings, coalescence to unity, holding their own (obsessive-com-
pulsive neurosis of the name) - this primary as in, four arms of the mas-
culine body, as in - enshrouding mist, music and chant, sound and glad
tidings, sonorous quoting or citing, concealed and seal, addiction and
habitual craving, in the depth of the night, pornographic and luxurious,
loose and idle, feminine principle or moon, the shade of a tree north of a
hill or south of a river, the negative ion, private parts of a woman -
pressure of seal against the flesh of a screen, page of a body, screen of
a page - the speech of the writing crawling across the surface of a stone,
the cut of the crawl or double-stroke of the crawl, impress of the flow,
the residue of musculature, memory of the sign, sign of the memory - move-
ment of ideogrammar, movement of calligraphic - uncarrying dynamic beyond
the page, tendrils gone from the surface, ink spilling out

(2001 Course description for SVA graduate MFA department in computer)


Internet Culture and Community

This course is designed to give students a broad overview of the past,
present, and future Internet, including its history, sociology, and
anthropology. We will focus on the development of online communities -
their ideologies, software structures, and demographics. Newsgroups,
chats, email lists, MUDs, MOOs, and text-based, graphic or 3-d meeting
spaces will be considered. We will also look at the construction of 
the "online subject" or user, and deal with issues such as "Internet
addiction," Net relationships and sexuality, and Net art/culture in
general. We'll pay attention to the ethos of hacking, the open software
source movement, and the Net from an international standpoint. This 
course is useful for understanding the Net in depth; it has practical
application as well for anyone working on on-line sites.
