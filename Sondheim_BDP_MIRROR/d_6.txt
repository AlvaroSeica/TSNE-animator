Questions, Malaise





Why are we reading these lists?

Do we hope to accomplish anything here?

Do we really feel this is a form of community?

Why are the demographics currently so skewed to males?

Why is there such a rapid turnover on the lists?

Are we too sensitive or not enough to one another?

Why have all the cyber-romances disappeared?

Are we discovering a viral anguish in our midst?



I'm reading the list to learn and belong. I'm tired of anti-intellectual-

ism. I hope to learn from reasoned debate. I want to feel I belong. I am

ashamed there are so few women participating. I wish that the community

would develop and not lose membership so often. I feel we need more sens-

itivity at times. I hope for the perfect cyber-lover and her appearance

forever in my life. I feel we are all anguished more than we admit. 



This is a list that needs more knowledge. This is a place where people who

think would find a home. This is a place where flame-wars should give way

to careful replies. This is a place of belonging and taking responsibility

for one's language. This is a place which should be everyone's. This is a

place where we should know our rites of passage. This is a place of repri-

mands and comforting. This is a place of bodies and ghosts. 



Academics and nonacademics, intellectuals, and cypherpunks, women and men,

mothers and fathers, students and teachers, unemployed and workers, be-

lievers and non-believers, empowerment and release, patients and doctors. 



Take these spaces with you, spread the word, scroll the real, or not...
