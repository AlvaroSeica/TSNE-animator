I admire people who can read logs clearly, and understand all the file
types. Really, there are so many of them, that an amateur can hardly keep
track. Some, such as .ht, I recognize as a hypertelnet configuration file,
but things like .idx leave me totally confused. And what is it about these
particular files that makes them so resistive? I'm fascinated with
ocgen.log.

I showed these files to M****. He's more of a neophyte than I am, which
made me feel better. But still, when I've fragmented before, everything
has gone through the mill. And this time, look what happens! - even though
I've taken pains to close down all sorts of background processes.

Here's part of the ocgen.log:

[accessutil - OC_WIZARD_CREATED] - complete
[commapps - OC_WIZARD_CREATED] - complete
[multim - OC_WIZARD_CREATED] - complete
[accessopt - OC_WIZARD_CREATED] - complete
[pinball - OC_WIZARD_CREATED] - complete
[mswordpad - OC_WIZARD_CREATED] - complete
[wbem - OC_QUERY_STATE] - complete

Here's my favorite part:

[autoupdate - OC_ABOUT_TO_COMMIT_QUEUE] - complete
[rootautoupdate - OC_ABOUT_TO_COMMIT_QUEUE] - complete
[ieaccess - OC_ABOUT_TO_COMMIT_QUEUE] - complete
[games - OC_ABOUT_TO_COMMIT_QUEUE] - complete
[accessutil - OC_ABOUT_TO_COMMIT_QUEUE] - complete
[commapps - OC_ABOUT_TO_COMMIT_QUEUE] - complete
[multim - OC_ABOUT_TO_COMMIT_QUEUE] - complete
[accessopt - OC_ABOUT_TO_COMMIT_QUEUE] - complete

About to commit what? Perhaps to be committed, set-aside? The terrifying
thing here is the fragmentation - what happened, what happened - why am I
so curious - what strange beast slouches towards us - what horsemen, fury,
apocalypse - metal fragment straight-jacket torn in 17 pieces - something
moving in pieces - in the distance -

wonderful because to be sure everythi ng I do has been of miserable cause, 
that is to say, far more difficult than I w ould like; programming is not 
my strong point, and you can't even run spellcheck  t^?   when there are 
many deliberate errors. Now that I am freed, I will take my plac e among 
the poets, I will have a history, you will be the witness to that histor
