There appears to be some writing on the note ...
Is this whatever truth there is?
Because I wonder what the biz is.
Or if the biz is biz.
And who are you to gain the plane
Which has taken off (your clothes)
Leaving you plain and in pain
And nothing left you suppose
To your brain but a stain
When there is nothing to gain
Here hexed by text
Nothing more before
Nothing left to store

Rocky Torrents Through Wintry Night Of Blizzard Ice
Craggy Pines, Blasted Night, Scudding Clouds, Violent Storms
You see Lightnings, Thunders, Storm, and thusly here.
I see no "Rocky Torrents" here.

Statement on asondheim.org/portal/*.exe for Lewis LaCook


The programs are operating in the space between analog and digital,
although totally grounded in the digital. How much can mathesis transform
semantics? All of them except for bee.exe are determined and therefore the
metaphorical application of the machinic to the world.

The code is simply vb-wise and somewhat complex in terms of nesting and
recursion. I tend to work well with trignometric functions, which near the
limits, say, of tangent and cotangent, can resonate with the limits of the
computation itself.

Furthermore these images are interpreted in terms of the underlying
photographs - a lichen-like growth upon them, empathetic and cohering.
In turn, they modify, deconstruct.

What are they deconstructing? Language, meaning, symbols, the symbolic.
Through erasure and the growth of form.

phenomenology of the numb(n).exe, of some others

http://www.asondheim.org/portal/ *.exe

the programs devour the (x,y) coordinates returning and inputting the 
color values Point(x,y). the image reconstitutes itself. 

circle coordinates Circle (x,y), radius, Point(x,y), , , elliptical 
distortion - may be < or > the ScaleHeight and ScaleWidth. beyond the 
image, an infinite exterior of black (0,0,0) or white (255,255,255). 

in this manner the _exterior_ interrupts the _interior,_ constructing the 
_binary_.

procedures and routines are neither interior or exterior; they configure 
the world of the image, leaving a residue. they take residence elsewhere. 

the resulting _flux_ of the image is the result of devouring. think of the 
image as fractionated - internals and externals.

devouring occurs in digital waves across the limits. the tangential 
escapes; the sign-sine operates from normalization, scanning Width and 
Height. 

what is exterior is never recorded; it is left to the _imagination_.

what is interior is fully recorded; it is interpreted by the _fancy_.

the semantics are always in dialog, as semantics always are. the image: 
what of it? easily readable. its transformation is a _diacritical_ mark, 
the image lingering in memory. 

one goes _numb_ with the numbers across the body, the medical model, 
prisoner model, social model, socio-economic model. the _skein_ of the 
stationary body. 

or the fractionation of the x-nor or not-x-nor logical inversions of the 
pen-writing _degree ground zero_ of contradiction, unspeaking, mute. and 
the superposition or projection of the mute.

'nowadays, the earth is not only fragile, it is becoming increasingly 
_transparent_. one sees through it or beyond it, there's no end to it, 
this sight.'
