Roots ii

Roots are lines of flight are tendrils, narrowing down, are rhizomes, 
what Koestler called holarchic, but the thinning into microtubules belies
the origins of consciousness in memory tightening its noose on the self; 
if you can't think, it's nostalgia that has blocked the way with perman- 
ency. The root flees from the plant; it's idiotic to think otherwise; 
tethered to an invisible sun, it seeks the darkness of nourishment and 
moisture, forgetting the presence of seeds and reproduction.

The root untethers, exposes lines of flight, rhizomes, for concatenations 
- chains collapsing near their weakest links, joined by the purely con- 
tingent, tangential to one another. The process of meristomation extends 
the cells towards whatever stimulus or trope makes its apparent appear- 
ance; what expands has already lost the semblance of a source. Caught, 
cauterized, blind, hold up on these objects.

Ghosts pervade the movement of molecular dirts, trammeled dusts thwarted 
in the presence of new life, residue of a trace or inscription; writing 
founds itself everywhere. Writing is a rooting of the socius from the 
outside, the outset; it returns transforming into itself, the implicate 
order of dirt, flight, line, rhizome, memory turned through circularity 
into a chaotic mix incapable of resolution. The sporadic instances of 
ghosting efface or frame resolution, filtering; ghosts traps disappear 
upon the onslaught of China, only to reappear once again and forever in 
the midst of missile fields, other lines of flight...
