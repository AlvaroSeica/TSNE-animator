Shell Interface

The shell has a number of advantages over the graphic user interfaces, in
spite of the fact that the latter support sound/images:

1 Almost always faster than ppp or slip connections
2 Many more options for every application
3 A HUGE number of commands unavailable elsewhere: traceroute, rusers,
rev, whois, etc.
4 Extremely sophisticated file manipulation tools
5 On-line storage for files
6 Extremely fast ability to leap between applications
7 Ability to _work_ a lot more mail options
8 A _homespace_ which foregrounds all other operations
9 Secure chat such as ytalk
10 Access to all the telnet ports
11 Nothing beats yet the Unix news readers which turn newsgroups into
easily accessible content, _news_
12 Total ability to configure your own account; I run memo programs here,
for example, that I wrote myself - and they reside on Panix, using Perl
13 With traceroute etc. the ability to really test the health/waters of
the Net
14 An interface that is coherent and easier to understand (I know this
from teaching)
15 Coherent and extensive help is available through man or apropos
commands
16 Runs on _every_ computer I've seen through straightforward communi-
cations software.
