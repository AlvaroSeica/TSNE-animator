Farming and Community





This is the wave of the future; we need a general import for the sine wave 

to function, operating with the Origin in the upper left, lower right, 

operating with the Origin in the center of the page, third or pineal Eye.



We need something. We need a new vocabulary to bring body and intellect

forward. We need to establish homes. What about irrigation. We need law-

courts with a formation of justice that takes into account the suppleness

of new modalities of communication. We need no control. We need adminis-

tration to keep the substructure operational, the drainage ditches beneath

the fields. We need the elimination of blockage, compliance with county

and regional laws. The tiles must be evenly proportioned and caulked; the

effluvia must drain into the sediment ponds for further processing, just

like the Model Farm in Far Hills, New Jersey. 



The croplands support a variety of life, wild and domestic, on the sur- 

face. Thin wires connect everyone through star-clusters, each home and 

person-home a site of perfect illumination.



The soil is rich with dark loam, a smell of musk, the secret stirrings of

routes and tendrils, translucent foams twist slowly in the dark monarchy

of brown slitherings; nothing stirs above. Tunnels evince sentience,

fumble with obscure openings, close cloacae behind them, tumble on. 



We need the moaning soil and its transparencies of heat, the dark encrus- 

tations, silvered filaments of cyberspace, webs haunted by swollen drop- 

lets of swift mucous. We need paths of escape, swift and poisonous ef- 

fluvia, black streams rupturing the last coherent glimmerings of the mind.
