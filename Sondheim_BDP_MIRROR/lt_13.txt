lift the grooves,
lift the grooves from the surface of the rock
balls in grooves & if you slant the rock they roll dependent 
let ones move from groove to groove
lift the grooves,
lift the grooves from the surface of the rock
later on it will remain for all time: let ones remain, 
from groove to groove, let us lift, let us lift the grooves
later on, the grooves worn, balls flailing against all accountancy,
let us lift the grooves from the surface of the rock
later on, museums of grooves, a few remaining balls, weakened, witness,
against all accountancy,
lift the grooves from the surface of the rock, museums of balls,
museums of markers and tokens, museums of bullae and tallies,
let us lift, let us lift the grooves,
against all accountancy,
let us lift the grooves,
let us lift the grooves from the surface of the rock
