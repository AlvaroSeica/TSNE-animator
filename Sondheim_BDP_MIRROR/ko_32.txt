Hey, A Black!, E White, I('m) Read! YAY!, U(ni)Verse (Green), Oh so Blue:
Hey, vowels, Just one of these Days I'm Gonna speak to your New Words!
So what? Hey, A Black Corset, Neat Large and Rotund Nipples Every Day
(Sorry, Wrong Line), Well, just covered with big old Sparkle-Flies!
Bombing and lots of Cruel Smells, O You can Imagine and Now

There's Shadowy Gulfs of E, all vapors and something called "tentes" and
Lots of Candor Here! Then there's glacial and fiery spears and something
else, wait, White Kings yes shaking something called "Ombelles" Without
the Capital, I's pretty lipping after and bloody perky Visage! wouldn't
You Say I? In anger, or the usual drunken Penitents? And where'd this
Extra Line "Come in"?

U(ni)Cycles Divine and terrific Vibrations in Viridian Seas!, this is U!
Peaceful animals all around something and peace of Taking Rides that
Alchemy impresses everyone on the grand and studious fronts, maybe
"Foreheads" wouldn't U think if U could? Grand and Very Serious Sages
just for You and they Know all these Words too!

Now this big terrific Clairion Trumpets, full of strange Stridencies Made
of O, you know, dOn't you? I'm Jennifer giving you This Terrific Trance-
lation! Silences just rush around Worlds, Angels, Avatars, and even Julu
Comes in for O Nikuk-O! Heh! O's just the very end of it, Omega's his Name
and You'll Never guess his Game, it's the Violet Ray of his I's (way out
of Order, _here!_).

And if there were still An other A-Vowel in my Native French, it would go
Here, aw, Go on Jennifer, Y not? The pun laps Big Seas of Marble! And How
Do I know! I'm Arthur Rimbaud!
