*you: Who is this you, who has been this you? For example: "its appearance 
on your screen": What of possession, of a habitus falsely taken for gran- 
ted? Where is the tourist here? Why must _one_ take this or that into 
account? Why is this, why has this been or not been, (a, the) philosophy 
at all? Again - there are so many holes - "Even if this were in an older 
print medium": How is a text _in_ a book? In a page? On a page? Is a book 
a print medium? Does a book have any relevance here? If this were in an 
older print medium: What is the "this" that, seemingly, has been freely 
and effortlessly transported? Is such transport possible? (Someone weeps: 
I'm not guilty, it's not my font...)
