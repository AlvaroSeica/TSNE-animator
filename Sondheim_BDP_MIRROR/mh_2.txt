cancer

returning again to a writing space, blank screen, words messaged across
2000 kilometers. an occasion of cancers; it is surrounding us, killing our
friends and relatives, killing people we have known, many of them young.
suddenly, there are triple narratives coming in, triple stories of diagno-
ses, radiations, internal organs, contusions, exhausted on the brink of
death's seduction. the human condition always reduces to the same old
tired situation of wisdom come too late; the elderly are wise but organic-
ally weakened, and it is the stuff of young muscle, hormones, and force
that dominates the world. give the lie to this among elderly generals,
heads of states, murderers all. but young and broken we are with the heat
of revolt and the slaughter of innocents, and old and catastrophic we
become, sliding into inchoate silence and isolation, comprehending the
world, with no one to listen, less reason for speech. now cancer takes
away whole universes on the edge of understanding; messiahs are elderly,
silenced with truth bubbling from their tongues. everything is confused as
wealth buys power at any age. i am still, even now, surprised that it
cannot buy health, that slaughter takes rich and poor alike, that diseases
of long suffering cannot be siphoned off by technologies of the upper
classes. the world is increasingly lesioned; those who have cancer are in
the vanguard of devastation. it is our failure as a species that we have
not the time to grow wise, but only the time to kill, only the time to 
die.

of the dream of jennifer and alan


in this dream i am talking with my father who is very old and dying and
living alone in that big house he lives in now with my mother gone and i
 was looking through his books and in this dream the books were almost
 ruined, moldy, and he looked so very close to death and i pulled out
  my baby book, which was common then as i am common, and it was falling
  apart, all those anecdotes and weights around birth, the lock of air,
  the footprint on the page, and it was ruined, the cover half-gone, the
  binding falling apart as my life was and i began crying in my sleep and
  said to my father, everything has been falling apart since mother died

bass museum new media panel 1/21/02: i do


{large on window 1:}

the LOST project created for the trAce online writing group:: people wrote 
about things they lost and never found again:: the descriptions were put 
up online in a list:: the writers' names were also put up, separated from 
their descriptions::

in order to enter the description, you had to write through what appeared 
to be a Web-page on the verge of collapse...

{window 2: the lost project at http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/lost/}

{window 3: Life .mov: text-quicktime of year-by-year bio truncated at 74
letters}

{large on window 4:}

my work's concerned with language, sexuality, the virtual body and 
subjectivity - all of these elements interacting online and off - 

i'm concerned with what happens beneath the surface, the coding, the 
psychoanalytics, the substances

i'm concerned, i'm very concerned

{window 5: Seals .mov: azure and i writing/rewriting each other's bodies}

{in window 4 i write:}

Seals the signs are early Chinese ideograms for breathing, circulating, 
soul, the sign just above the genitals is negation, still in use today:
working through a form of deconstruction

{in window 1 i continue to write:}

people lose their identities here. the screen jiggles as if broken. their 
names are separated from the descriptions of their lost belongings

{in window 4 i continue to write:}

i work with broken things, code as if it wouldn't work, bodies as if 
they're falling apart, text that has bones in it coming to the surface 

{texts in window 1 and window 4 mix}

{i close all windows except for window 5}

{i enlarge window 5: blurred image of azure and i turning our bodies 
together: the signs are rubbing off, rubbing off}

{i close window 5}

enormous organisms, ephemeral, copper-wire, fiber-optic, satellites: 
antennas all
the organisms are invisible but they respond to the coherency of network
communications
they sense intelligence running through the wires, they are themselves
intelligent, they are among us
what to do, they think, what to do, what to do
they bumble, banging into packets and datagrams, they don't understand
digital protocols and programs
it's as if they're amputated, as if they're blinded, in the middle of
human artifacts, human designs
they're sentient, they can't read the codes, they have so much to tell us,
they're silenced by zeros and ones
they don't understand the vast landscape of binaries, they have no feeling
for addresses, they murmur softly to one another
their understanding is beyond our comprehension, their knowledge
unsurpassed, our coding is our own, their coding is their own
the wires are humming, as if carrying sensibility multiplexing beyond our
wildest imaginations
organisms of such intelligence, bridge the great divide, please, we beg
you, come to us come to us

by virtue of the indent, language becomes stuff
 it sits there, gnawing at the margin, as if something else were going
 on. it continues in this fashion - there was a pressure applied, a
 sliding effect 
  no such thing exists in any form whatsoever. someone thinks: it's a
  conscious choice, the words were put there, they were arranged in
  such-and-such a fashion
  in reality it could be anything at all. but it gnaws, slips, slides
  forward, just about to topple, this substance of language, this
  phonemics which sticks in the throat,
   the most vulnerable part of the body. there is no stopping speech, nor
   syntax, once language moves from protolanguage, protosyntax, to this
   incipient point,
   then back again, as now. a conjuration 'in print' of language's
   foreignness, its other of any other. as if we're faced of a sudden,
   faced of a night, with this determinative
   (indicated by a push
   (indicating by a toppling, or what appears to be an arrangement
    perhaps a contract made by someone or something)
    perhaps the very nature of a contract itself)

iBedee radio: This is the same as Mountain Time. You are listening
Mountain Time.
iBudi radio: This is Eastern Time. This is the last radio. You are

The last radio: Hello. Now we will play you a tune. Once there was a

You see #1. You see i#1. {i#1}^2=#1. This is a sonnet of apocalypse.
This is your imaginary. State the Galois group of the imaginary.
The Body rising up, the Body rising up. This is Western time. This is

Now we will play you the Silver Bullet Overture. Do come in and end.
