When I'm In Love





When I'm in love I gotta write better than ever before because I wanna be

with the woman I love and want her to know in all that I do how much I

love her too. When I'm in love I gotta write so well that my words fill the

earth the air the ocean, the wires gotta sing and the birds gotta cheep. 



When I'm in love her beauty smile comes and visits in my dreams and my

eyes travel the world in search of that certain smile, I gotta see that

certain smile. 



When I'm in love I lie all twisted with her body curled up with nothing 

but glass and that smile between us. When I'm in love I wanna touch that 

body wanna touch that body wanna be that body wanna be that body's touch.



When I'm in love the fish gotta sing and the birds gotta fly, the dogs 

gotta howl and the cats gotta cry. When I'm in love I gotta wanna be 

with you, when I'm in love I'm naked and new. When I'm in love I wanna be 

with you, when you're in love, I wanna see you naked too.
