In INDIANA it was recently VOTED that ALL RAILROAD TRAINS and ALL
TELEPHONE POLES and SOME BUILDINGS will be PLACED ON THEIR SIDES
permanently. Thus the TRAINS have their WHEELS by convention on 
THEIR RIGHT-HAND-SIDE, against thin RAILS held VERTICALLY into
PLACE. Furthermore, SMALL CARRIAGES POSSESSING WHEELS are permit-
ted BENEATH THE SIDEWAYS CARS AND ENGINES to enable them to MOVE
ABOUT THE LANDSCAPE in SUCH A CONDITION.

THE SAME does NOT hold true for ALL BUILDINGS but SOME BUILDINGS,
which, on their SIDE, may have BOTH WINDOWS AND DOORS OPENING IN-
TO THE EARTH BELOW, as well as OTHER WINDOWS AND DOORS OPENING
ONTO THE SKY ABOVE, as well as STILL OTHER WINDOWS AND DOORS OP-
EN ON TWO SIDES for EASY EGRESS AND EXIT, as well as ENTRANCE.

As for the TELEPHONE POLES, ALL OF WHICH are ON THEIR SIDES, 
there should be PLACED UPON THEM, WARNINGS FOR CHLDREN, AGAINST
the TOUCHING of such wires AS THEY NOW CARRY, EASILY LAID UPON
THE EARTH.

Outtages MAY OCCUR.
