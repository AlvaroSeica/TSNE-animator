there'd be other kinds of pleasure, so simply tied to fulfillment or 
closing off the leaks. But now I'm elaborating a response to this... let's

Agree with keeping the focus. The locus of the above is sexuality, the way 
it plays out on say SVU or with Janet Jackson's breast, etc. It's a 
puritanism consistently pushed to the breaking-point. But the discussion 
leads elsewhere, to pop culture, communality, not the isolation, the 
_body_ in the hospital bed or on the battlefield... (Alan)
