Internal Diaspora


When I was in Montreal, I read a magazine called Exile, I worked on writ-
ing and video interpenetrating anglophone Toronto, francophone Quebec,
bodies, flows, surfaces - the tapes were shown in both regions. My teeth
chattered from the differance. Here in Sydney, I find myself still condi-
tioned by internal diaspora, the disaffection of settlement, the flight
from existence in relation to roots which crumble at approach. From
childhood on, I have been effectively displaced, returning to sites of
disavowal, originating within just another family drama. 

So consulting, I emphasize both community and total access, the communica-
tion among neighbors with limited means perhaps, dreaming myself of an
inexhaustible richness in friendships and institutions where I never felt
at home. If home is where the heart is, it travels with me, childhood and
other traumas tailored neatly into adult vectors of policy. I can only
wonder again whether I see the world clearly, if at all, whether the in-
itself in fact comprises the realm of simulacra as well. 

And whether this tawdry biography is not at the originary locus of theor- 
etical position and desire...

If anideological thrust possessed serrated edges, I would find nonetheless
_slippage_ at my sight/site; through the cracks, returning to memorization
and _passing._ Jerzy Kosinski remains a dark mentor. He did not, could 
not, acknowledge the _day._
