(Another, this time fuzzier, summary of things, written originally for 
Empyre)

Hi, I'm writing in answer to Johannes' invitation, and will be somewhat 
short here. I've dealt with issues of sexuality, pain, death, and mourning 
in the virtual, and in the virtual in relation to the real. The points I'd 
make are as follows -

That we are always already virtual, that the symbolic and the super- 
structure of the symbolic (its uncanny appearance of closure), brings us 
elsewhere in our embodiment;

That abject pain and abjection as well (in Kristeva's sense) break through 
the symbolic, literally muddying the waters of the real;

That messiness is on the edge of virtual worlds and their (computational, 
virtual, formal) gamespace - and it's this edge which opens up the 
possibility of thinking through embodiment.

On a practical level, avatars can be anything in a sense; some performers 
use them as functions, so that embodiment occurs as abstracted extensions 
or structured articulations; some performers "see" them as extensions of 
themselves; in some cases, the extensions, as in Polyani's tacit 
knowledge, are inhering and smoothly incorporated within the body; and so 
forth. My own avatars are often so highly extended and abstracted, that 
they mediate between the body and the function; they serve as broken 
embodiments that veer, for the performer, between exchange value and usage 
(in Polyani's sense) value - between structure (objects and arrows) and 
kernel (internal circulations) for example.

Sexuality breaks through in so many ways - arousal brings "the body" 
around into resonance with itself, through any of the styles of embodiment 
and so what triggers what, and where, and how, and with what symbolic 
manifestations, becomes problematized and "smeared" across categories. I 
think this breaking through is also true of mourning and representations 
of death in the virtual, which cease to remain representations; in the 
virtual, death is embodied, repeatedly enacted and re-enacted. When I 
crash out of the MacGrid I receive a message "You have just committed 
suicide" - and to whom is this address; the statement itself is a form of 
differend in the real, incapable of being received.

It's the smearing that fascinates, and what happens in social media for 
example with bullying - where statements within the virtual, naming or not 
naming names, react upon the body of the bullied? Or another exanple - how 
does (for example) credit card hacking itself play with embodiment, if at 
all? Or ISIS using Twitter, apparently hijacking World Cup tags? I tend 
towards the messiness of Foucault's Archaeology of Knowledge, thinking in 
terms, not of separations and analysis (which also tend towards genre and 
canon), but of flows, spews, abjections, tolerances, potential wells and 
tunnelling, and so forth. In other words, perhaps, on the far side of the 
academic, where people live and die.

Thanks, hope this makes some sense; unlike "my" avatar in Second Life, 
Alan Dojoji, my sleeplessness last night ("I" have acute insomnia), has 
most likely led to a certain blurriness of reason -

yours, Alan

I'm finally playing at AS220 here in Providence, with Azure, 
as part of a bill with Henry Warwick, July 26. So here are some 
files working towards that, but of course taking on a life of 
their own. Azure sings; the instrumentation is tro sor, suroz,
and ukulele. I'm particularly fond of the tro sor pieces, which
are difficult, but all of them are interesting -

thanks to John Cayley 
(the Cave is a three-dimensional immersive
virtual environment.)

in the course of the day, dozens of images,
13 videos, and 6 audio files (combined into
1) were produced. 

cavefilm is a performance with emanations.
cavewaveb is a filtered recording of radio
emissions generated by the cave, from long-
wave at 162k through shortwave at 21mhz.
the stills are production stills. i'm quite
excited by this line of work in which 
interior and exterior are blurred, cave and
body entangle. the drum is a nepalese madal.

cavewave records the machinery at work, the 
intensity of radiations producing, through
interpretation, surface effect; cavefilm
translates surface effect into affect; it 
is all staging. is the body staged? i don't
know, but it solos!

My candle burns at both ends;
Wow, how do you hold it!
   It will not last the night;
I guess from the middle?!
But ah, my foes, and oh, my friends
Then you have to keep it horizontal!
   It gives a lovely light!
Wax goes everywhere!

My candle burns at both ends;
Yippee! We can see again!
   It will not last the night;
Two flames are better than one!
But ah, my foes, and oh, my friends
Aren't they?
   It gives a lovely light!
I guess I'm speaking out of turn!!

My candle burns at both ends;
Zowee! A party!
   It will not last the night;
My night's ninety years long!
But ah, my foes, and oh, my friends
How many times do we need to listen to Sting?
   It gives a lovely light!
Who's Sting?!!

My candle burns at both ends;
Watt's happening?! Try the new bulbs!!
   It will not last the night;
Things couldn't be better!
But ah, my foes, and oh, my friends
Sorry, things just got better!
   It gives a lovely light!
Things just got best of all!!!!!!!!!!!

The Alpine zither is a beautiful instrument; I found one again, 
this time with its full complement of 31 zither strings, plus
five for fingering. I'm surprised no one else is exploring
it - it's amazing. The raw file is above. I've also found a
modern piccolo (Selmer PC-300), and I've added a couple of
piccolo pieces as well. Then there are the three images of the
Alpine zither, in case you're not familiar. This one seems
quite old -
