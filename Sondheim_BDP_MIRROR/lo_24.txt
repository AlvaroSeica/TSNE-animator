The Collection of Papyri in the New Museum


We first come to the Collection of Papyri. To the left are two cases which
contain book and writing accessories, including an exercise-book of nine
wax tablets; to the right, a seated figure of Sebek-hotep with a book and
writing-case (fastened on the left breast). On the walls are Texts in the
Egyptian Language, the most noteworthy of which are from the Book of the
Dead; to the right of the entrance, 3008. Representation of the judgment
of the dead; on the right wall, Syrian, Coptic, and Arabic Texts. On the
parapet are Greek Texts: in the middle, 11,656. Tax-roll under Hadrian
(A.D. 133); 11,547. Decree of Germanicus (A.D. 19); 10,582. Latin-Greek-
Coptic conversational book; to the right are fragments of texts from Euri-
pides (13,217), Sophocles (9908), Aristophanes (13,231 c), from the 'Per-
sians' of Timotheus of Miletus (9875), important as being the oldest Greek
handwriting on papyrus (5th cent. B.C., still previous to the Ptolemaic
period), Alcaeus (9810), Sappho (9722), and the Iliad (6485 and 11,510).
