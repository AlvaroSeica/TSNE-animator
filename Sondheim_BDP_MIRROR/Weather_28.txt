Conference

We're going in and out of conference mode. Adriana Garriga has been work-
ing on setting up a #conference channel on IRC. We're also going to have a
presence as you know on PMC2. I may change my space to "conference" with
instructions in lieu of description, usable either to accommodate new-
comers to MOOS and/or send MOOers onto IRC with redirected instructions. 

There's no "good" way to do any of this, I think. There's no "good" way 
to represent Internet except for Internet. I haven't seen any truly 
successful exhibitions, for example - the interiority of the Net, what 
one _experiences_ on-line, is always missing. At the conference we're 
going to attempt to change text to sound, interactive - it's the _sound_ 
of the Net, in fact, a false or simulacrum-sound, that _speaks_ within 
one, since the Net, even Net text, is speech of sorts, if nothing more 
than Vygotsky's inner speech. 

(When you write to me, you speak to me. When you speak to me, you wryte 
me. The world is encompassed by inscription circumscribing the world; 
desire fissures the remainder which seeps into the w/hole. That is the 
way of the world.)

(What is parenthetical is always whispered, annotated, a measure of some-
thing _always meant to be._ An aside, it is taken for the armature of the
other. It's the aside that gives the play away, the demarcation of the
audience, re: Natyasastra.)
