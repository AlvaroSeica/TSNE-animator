flame and flower
this is the start of the flower of the text the beautiful flower
this is the start of something new, don't be terrified
flower and flame
constitute themselves with the very bdg/cesiveness of community - stead of
thkg of totalized cerent community, one might thk of strangled seedlgs, me
and me out of the maw of the keyboard, ground by the teeth of the keys,
tongue of the space bar, open to coursed symbolics, you're watchg a body
the process of livg, the process of heavg itself, the process, swollen
engged spew of letters, grateful slurry of pollen, encapsulations, discre-
tions, dust everywhere, do i ever do enough, of phrases, mountas of para-
graphs, flimsy wlds of texts, objects, f the crippled life-fms of my wk,
flame and flower
that was the start of the flower of the text the beautiful flower
that was the start of something new, don't be terrified
flower and flame
