Parable


"And now I will go back to the world of parable-writing..."

Nikuko writes this in a letter. How can the Pure-Nikuko-Land express
itself were it not for the presence of the brush and the ink and the
paper and the scroll? Not to mention the scroll-handles, scroll-box,
and gilt edges so necessary to set the words off from the rest of the
world.

Nikuko searches for the perfect story, the story with the lapse or
blank in the midst of it, occasion for fulfillment of spiritual void.
She searches newpaper and terebi-drama, searches anywhere, refuses the
parabola of parables of the past, trajectory of Aesop or Blue-Cliff.
What is a parable, if not a spiritual truth? What is the guise of the
story? What is the truth of the spirit? What is the truth?

What is the writing of parables?
