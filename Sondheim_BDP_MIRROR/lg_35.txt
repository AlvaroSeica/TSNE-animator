When I die I need you to create my philosophy.
Please do go and read all of the Internet Text before it is taken away.
It can be taken away at any moment and you must save it yourself.
Then when I die you can go back and love every word for its brilliance.
You can harbor words close to your body so you will finally understand me.
All my words connect through underground chambers very close to the truth.
The chambers form hieroglyphs of the mind and my philosophy.
You will find everything you need in these hieroglyphs of my philosophy.
You must take a great deal of time because thought does not come quickly.
Every moment you spend on my Internet Text will be repaid in full.
You will be utterly changed because you will have worked it out yourself.
All truths cannot be uttered by anyone except yourself.
I have opened the gate for you to understand this and other truths.
In my Internet Text you will discover if there are truths at all.
Perhaps you will discover if there are truths in any case.
My own needs will be met if you read and reread my text and understand.
To understand you must save the words and the order of the words.
My own needs are those of surviving through the words I have written.
No one will understand me fully for decades except through concentration.
Concentration and study are the keynotes to this success.
With all my heart I promise you this will all be worthwhile.
You will judge for yourself and realize the truth I have given you.
The philosophy is there within as the greatest gift of all.
Please be successful with my philosophy and save my very words.
This is a hope for tomorrow and I will never know if I am in your heart.
Thank you for preserving my Internet Text and studying its philosophy.
