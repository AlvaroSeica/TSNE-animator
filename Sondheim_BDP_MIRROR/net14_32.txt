Alias Alias Host





the shuddering of the pentagram of the backbone, slow churning of the

mbone, four components of the address, three periodicities of the

separation of components and subnet masquerades within the IP inner

pentangle, the eight bits of the bytes, seven bits of the bytes, the

shimmering between one and another, o high ascii rain your SMTP down

upon me, your seven men of technical prowess, your triple double-you,

WWW down upon me, your wize wychery wommyn down upon me, o unity of

TCP/IP, true cabbalistic purity of the GGP, _gilgal_ wheel protocol,

alias host, the duality of TCP/IP, the routing of the mailer-daemons:

as it is said _in unix everything is owned by someone,_ even the root

has its root, o come five great levels of the Law, the physical net

whereby the pentagram resides beneath the splintered vertebrae of the

root-bone itself, the internet meshing through datagrams carrying the

secret name of the user, the public name of the user, the real name

of the user, the magick-user transport protocol, the packets of herbs

and feathers, packets of bites and bones, swift streams and talk across

the exterior gateway routers, bridged to other dark domains, routing 

more dark daemon hordes: I pray to thee datagram, by all that is penta-

gram backbone holy, pray to thee soul-beam churned through the wires, 

fragmented into philtres devoured by gateways, echoed by links and 

queues: here is thy prayer: 



O churning of local-area-networks, O flickering of the eyelids of the

soul

Lost among packets and dark retransmissions by Daemons mounting attack

on each and every host

O raise the host on high, return lost packets in from tiny world of

ether, stream, and virtual connections



and the daemons routed return to the bridges of WAN, the meltdown un-

ravels the backbone itself, transparent gateways open to towering names

and _items named and syntax of names,_ and with the shuddering of the

pentagram of the backbone, language is born...



O routing, O ARP, O promiscuous ARP hacked back into the newborn's arms!
