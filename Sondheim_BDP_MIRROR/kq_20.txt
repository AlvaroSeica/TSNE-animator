says you know where this is going, the fevers, deliriums, nauseas, chills,
shiverings, caught in Los Angeles and in cyberspace, portal-sites of hal-
lucinations, these figures, sites, nodes, operating systems, flying past -
_most important of all_ - the Cursor or Prompt - at the edge of the screen
- teetering - what a field for waveform activity broken down by protocols,
pixels, bits and bytes - rough on the shoulders - burden to bear - Cursor
of all humankind - hallucinating the keyword - I'll move out of this space
- what's called the Key in special books - then you'll see me again, then
I'll see you again - it's the same old story - I can't see straight, think
straight - Cursor gnaws at my throat - opens up a hole into the chords -
the Prompt can't speak - Prompt can't say anything - Prompt says "where
are you" - Prompt says "the chills the chills" - Prompt begs you to enter
something - "there at the Prompt" - we're waiting to be taken to the Other
Women on the Other Side - "I know, I know" - fueled - close to passing out
- fever _and more_ -
