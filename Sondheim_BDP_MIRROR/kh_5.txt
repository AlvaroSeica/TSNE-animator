Parable


I, Daishin Nikuko, write this at Korokan next to the baseball stadium:

Just as hashi, chopsticks, convey nourishment to the mouth, so did the
toilet sticks of Korokan, Nara and Heian period, convey shit away from
the anus. Just as one is chosen for the devouring, the other is picked
for expulsion. Just as water seeks the lower level, so does air seek
the higher. And just as one is born in hole and ratio, so does one's
ration slip through the bodies of others.
