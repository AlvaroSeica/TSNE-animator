I do hope one of my hands will be broken. 
I do so want to wait until one of my hands will be broken.
Then time will stretch between one hand and the other.
Did you know you can smell time.
You can smell time.
Then I will be so free and happy and can do a wonderful thing.
No second will pass in my lifetime!
I will do that wonderful thing!

(Please note, I am very serious about my memory's two clocks.)
