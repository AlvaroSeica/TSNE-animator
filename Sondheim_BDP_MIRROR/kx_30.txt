I don't understand and oh I want to.


I needed to reformat, create a margin or a place, a bracketing. Space to
work and think within, blankness, interval or nothing, ma/mu. Desires
interfere; cloth is a flag of perversion. To think beyond the cloth,
relationships of tumescences to the dry. Category of the dry. Boys and
girls follow me into the wilderness. My nakedness is my truth; I am what I
am. I am afraid of nothing. It is the prophecy and the dryness. The truth.
I have embraced fantasies, shuddered within their power. Not to conquer
but to emerge, coated in slime, another human in the guise of the first.
To be naked and broken is to abjure the social. The river. The river bed.
I can look upon you and your desires. Your yearning. Tendency. Yes.
Embrace me. Give me your clothing, your sex, your life. In the dust of the
river. In its bed. Mu/ma. I am frightened of nothing. I am terrified of
nothing. I am afraid of nothing. I am frightened of nothing. Come to the
river. Come to the river. Come to the river. Emerge with me. In the guise
of the first. In the guise of the second. Merge and merge. Merge.
