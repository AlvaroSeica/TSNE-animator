Notes from Utah (Alan)

110812_004: Pain as separating inscription/history from the 
inertness of the body; what's read as history from the outside 
(and thereby entering the social), from the inside is 
unread/unreadable. The inside is pure substance.

110812_005: Inscription carries, until burial, carries a 
specific relationship to the body until burial. Burial is a form 
of reinscription. A line on the body - how is this interpreted 
during life? during death?

110812_012: Inscription => embodiment and maintenance; 
maintenance => retardation: what makes for example virtual 
particles last as long as they do? Retardation - slowing things 
down, copying, duplicating, a poetics of dispersion, 
holding-back. See the phenomenology of numbers: data-base, 
interpretation, intentionality, an immersive situation, memory. 
In doing mathematics, always dealing with temporal processes. In 
pain: everything drops away, definable and immersive situations 
cease to exist.

110812_014: Splintering, splintered nails, leveraging of 
particles, striations, applicable to notions of binding, 
constriction, discomfort.

110816_002: Pain of the signifier: signifier as incision, 
disturbance, splits between the Pale and beyond the Pale. Pain 
beyond the Pale?

The pain of death: horizon foreclosing its origin and the 
subject as well.

110816_003: The work I do as obdurate, not grid or mapping, but 
flows that are not channelized, flows that are mute - relation 
to pain. The phenomenology of the embodiment of the signifier is 
also mute.

What I do is planless, expands into available technology on a 
practical level, produces and reproduces that way.

110816_006: My Textbook of Thinking: components of inscription: 
linkage, syntactical structure, inscription is an ordering of 
difference, impulse, representation-structure, legitimation 
structure, maintenance, stabilization mechanisms, 
positive/negative feedback, field of abjection. Excessive 
related to corrosion. Difference between fissure and 
inscription. Relationship of corrosion and scarcity to pain.

110816_007: Phenomenology of eccentric space, Sarduy, 
de-centering the subject, tied to abjection.

110816_008: Difference between fissure and inscription; pain 
tends towards fissure; if fissure is same and same, there's no 
geography, no topography, no topology; the result is the crack / 
wound, everywhere and nowhere.

110818_001: Pain relates to the body as cosmology to the 
universe. (?)

110819_001: Pain in relation to virtual worlds: in 
circumlocution of the subject who may remain impervious, the 
degree zero of phenomenology.

Center for Jewish Studies talk at UMN, 12/02/13


Thanks to the wonderful presentations by Elizabeth Workman, 
Maria Damon, and Eric Lorberer, and thanks for the amazing 
dance/choreography in my talk by Foofwa d'Imobilite, Azure 
Carter, and Maud Liardon, as well as song by Azure Carter.

I put my own talk up at http://www.alansondheim.org/Jewish.mp3
- without the video of course; some of it might be worth 
hearing. I do want to especially thank Eric for his introduction 
and responses to all of us. I also put up a text of manipulated
examples at http://www.alansondheim.org/examples.txt . Enjoy.

Straw

They toiled mightily in their homeland, erecting an enormous dam 
in order to bring electrification to the downtrodden farmers and 
small merchants who lived by their wits enslaved by the tawdry 
religious institutions that held them in bondage for eons while 
they uselessly toiled for others well up in the food-chain who 
cared not a wit about anything except the straw which hardened 
the river mud in order to create the towering slopes of an 
enormous dam erected to bring electrification to those same 
downtrodden farmers and peasantry who lived by their wits 
beneath the religious overlords who held them in fiefdom for 
millennia while someone toiled for someone else eating well up 
in the food chain who lived by her wits bringing electrification 
to the enormous towers and their adobe slopes

With the microphone so close to the toiling bow against the

the weight of the heavy mute, it was impossible not to hear 
the toil of the laborers

sweetened straw, on about the tunnel or illuminated rind ice 
against the rim but drawing you in, from pomo to romance, what 
was soiled and toiled now murmurs inside the body, so many 
tissues and organelles

i work through these, i'm not deaf you know, their clarity 
shines for me if for no one else, grant me paranoia
