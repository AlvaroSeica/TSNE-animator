the great wings were beating in the southern darkness. there were 
southern shadows in the darkness moving slowly for 3000 li. all were 
together and in harmony. from the darkness of the north and its depth to 
the darkness of the south and its depth. the peng moved from north to 
south, its great wings beating like black clouds wheeling in the sky.
