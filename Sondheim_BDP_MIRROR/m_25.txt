love in cyberspace 


"
It is one thing to sing the beloved. Another, alas,
to sing that hidden guilty river-god of the blood.
He whom she knows from afar, her young lover, what
does he know of the lord of desire, who from his
  loneliness
often (before the girl eased him, often as if
she did not exist) raised his godhead, dripping with
  what
Unknowable, calling forth the night to infinite tumult?
"

(Rilke, beginning of third Duino elegy, trans. MacIntyre)
(do not get lost in gender here, reverse, transform)

von weitem from afar doubles of desire always lonely
raised within the tensor calculus and ignorant of direction
turned within him the young girl young man desire turned
and reached among dimensions von weitem from afar
unavowed one finger turns endured through this duration
language spilled and swollen towards that other nail
towards nail against nail soft pillow of skin beneath
the firmament above the bone eased towards one another
von weitem from afar

europe sways asia shudders america trembles africa shatters
australia envelops europe shifts america whispers africa
murmurs asia cries australia responds america responds

"
                          the void began to feel
that vibration which now enraptures, consoles and
helps us?
"

(Rilke, ending of first Duino elegy)

emptied or spilled the generator begins its sparks
approximately two and a half centimeters for
twenty-five thousand volts, our hair stands on end
o you who are about to receive this, we die in silence
quantum or brute atomic who promises stolen nights
overlapped plates whole continents in movement earth
jostles us in fissured dreams unease of flesh 
remembered only from another

in every woman i remember you in every other
