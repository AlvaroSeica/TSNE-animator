Parable


Before there was the word, there was no beginning. Nikuko tried to think.
She couldn't think. She didn't have time to think, and she itched. Nikuko
scratched herself and flakes of skin fell into the water. They became
Japan. Nikuko, thought, I will take a swim. Nikuko said, I am swimming,
and her mouth filled with water. She spat it out and it became Lake Biwa.
Did I just say something, said Nikuko. She thought, now I can say all
sorts of things. Just as she thought that, all sorts of things appeared.
They were grey until she said, What a colorful life. They were dark until
she said, I wish it were sunny out. They were hot until she said, I wonder
when it will snow, and they were too shiny until she said Good night.
