Lost Japan for Me


Lost Japan
Japan New and Old
Bygone Days in Old Japan
Japan, A Glimpse into the Past

Japan - Signs - immersed - floor-level, the turning - slates of peoples -
targeting and inverted - decathecting in the bushido zone - looking in
towards interior perfections - closed faces and facades - operatives of
the _brush-stroke_ - if the point/node characterizes the west, the line
characterizes japan - kami linkages - the darkness of the city in my for-
eign night - detailing and intervaling, spacings - mono no aware - wabi
and sabi - the interior forlorn -

Mysterious Japan
Japan, from Geisha to Gaijin

signs determinative of signs, foreign to me, illegible, _watching_ signs
immersed in a world of signs
floor-level, the turning, flatness of spaces, turning everywhere
slates of peoples passing by, peripheral glances, blanked exteriors
targeting and inverted, out of the corner of their eyes, gaijin naked
decathecting in the bushido zone, detumescence, disconnected
looking in towards interior perfections, perfect family-life, burakumin
closed faces and facades, i was never there, lintels, portals
operatives of the brush-stroke, the inscription of the real
point and line, the view-given garden, turned and widening line
kami linkages, everywhere intensities, confabulations of millennia, ages
darkness of the city, gaijin bar to sidewalk to jinja to neon river, night
detailing, intervals and spaces, the ornamental flow, edge intensity
mono no aware, my last weeks, last night long walk past the zen temple
wabi and sabi, this body, moments of despair and worn sailings

Japanese Wonders and Beauties

on the night of the interior forlorn, i have never finished with japan,
it's an open wound, a space in consciousness, a flood, olden days in
japan, images impenetrable, the gulf absolute, the rupture, and division
of new and old, division of here and there

Japan Inside and Out

it's what i remember, every detail of the 7-11 store-shelves, walking be-
hind hakozaki shrine, details which reappear in dreams, the second-hand
shop on the corner and its shogi sets, more and more lists, the children
staring at me yelling back 'baka baka'

Life and Loves of the Ancient Japanese
Oh! Japan!

i can't assimilate the transformation, the kanji disappeared, certain
paintings, glances, edges of things, always felt myself at odds with each
and every gaijin, o third country of the spirit, it's what i remember, i'm
dreadfully afraid of reconstitution, making it up as i go along, the
things themselves retreated into algorithms for reconstruction, right or
wrong, 'my japanese days,' 'my time in japan,' as well as more personal
material intertwined, inseparable, confusioned, contusion

The Presuppositions of the Myth of Japanese Homogeneity

haunted with an incontrovertible knot set in my maw my brainstem my hole,
kabuki samurai misrecognitions, never made it to the theater, parks wet
with leaves, moats, stone stupas, my gaijin head smashed among them as i
leapt out of the country of noh truth as literal as possible
