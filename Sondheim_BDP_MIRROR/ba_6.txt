On the Mountain the Prophets Went Up

and profitably got some images finally, the screen swinging back and forth
on the laptop in the wind, a towel held down over it to see the image qua-
lity in the sunlight, vague shapes like inked Sesshu but of course cruder,
not that many pixels available! Against pines and cragged rocks similar
landscaping and intensity late afternoon early evening light, wonder what
this would be like in old-growth forest, fifty miles in on gravel roads
computer bouncing around? Worth worhty or not, there are always trips to 
take in digital land... 

And from the height of the other mountain, the smaller, on the flat con-
crete top of the water tank what would be embedded there but a single
line, all blue capitals, from one side perfectly to the other: 

HERE COME OED FLATTOP HE COME GROOVIN' UP SLOWLY HE GOT JOOJOO EYEBALL HE 
                              ONE HOLY


And yes! yes! yes! Captured on my HP palmtop, hardly the way to go for
graffiti concrete inscription. And on the left, from clearly another wri-
ter, a poem about love carrying the line along: 

NOTHING BITES LIKE THE JAWS OF THE LOVED

But then he/she hasn't been on the Net, where @bite rules the world, where
all images are digital, where even what's hunted and brought back files 
itself one by one by one, all ready from the Prophet on the Mount down to 
the Mounted Prophet, myself supine before the keys, sending this out to 
nonexistent you o love love love!
