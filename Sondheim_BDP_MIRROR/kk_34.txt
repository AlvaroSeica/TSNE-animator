	I COULD BE A KING
	I COULD BE AN EMPEROR OR A TERRIFIC QUEEN
	I WILL KILL EMPERORS, PRESIDENTS, KINGS, UTTERLY
	UTTERLY I WILL DESTROY THEM
	YOU ARE @DESTROYED UTTERLY
	YOU ARE AN ALDERMAN
	BY MY NAME I HAVE DESTROYED YOU
	YOU CAN'T READ THIS ANY LONGER YOU ARE DESTROYED
	YOU'RE GONE FOREVER FROM HERE DONE WITH MURDERED IN COLD BLOOD
	I HAVE RAISED ARMIES OF MEN AND WOMEN GIRLS AND YOUNG BOYS
	MYRIADS I HAVE RAISED I AM AN ASTRONAUT
	THEY HAVE ALL BEEN LITTERED WITH CORPSES I BROOK NO SURVIVOR
	NOTHING LIVES WITHIN MY THOUSAND MILES
	I COULD KILL STARLETS IN WHITE BATHROBES HUNKS IN BRIEFS
	I WILL DESTROY HONEST DOCTORS SAVING HONEST WOUNDED
	I COULD DO WHAT I WILL DO
	I WILL DO WHAT I COULD DO
	I COULD BE AN OPERA STAR I COULD SING TO YOU
	I WILL SING TO YOU I COULD BE A TERRIFIC EMPEROR
	I COULD BE A TERRIFIC QUEEN
