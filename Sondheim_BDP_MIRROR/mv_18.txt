You, Dance Before the War!

Me, the sun encloses the dance-runner with my unemployment friend of the 
immobilized!

I am a child before the worlds. I have an umbrell or a parasol. I am the
City of Trieste! a sad person. She is my copulating coquette.

Before the war or after? I have needs. I have an other need, says Rimbaud. 
Run! Run! And don't return! It's me!

Alas, then, the war! Tomorrow, we die. To be or not to be has the agony,
that is the question! We die, an English idiot or the cretins. The
soldiers march to battle, to knock-out! I am the tree of the worl! Alas,
unemployment! Alas, then, to work the wounded! I have my three little
points. I think. I am a rock, couch me down tonight? Pardon, I am
desolated!

Tomorrow, we sacrifice our life for the dance! Two morrows, we assist at
the last blow! Tomorrow, to assassinate. I am a potato of the moon...  
Alas then! Come with me, kleptomaniac! We are our knees. To the arms! To
the arms!

We are the gift of God to the earth. We sacrifice ourselves! Where are the
snows of last year? I am the others. I am Dreyfus. My friend, it's Foofwa
d'imobilite, he to dance-runner the beautiful war. Me? I exist. But he is
a terrible child!

Today, we think by the side of the river Susquehanna. Very beautiful! It
snows. The Pax Romana. But I hear the carillons of War. I am a realis. I
do not believe nothing. The sun is too haut, to hut, for animal or
vegetable life. Plankton... The plasma... Sun!

I live by the moon! IN the moon! I see all the worls! Screen!
