From the Backbone of Now to the Backbone of a Long Time Ago


Close the eyes and god goes away, I think it's a terrific deal.
Tue Sep 28 18:58:10 EDT 1999 is not the time now, for example; god
wouldn't let me enter the time now but did let me enter this old time.
I like the old time. I like thinking about the old time. God lets me do
that, god is pretty terrific, is a good god. 
I want to sleep now.
Management has taken care of everything; god is a voice-over. 
A voice-over, and that makes it
all right, saying the date and time from the past, crying over 
that Tue Sep 28 18:58:10 EDT 1999, which won't come
again.
