Film on the Eyes


There's a blasted landscape in the rain, a small seaside village, asphalt
road soaked in the downpour beneath dark grey skies. Azure sits at a table
where a man is dissecting a fish over and over again in a shallow rectang-
ular pan. It's being filmed, and she has to sit there, the willing student
for twelve hours at a go; we need the money, she needs the experience. The
cameras are nowhere to be seen.

I'm jealous, all twisted up inside. We're supposed to go to Pennsylvania,
to see my mother who's quite sick. But this is an excuse for me, for my
insecurities to rage. I want her to work, remain independent; I want her
to come with me; I want to possess her; I hate myself; I want her to be
free; I want her independent of what I want for her, from her, in her.  
I'm all twisted up inside; it turns nightmarish, revolves around all too
familiar tensions; I can't think straight; there's no way out; everything
is run-on, turning back on itself; I wake up, sweating; the room is light.

Azure goes down to get the mail; I'm writing this; in the back of my mind
there's that sea-side town; everything is dark; there are trees with
cragged and broken branches; the trees are blasted by the wind; they're
outlined against the dark and violent sky; the man at the table and Azure
are soaked; I see them from a point of view slightly behind her, above
her left shoulder; she's watching the dissection, slightly distanced; the
camera doesn't move, just swings on occasion to the street, which is also
the main street, shops with small windows, dark wooden fronts; nothing
happens except my emotions; they're turning around inside; the sea is an-
gry and frothing; there's a small sea wall behind the man who sits facing
Azure and dissecting; it's cut stone, the terrace in front of the wall is
also cut stone; the two chairs and the table are the only furniture; the
terrace is empty otherwise. In the background, the contract; Azure will
remain there for the duration of the film; the film will be made in the
wind and the rain. Further in the background, my emotions, out of control,
impotent, churning and devouring me. Further still, the dream, the bed,
the room, the sun shattering the street outside, Azure and I waking, my
telling her the dream.


(I think of a film, The Phoenix and the Squid, the animal writhing and 
dissected on the tray, cream-white belly open, I'm working hard at the 
wounded child inside me, clawing at my throat, my brain, my thighs:

The film ends in electronics sputtering out, the tray full of organs 
and liquid debris, logs in the water, ruined exports.)
