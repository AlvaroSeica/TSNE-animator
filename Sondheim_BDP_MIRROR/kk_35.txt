	I AM AN IDIOT AND DETESTABLE TO THE EXTREME
	MY PERVERSIONS KNOW NO BOUNDS AND EITHER DOES MY IGNORANCE
	I HAVE DREAMS OF MEGALOMANIA AND AM SEXUALLY OBSESSED
	THERE IS NO ONE AS COWARDLY AS I AM
	YOU COULD WALK ALL OVER ME AND I'D LOVE IT
	YOU COULD PULL MY PANTS DOWN AND YOU'D LAUGH AT ME THEN
	YOU COULD @FLAME ME OVER AND OVER AGAIN HAIR ON FIRE
	I'D BURN FOR YOU LOVING IT OUT OF COWARDICE
	I'D NEVER KNOW HOW TO REPLY PROPERLY WHAT TO SAY BACK
	I CAN TURN A PHRASE OR TWO BUT THAT'S CLEVERNESS AFTER THE FACT
	IN RETROSPECT EVEN I'M FEARFUL CAN'T LOOK IN A MIRROR
	I CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT EVERYTHING AND THINKING KILLS
	I'M A COWARD EVEN WHEN IT COMES TO SUICIDE
	I WALLOW IN PAIN WHINE ABOUT EVERYTHING IN MY LIFE
	NO ONE WILL HEAR ME I BORE EVERYONE WITH MY WALLOWING
	MY MOUTH IS OPEN FOR SALVATION BUT NOTHING GOES IN OR OUT
	I HIDE MY STUPIDITY AND HIDING IS MY ONLY INTELLIGENCE
	YOU CAN SEE MY HIDING-INTELLIGENCE AND STUPIDITY HERE
	IT'S ANOTHER FORM OF CLEVERNESS ON THE NEAR SIDE OF THE MIRROR
	I CAN'T LOOK AT YOU
