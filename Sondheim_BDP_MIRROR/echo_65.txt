to say that i am in nirvana is to say that i am not in nirvana. to say

that i am not in nirvana is to say that i am in nirvana and i have escaped

from samsaras. i am in nirvana and i have escaped from samsaras. i have

not escaped from samsaras. i have not escaped from samsara. i nikuko reco-

gnize the emptiness of all things. i nikuko do not recognize the emptiness

of all things; i recognize nothing; i am capable of recognizing nothing; i

am capable of only recognizing nothing. i alan do not recognize things and

i recognize the convention of things. i recognize the convention of the

non-recognition of things and of the non-recognition of all things. i rec-

ognize the convention of the non-recognition of things and of the non-

recognition of all things. who would say that i am in nirvana, who would

say that i am alan, who would say that i am nikuko, who would say that i

am alan, who would say that i am nikuko. who would say that she is not in

nirvana, who would say that he is not in nirvana. no one ever escapes from

nirvana; who would say that nikuko is in samsara or alan is in samsara.  

who would say that he or she escapes.
