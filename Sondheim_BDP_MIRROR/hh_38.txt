The Bridge

by Hart Crane


bridge paw lion water water lion paw bridge
so that the older industrial industrial older
wire here divided
each element is absolutely perfect
egyptian sphinx claw bridge liquid bridge claw
each pixel beauty address x and y
multiplied there fibered
in order to computation age age computation
hungered foot panther fluid fluid panther foot hungered

the field of the panther weighs in perfect water water perfect
where wire fibered adds subtracts unknown unknown abstracts
ends bridged, wait here while i told you so
down to the footed field of lion sphinx panther sphinx lion
it's weight here. i told you so.
